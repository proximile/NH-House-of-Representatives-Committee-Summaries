we're in session
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%

there's an amendment on this
 
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment on this
that

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think comports to our conversation
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
on wednesday
 
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.230 align:start position:0%
on wednesday
has

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
i assume not everyone in the committee
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
has had an opportunity to look at 1604
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment is that right
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative weber representative
 
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
representative weber representative
woods

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
woods
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
right right right and you you didn't
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
benefit from last week's conversation so
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a moment to look over it
 
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a moment to look over it
um

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
can you point out what's changed i i
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
will i didn't want to talk while they're
 
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
will i didn't want to talk while they're
reading

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
you ready okay
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
so so what this amendment uh attempted
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
to do and and i think it has um
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
substantially done and if not completely
 
00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.270 align:start position:0%
substantially done and if not completely
is

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
area of religious exemption
 
00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.350 align:start position:0%
area of religious exemption
was

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
a little quiet
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of what was needed
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
by the employer to evaluate whether or
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
not they've got a good religious
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
exemption document
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
this this basically
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
spells out how the employer is to
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate the religious exemption
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
largely it says
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
have more of a bureaucratic function
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
than to sit in judgment
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
i think that's because we wanted to
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
honor the prime sponsors
 
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
honor the prime sponsors
thought

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
and the house vote that um
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
real since since the government is here
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
to protect religious freedom
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem appropriate for the
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
government to mandate um
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
to oversee and evaluate the religious
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
beliefs of an employee so
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
their role has been limited to
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
evaluating the completeness of the
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork process
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
they they do have the ability to deny
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
one if they believe that there
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
is a is compelling evidence of some kind
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
of a fraud
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's what that amendment
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
no i just say thank you mr chairman um
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like
 
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like
um

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
from a quick reading that it's simply
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
explains more carefully what the
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
procedure is going to be and therefore
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
a particular change over anything that
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
we've already seen thank you
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
that that was our intent and that's
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
certainly what i hope happened with this
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think it has is there are there any
 
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
i think it has is there are there any
other

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions or comments um because if not
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'd take a motion to con vote on the
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative weiler
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
have we looked at what the form looks
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
like that they have to fill out remember
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
there was one that was being distributed
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
that was very
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh complete and and they wanted all
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
sorts of information about the person
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
where do you go to church how often do
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
you go who is your leader and all this
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that was one of that
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair question and i
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's it's answered and uh
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll satisfy you um it says that
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
the exemption shall simply state which
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
to me means this is what it will state
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
i insert the requester's name hereby
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
attest that i sincerely hold religious
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
beliefs and or engage in religious
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
practice or observe observances
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
that dictate the refusal to accept the
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
required vaccination
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then the signature is there with
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
along with the date there there aren't
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions that could be
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
extraneous like which church do you go
 
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
extraneous like which church do you go
to

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
i moved the amendment
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
is there a second
second

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative bean
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
so we're going to conduct a role a roll
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
call vote on whether we accept amendment
 
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
call vote on whether we accept amendment
2022-1160

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.010 align:start position:0%

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
2022-1160
[Music]

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
chairman edwards yes
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's seven to nothing uh and we'll
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
send that to the uh full finance
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee for review on wednesday
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
is there a volunteer to write
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
the committee report often referred to
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative wyler will write the
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
and of course it's just a draft so that
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's quick and easy processing
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
depending on how the committee votes on
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
wednesday it's i don't think we need a
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.389 align:start position:0%
yes
sir

00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
the the next vote is on
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
1608 as we just amended
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question
 
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:22.069 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question
[Music]

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
so on a four to three vote we'll pass
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
that to um the full committee and that
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
and that's the one you'll be writing a
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
draft blurb for
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're going to
 
00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're going to
1608

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
1608
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
relative to withdrawal from the state
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
immunization registry is there is there
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we submitted on this
 
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we submitted on this
one

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
i need i'm checking my own notes in case
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
if i could there's no amendment on that
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
one and that was one of the bills that
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
as amended by the house doesn't have a
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right so the guidance on this is
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't have a fiscal impact
 
00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.189 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't have a fiscal impact
that

00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
we we do a blurb that essentially says
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
this has no fiscal impact and therefore
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're returning it to the um
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
full house
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then that is an example of if
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
finance accepts that then it can go on
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
to the consent calendar if there's no
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
objective objection
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i i think we've had the discussion
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
around 1608 and
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i would entertain a motion
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
i i would entertain a motion
to

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
recommend an otp with the uh blurb that
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
basically says no fiscal impact
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
therefore we have no
 
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
therefore we have no
removed

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's moved by representative irf is it
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
our second
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative walner
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh mr clerk would you call us
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh this we're gonna we're the motion is
 
00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.230 align:start position:0%
uh this we're gonna we're the motion is
otp

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
otp
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh and then and then the blurb basically
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh explains it to the whole house that
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
there was no fiscal impact and therefore
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
the finance committee has not taken a
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
position on it other than to reflect the
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i will just note that this one was
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous coming out of our committee as
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
more proof that great minds think alike
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
conduct a roll call on 1608 with an otp
 
00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:55.509 align:start position:0%
conduct a roll call on 1608 with an otp
motion

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.519 --> 00:16:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you that vote is seven to zero
 
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
uh thank you that vote is seven to zero
um

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to 1662.
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh we discussed this last week as well
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and we drafted an amendment for
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
this that is uh
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
to do two things
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the first thing is on lines three
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
through four and it's simply a
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
clarification that the
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments which is a
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
written risk assessment and mitigation
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
written risk assessment and mitigation
plan

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
that that is for each it system
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
and not just um
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the department overall
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
so on line three it says for each it
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
system that that that's a key one
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then the other was that the
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
department had done a a better analysis
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
of the personnel and
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
said that we should
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
change it to a labor grade 30.
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see on line 21 grade 30 is
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
cited and then the financial impact is
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted based on that grade change
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what this amendment does is
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
there is there any discussion on the
 
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:43.830 align:start position:0%
there is there any discussion on the
amendment

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any anyone
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
interested in discussing the amendment
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
um so i'll move the amendment you'll
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
or a question that they want to address
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
on 1609
 
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
on 1609
rep

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
representative weber and then
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would just point
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
out that there isn't any fiscal impact
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
again this is again one that has no
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and it has been passed by
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
both the
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
policy committee and the house so i
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
would hope that the recommendation would
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
be ought to pass
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
with the attendant blurb explaining that
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact uh representative
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um there is a tiny amount of a
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact but as we discussed last
 
00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact but as we discussed last
monday

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
monday
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's my view and a view i've
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
coordinated with um
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.470 align:start position:0%
coordinated with um
the

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
the discussions and agreements around
 
00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
the discussions and agreements around
hb2

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
required a particular
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
crafting of what went into hb2
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
as part of what we did to make sure that
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
there was enough agreement that we got
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
the total budget passed
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
and that was kind of a nice milestone
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
because the prior two terms a budget did
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
not get passed and so we we essentially
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
got it done
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
so so because 1609
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.230 align:start position:0%
so so because 1609
addresses

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
an issue that was so fundamental to
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
getting uh the support necessary for the
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
state to pass a budget
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
i i do see a very significant fiscal
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
impact here that isn't shown in the in
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the methodology
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
and and i'm just concerned
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
if um we basically go back on our word
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we made less than a year ago when
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're needing to negotiate
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
the next budget
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether the republicans or democrats are
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
in charge it's still an issue of
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
credibility within the finance committee
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
if if we make an agreement will we hold
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the agreement and
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
i i want to say yes we will
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's what i think is
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
the rationale
 
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.830 align:start position:0%
the rationale
for

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
are taking a a stance on 1609 as uh as
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it got amended
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
so i do do you have
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
well you and i have a difference of
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
opinion about this i i feel like there's
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
often in budgets
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
that we've passed in the
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
past in the past and probably will in
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are things that are in budgets at
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
the time that we pass them
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that in the two-year cycle do end up
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
programs

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
or policies don't work out the way
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
people thought they would that we
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
changed them during the two-year cycle
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
that as if we
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
if we lived by that what it would mean
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that we would never change anything
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
in a two-year cycle because we promised
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the budget would look the way
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
we passed it on whatever it was
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
june of
 
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
june of
2000

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.029 align:start position:0%
 
20.

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
20.
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
no 21. sorry sorry about that um that we
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
would nothing would change in that
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
during the whole two years so
 
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.310 align:start position:0%
during the whole two years so
um

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i think it's not really a
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
good argument for it being a financial
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.549 align:start position:0%
good argument for it being a financial
implication

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
implication
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
all right i i can accept your argument
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
as being a valid and
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
faithfully held argument
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
having been in the midst of the storm
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
i know there were about three
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
major agreements that were critical
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
and one of them was fmli for example
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's what was necessary to make sure
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
the governor was on board and that's why
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
i voted for the repeal of fmli is
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
because i made a promise to the governor
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
and so this because of the criticality
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
of this to the agreement
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to vote to itl um
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
may i have a motion move itl
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
some moved by representative irf
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative weiler would
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
4 3 itl um
 
00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:51.029 align:start position:0%
4 3 itl um
oh

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'll write the blurb for this one as
 
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.909 align:start position:0%
i'll write the blurb for this one as
well

00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we're on to 16
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't think we
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
formally write committee reports out of
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
the division i i'm i'm wanting to get it
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
done in advance
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you wrong
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know who's going to be
 
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know who's going to be
accountable

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner accountable
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
for the minority report
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh hb 1622 relative to notice that
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
a health care provider is no longer
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
accepting new patients in relative to
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
mental health parity
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment on this one
 
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment on this one
[Music]

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
no there's no amendment on this one
 
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.909 align:start position:0%
no there's no amendment on this one
no

00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment on this one
 
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.230 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment on this one
1622

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
1622
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
and this was another bill that
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note currently reads that hhs
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
thinks there may be a small fiscal
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
impact but based on the department's
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
testimony last week there won't actually
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
be one so the fiscal note will be
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
revised accordingly
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right so i i think this hues to the
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
argument that we should just pass otp
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
based on the policy
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee's vote in the whole house
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
since it does not have a fiscal impact
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we've already written a blurb
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
that'll say substantially that we can
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
just repurpose the blurb if
 
00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:39.750 align:start position:0%
just repurpose the blurb if
if

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
we end up deciding to otp on this
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%

um

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
chairman edward yes
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you uh with a vote on
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
that uh in
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
agreeing that
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
is there any disagreement that we can
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
just repurpose the blurb
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
no no so we'll just go with the same
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
blurb that we used before
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative walner has crafted an
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
amendment on this
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
um would you explain your amendment to
 
00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:21.909 align:start position:0%
um would you explain your amendment to
us

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
it'll take me a few years to using the
 
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.190 align:start position:0%
it'll take me a few years to using the
mic

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
mic
 
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.950 align:start position:0%
mic
um

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
this was the bill about um
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
the results of lead testing
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
be included on
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
the health form that schools and
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
child care providers
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
receive on children and as we talked
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
about it last
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
time which was
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago we talked about
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we did not
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
children denied access to care
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
they had not
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
either the form was not filled in with
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
the lead levels
 
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:09.190 align:start position:0%
the lead levels
testing

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
on it or
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
they had not had it the idea was to this
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
is to incent to get parents to do the
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
work but not to deny children in their
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
access to child care
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
or um to school so the amendment which
 
00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:29.110 align:start position:0%
or um to school so the amendment which
is

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
11 59 h is that right kevin
 
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
11 59 h is that right kevin
yep

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
yep
yes

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually says um
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
the health form shall include
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
at least one result of blood level
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
testing required under rsa 130-a
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
colon 5
 
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.789 align:start position:0%
colon 5
a

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:53.269 align:start position:0%
a
or

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.549 align:start position:0%
 
rsa-130-a5

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
colon

00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
c a child shall not be removed from or
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
denied entry to child care facilities
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
due to lack of blood lead
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
level test
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
so i
then

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
my reasoning on it is it is
 
00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
my reasoning on it is it is
certainly

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is certainly policy
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
but for families it certainly is a
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
financial has fam
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
real serious financial ramifications
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
if they can't access child care or if
 
00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
if they can't access child care or if
they

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
have to be in child care and have their
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
child removed so
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that uh
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
mr ripple i i think this may be
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
a bill in which the fiscal note was to
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
be amended because the one that we have
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
before us still says that the insurance
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
department states that in order to meet
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
the bill's requirements it'll hire three
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
full-time positions could you could you
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
straighten us out on where we're at on
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
i think the fiscal note for this one
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
suggested that the only impact might be
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
to local school districts
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
and based on what we heard last week the
 
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.430 align:start position:0%
and based on what we heard last week the
form

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
already includes the information being
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
requested so there won't actually be a
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
what i think i just heard you say and
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for clarity is that the
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal note needs to be
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh amended and that the request for
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
three full-time positions removed
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
i think the request for three positions
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
was on a different bill uh bill that
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
you've already voted on but yes the
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this bill will be
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
revised to say no impact
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
all right just
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
for those playing at home
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
the the bill hb 1622 is introduced
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
on on page
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
three where the
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note picks up the second
 
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal note picks up the second
paragraph

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
does say the insurance department states
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
that uh in order to meet the
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
requirements it'll need to hire three
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
full-time positions
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
each starting at july 1
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
2022 the estimated costs are as follows
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
salaries but it doesn't look like that's
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
would cover three full-time employees
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
just give me one more moment
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
and then it also goes on to say the
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
department states that the bill's impact
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
on insurance premium tax revenue if any
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
is indeterminable so so i do see a
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
i believe the fiscal note dates from the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
original bill which had um a reporting
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirement uh for the schools and that
 
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
requirement uh for the schools and that
and

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
and they had to report i believe to dhhs
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
which is why
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
there was a significant concern
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
and that was taken out in committee if i
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
am recalling correctly and
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative woods can
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong on that
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
but i will i will also state while i've
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
got the microphone that
 
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.190 align:start position:0%
got the microphone that
um

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by representative
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
walner does certainly represent the
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the committee which was to
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
create more ways of incentivizing
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
checking the levels for kids and making
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
sure that that happened but it was never
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee that a child
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue at school
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
we were considering the health aspects
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
and perhaps not quite as clear as we
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
should have been on the
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
the school aspects but it was we don't
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
we didn't
want

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
removal from school to be a a
 
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
removal from school to be a a
consequence

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
all right i think uh representative
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
canark when he was standing in for hhs
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
did make that point which is why the
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
amendment got crafted as it did i i just
 
00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
amendment got crafted as it did i i just
uh

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i looked to the lba to be the official
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
arbiter on the status of fiscal notes
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i just want before the fiscal
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee or the finance committee votes
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we know what the fiscal note is
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to say yep and it'll say no impact
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i just want to clarify for the
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
record i think some of these bills have
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
similar numbers 1622 was relative to
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
mental health parity i think that one
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
had the original cost 1642 didn't have
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
the positions
 
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.349 align:start position:0%
the positions
and

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
it did originally have a fiscal note but
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've since amended it
 
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
we've since amended it
um

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
to say the only impact will be to locals
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll amend that again to say no
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
cost at all
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so i i'll i'll take you at your
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
word you know what you're you're doing
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
so to the state
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
i think we can vote assuming that there
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
is no state cost to doing this
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
um but that we are adding an enforcement
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
cost at an indeterminable level to the
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
local schools because we're asking them
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
to do more and we're not sending them
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
any money to do it
 
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.150 align:start position:0%
any money to do it
so

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
i like the amendment so i'll vote for
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment but i intend to vote
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
against 1622
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
because i think it violates uh article
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
28 a which is our no
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate rule if if we want to
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
come back and amendment amend this in
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
the in the full finance committee to pay
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
for it uh so that the schools aren't
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
just doing more with less
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would or at least more with the same i
 
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.550 align:start position:0%
i would or at least more with the same i
i

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think that would be good but i don't
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
have that amendment today
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%

i'm looking at our vice chair do you
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh i and i just want to i just want
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
your hand if you're here from the
 
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.470 align:start position:0%
your hand if you're here from the
department

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
i got one two i got i got two folks so
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is the other thing that i want to
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
say about this bill
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is great we want our kids tested
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
for lead i voted for the requirement
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
that our kids get tested
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
early before
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
daycare and then before schools i voted
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
for that i'm i want the testing
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
philosophically i'm opposed to this
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
because i don't want the legislature to
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
lean on the school system to be our
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
enforcer i think that messes up the
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
relationship of an educator to the
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
parents and to the family and so what i
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
would encourage the the department to do
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
is to develop with others
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
a public health education program so
 
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
a public health education program so
that

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know we're out of covid now so all
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
the coveted reasons for not going and
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
getting it done those are should be
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
behind us let's educate our parents to
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
let them know why this is such a great
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
idea we don't wear seat belts
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
or we don't have a seatbelt law and we
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
wear our seat belts more than they do in
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts it's we'll do rational
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
things if we understand why it's
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
rational so if we
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not opposed to lead testing
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done we just i just want
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're doing it with
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
our citizens so
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i think we're on
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:05.850 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
this is
[Music]

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
relative to income eligibility for in
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
and out
 
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.109 align:start position:0%
and out
and

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
i have an amendment to introduce to this
 
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:16.650 align:start position:0%
i have an amendment to introduce to this
um

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:16.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.829 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
if we accepted everything and the
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
amendment number is 1121 by the way
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
if we accepted everything that was in
 
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
if we accepted everything that was in
the

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it came over to us 1526
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment does that too
 
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
this amendment does that too
also

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
what what it does that's different
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
though is
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
instead of funding the entire
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
year that begins uh july 1
 
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.150 align:start position:0%
year that begins uh july 1
2022

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
so in a few months and going for a full
 
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.670 align:start position:0%
so in a few months and going for a full
year

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
what it does is it just funds the last
 
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.349 align:start position:0%
what it does is it just funds the last
quarter

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the next year okay so so it'll still
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
be in this budget it's a change to this
 
00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.230 align:start position:0%
be in this budget it's a change to this
budget

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
but it's only for
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
three months instead of 12 months
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
so what was the thinking behind that the
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
thinking behind that
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
once the budget's in we should try not
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
to affect it unless it's really
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
important and this is really important
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm okay with affecting it
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat but not for the full year
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
um i i've gotten the support of the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
finance chair and the speaker to support
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
one quarter of a year instead of the
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
full thing if we approve this as a house
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the senate accepts
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
it will become law before
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget process starts
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so what that will enable them to do
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
is to go ahead
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
and anticipate this program being in
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
place for the full year or the full
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
budget cycle in the next budget
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
so that they can do the analysis and
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
give us the the total budget cost then
 
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.349 align:start position:0%
give us the the total budget cost then
so

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
what what i'm asking you to do
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
because i would have to vote itl on 1526
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
without this amendment what i'm asking
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
is to accept
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
amendment 1121 which
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
allows 1526 to go over to the senate if
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
finance agrees with us
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
but with funding just one quarter of the
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
year instead of the full 12 months
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
so is there any conversation on that
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
well i would have much preferred us to
 
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.990 align:start position:0%
well i would have much preferred us to
have

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
funded it for the full year
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
and considering that our revenues are
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
at a very very good pace
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
we could do a little bit better for this
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
i would love to see us
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
be able to come in at least for half a
 
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
be able to come in at least for half a
year

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
but i think the
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
important piece is that we get it in
 
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.270 align:start position:0%
important piece is that we get it in
place

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
and have it ongoing and in the next
 
00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
and have it ongoing and in the next
budget

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
and um i will vote against the amendment
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
is there any other conversation
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
so so representative allner uh thank you
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
and um if you were to bring
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the full finance committee uh in
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
two days uh i think that would be a
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
great topic of conversation
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
i will do that thank you thank you
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay um so with that
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to do a show hands on
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.589 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay so uh with that
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
we can move on to
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
um house bill 1531
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
repealing certain statutory commissions
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
relating to children
 
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
relating to children
and

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'll go first to mr ripple
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
to verify my understanding my
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is an updated fiscal note
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
would indicate that this has no fiscal
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
impact is that correct that's correct
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay so uh it it feels to me that we
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
ought to do what we've done on two prior
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
bills where we uh pass it otp onto the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
full finance committee with the
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
the blurb essentially saying the same
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing we've said which is no fiscal
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
impact therefore we're just passing the
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh bill back to the house and uh i i
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe the finance chair would want to
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
put it on consent at that point
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's been moved otp
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative bean
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
mr clerk when you're ready would you
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
three

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.069 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay so 1531
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
passes 7-0
 
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
passes 7-0
otp

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
otp
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.950 align:start position:0%
today's
today's

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
today's
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
approach is out of sync with
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
joint parenting
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
so let's say one parent has 45 percent
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
the parenting and the other has 55
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.589 align:start position:0%
 
where

00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
the woman 45 gets zero
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
child support and the other gets 100
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
percent it's not right
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
now this state has been dealing with
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
this for years no it's been a problem
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
in in 2018 this finance committee
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
funded a five hundred thousand
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
dollar research uh report and it was
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
done by the carsey uh center
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that report gave many
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations i mean obviously we
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
spent five hundred thousand on this as a
 
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
spent five hundred thousand on this as a
state

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
something's broken for us to do that and
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
reflects many of the recommendations
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
that were in that report
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
now in 2020
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
there was a supreme court case anderson
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
versus anderson
 
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.349 align:start position:0%
versus anderson
which

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
which they refused to take well they
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
took but then they said wait a minute
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're tired of this we're tired of all
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
these cases from lower courts coming to
 
00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:02.549 align:start position:0%
these cases from lower courts coming to
us

00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't define
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
we need to define
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
child support better
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
than we do
 
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
than we do
and

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.870 align:start position:0%
and
and

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
and they said fix it
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
now i was in this position a couple of
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
years ago
when

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
when we had the issue of how towns were
 
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:22.549 align:start position:0%
when we had the issue of how towns were
assessing

00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
we got a formula
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
i said has chaired that commission
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
i said it's got to be a simple formula
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we got and we passed it and
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
that was a 40-year problem that we
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
solved this is similar we got a problem
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's been around a long long time
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
and we need we needed to fix it and this
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill does just that
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
so and it passed out of uh children and
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
if it passed on the floor
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
so there's two things you're probably
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear after yeah brenda there
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
may be others testifying about
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
wow some are going to say well this is
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
going to create more caucasian court
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
cases i i beg to differ on that
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
why why
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
we have we have examples vermont has
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
been doing this exact language we have
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
or not exact language but the similar
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a formula
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
that they're using and they found that
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
their court cases reduced over time
 
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.470 align:start position:0%
their court cases reduced over time
significantly

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
we got some more data from kentucky
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
who's has this law
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
implemented for for a while now a
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
similar law
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
those court cases reduced by eleven
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.870 align:start position:0%
those court cases reduced by eleven
percent

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
but i think the other thing that
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
finance has to look at because i'm
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
trying i was trying to initially trying
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
to figure out why it came to finance
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
a number
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
something called a self-support reserve
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that got increased in the bill
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
because carsey center said you should do
 
00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.349 align:start position:0%
because carsey center said you should do
this

00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:02.630 align:start position:0%
this
raised

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
raised this allowance from 115 to 120
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty level
 
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty level
and

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
and there may be
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
some issue with public funding that
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
might be lost
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh because of that but brenda understood
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
been the town understands this much
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
better than i do
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i know she's going to be addressing
 
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.309 align:start position:0%
and i know she's going to be addressing
this

00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers aren't going to be that
 
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
the numbers aren't going to be that
great

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
if that happens a matter of fact in the
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it says indeterminable i
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
know we get a lot of that indeterminable
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
we get that in ways and means too
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh but i i don't think it's going to be
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
because the the the increase only goes
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
from fourteen thousand eight hundred and
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
twelve dollars
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
to fifteen thousand four hundred and
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
fifty six dollars which is not a big big
 
00:50:54.079 --> 00:50:59.190 align:start position:0%
fifty six dollars which is not a big big
increase

00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
120 percent again it's in the fiscal
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
note it should be
 
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.230 align:start position:0%
note it should be
um

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
i i think it's also in the fiscal note
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is in the asm no the
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
bill wasn't
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
and and uh miss town can uh explain this
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
a lot better than i can
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's one question i'd like to ask you
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure uh in your testimony you said that
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
you think that the
 
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.470 align:start position:0%
you think that the
litigation

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
if we pass this would decrease
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says um the opposite the
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch states that the bill
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
will likely result in additional
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
litigation in certain instances in which
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
child support would be reduced by the
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
new guidelines
 
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
new guidelines
so

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
why why do you think they've got it
 
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.630 align:start position:0%
why why do you think they've got it
wrong

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know we got we got
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
we we heard from other states that that
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's not what happened
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
all right and then i noticed that
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh your next speaker has an answer yeah
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
is there are there any questions for
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative abram who wants to get
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that this is reducing
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
child support the way i read things and
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
how that makes sense and is helpful to
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
the children
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
no but well
 
00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
no but well
it

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
it reallocates how the child support is
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
given to each parent
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
then this bill doesn't impact that it's
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
about the joint parenting and the amount
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
of time that each each parent has the
 
00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:02.630 align:start position:0%
of time that each each parent has the
child

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
ms town will can explain that uh better
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
than i can again so if if i if i hear
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
that right and check my interpretation
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
that in the the joint parenting scenario
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of the child support will
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
stay the same this formula just
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
clarifies which parents should be paying
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
how much of that same total exactly all
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh representative did
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
you have a question and representative
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
abram can decide if he wants to field it
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to follow that oh
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
the conversation and
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
if my so it will reduce
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
or it has the potential to reduce
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
the um child support for one parent
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'd rather have
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
it better that she answered the question
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
because she knows this inside and out
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to give the wrong
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
answer okay okay
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
and plus they're holding they're waiting
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
for me and they were dealing with the
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill right now
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
i don't want to keep you from your pot
 
00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:05.109 align:start position:0%
i don't want to keep you from your pot
so

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
well you're you thank you so much for

here
there

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%

been working on some family court issues
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
for the past couple years we need you to
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
start by an introduction the careful
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
slow spelling of your last name and the
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
organization you represent
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
so my name is brenda towne t-o-w-n-e
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i am just a concerned parent

and i am just a concerned parent
grandparent

grandparent
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
historically i led a 5 000 person
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
parents group here in new hampshire
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
and today i am following through with
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
some of my commitments to those folks
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
that we would try to remedy
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges in family court
 
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges in family court
so

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the gentleman's name
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
my name is michael last name is dinan
 
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
my name is michael last name is dinan
d-i-n-a-n

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
dynan

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
dynan
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm a father of two young ladies uh
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
from the portsmouth area
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
so so you're not representing an
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
organization i am not i'm all right very
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
good we're happy to hear what
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
you have to say in this town
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm going to give
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of history because i
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
think that will level set why we're here
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
so back in 2015
 
00:55:51.119 --> 00:55:51.990 align:start position:0%
so back in 2015
the

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislator her legislature heard a bill
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
to move new hampshire to the vermont
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
calculations which are embedded in this
 
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.789 align:start position:0%
calculations which are embedded in this
bill

00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
it was decided at that point in time in
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
2016 to change that bill effort for the
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
using the cars to evaluate the practices
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
nations over the course of their work
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
they interviewed judges
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
lawyers dhhs
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
and gals and then they went through
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
court records through our own
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
courthouses to identify
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
what was happening what they found is
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
that in 80 sorry 80 percent of modified
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
child support orders they were modified
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
because of shared parenting time
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
so the judges
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
along with judge ashley who is
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
interviewed personally by me and also by
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative berrion
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
also came through with a very similar
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that was for
 
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that was for
standardized

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
child support calculations to limit the
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
amount of litigation
 
00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.910 align:start position:0%
amount of litigation
between

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
parents because this would be calculated
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
and easy for them to follow as well as
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
it stopped the arbitrage between judges
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
because they're fun they were finding it
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to get consistent judgments
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
across the different
 
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.030 align:start position:0%
across the different
courthouses

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
courthouses
 
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.109 align:start position:0%
courthouses
in

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
2019 um so in 2018 this report was
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
complete and it was presented to the
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
child and family law during that time
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and in that court in that report there
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
were multiple recommendations that this
 
00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:40.470 align:start position:0%
were multiple recommendations that this
bill

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
is a reflection of
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
now simultaneously the state of new
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire had litigation at the supreme
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
court level in a case called silva v
 
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.630 align:start position:0%
court level in a case called silva v
silva

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
silva
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of silva v silva in 2019 our
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted using the webster's
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
definition of fixed cost our current
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
rsas and in their judgment they made it
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
impossible to change a child support
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
order based on parenting time
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of fixed costs that
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
the higher earner would have to reduce
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
the fixed cost such as mortgage payments
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
of the other parent so since that point
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
in time new hampshire
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
judges have had their hands tied in
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
modifying child support to support
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
parents who manage their children
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
equally or near equally across
 
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.950 align:start position:0%
equally or near equally across
households

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
households
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.750 align:start position:0%
households
now

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.789 align:start position:0%
now
pat

00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
pat
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative abrami did mention
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
anderson v anderson because that did
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
follow soon thereafter our own legislate
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
our own supreme court kicked this back
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
and said guys we need a law on how to
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
split child support because there is
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
none on the books
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that is what has led us here the
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
kharsi report again all of that
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
investment of time and effort brought
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
forward these recommendations and again
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
included the input of our dhhs as well
 
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.230 align:start position:0%
included the input of our dhhs as well
as

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
our our bar association members
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
so we also have
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
now your fiscal note concerns and so i
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to address those in my feedback
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
so as pat mentioned the first issue was
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
that reserve
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the reserve of a parent who has to pay
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
child support today in the state of new
 
00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:31.510 align:start position:0%
child support today in the state of new
hampshire

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay while you're in there on the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
reserve i i don't know what that is i
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't we don't handle this so if you
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
could i'll explain it to you so what
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
happens is when a parent comes in and
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're a low-income earner the
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
child support calculation says you know
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're only making income to a
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifteen percent of poverty
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
line so again in our fiscal notes it's
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
like about fourteen thousand five
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
hundred a year
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
the currency school looked at that and
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
when they uh did our evaluation
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
they recognized that that reserve was
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
too low they wanted to raise it and what
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
that reserve does is if a parent makes
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
that number or less they pay 50 a month
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
in child support because they can't
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
support themselves
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
so what we're recommending just
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
identical to what carsey did is that we
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
need that one parent to have their
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
income raised to 120
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
of poverty in order to be able to pay
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
their fifty dollars a month in child
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
support if they're making you know that
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money otherwise they fall into
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
a condition where they would allocate
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
child support in our standard
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
how do we raise that income to the
 
01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.230 align:start position:0%
how do we raise that income to the
parent

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
well i'd love to just go to a different
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
group of parents well what we're doing
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
is we're comparing it to what they're
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
submitting on their financial affidavits
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
so whatever that parent is making that's
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
used as the basis for calculating what
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
the child support would be and so if
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
they make under that 120 percent of
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
poverty line
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
which is what's in this bill
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
versus the hundred and fifteen percent
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we've had historically they would
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
pay fifty dollars a month in child
 
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
pay fifty dollars a month in child
support

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
no they have to pay 50 a month in child
 
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:32.150 align:start position:0%
no they have to pay 50 a month in child
support

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
no what we want to do is we want to
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
raise that number so that it would be
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
120 percent of the poverty line and then
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
that rule would apply to those people
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
they would pay 50 a month instead of
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
being allocated a percent so
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
for example if you have one child in the
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and you're a
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
higher earner you typically pay about 22
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
of your income in child support so this
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
protects the people that make less than
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
120 of the poverty line that they would
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
only pay 50 a month instead of having
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
that percentage allocated against their
 
01:02:08.319 --> 01:02:10.630 align:start position:0%
that percentage allocated against their
income

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
mr dinan did you have something to add
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
to all that
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
in that one portion of it yes i mean
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
that requires that still a minimum of
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars would be paid i i think
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
this is a small part of it and it's
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
because this is one of the financial
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that regards the finance
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
through three committee the other one is
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
the impact to the courts and that's i
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
will let you start on that first yeah
 
01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:33.109 align:start position:0%
will let you start on that first yeah
because

01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that 50 would be a minimum required
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
of anyone not making up to 120 of the
 
01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:40.230 align:start position:0%
of anyone not making up to 120 of the
uh

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.029 align:start position:0%
uh
well

01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead wait wait a second
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative i just like to correct
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
the record here as amended it's 150
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
percent not 120 so just
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
we should be using accurate numbers
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry i have the um methodology of
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
the original bill here in front of me
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
and it's 120 it went from 150 the bill
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
was amended so so could you i this is an
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
important point would you just stick our
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
nose on the page and line number you're
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
there's an amended
 
01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
there's an amended
um

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find it here there's an
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
amended fiscal motive i'm not mistaken
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
there's there is an amended fiscal note
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh which you should all have dated march
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
15th if you're looking at the bill
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
itself on page 3 line 13
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the uh earlier okay
 
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.150 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the uh earlier okay
references

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
references
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
the earlier references when you
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned 120
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
would you agree that you meant to say
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
150 yes i didn't realize the amendment
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
had hit but yeah so the person's making
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a year
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
is what the the fiscal note shows okay
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand eight forty two thank
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
you for the catch there representative
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
and just so we understand this what that
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
means is anybody who makes that much or
 
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.789 align:start position:0%
means is anybody who makes that much or
less

01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
pays a fixed a small fixed amount
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
fixed amount that's the 50
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
as opposed to looking at the tables
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
which are also included in the bill
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
which determine percentages based on
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
income that you pay as your portion of
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
so essentially it decreases
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
the required child support of that
 
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.990 align:start position:0%
the required child support of that
parent

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
so i i i wanted to let you finish before
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
we we went into all the questions
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
do you feel like you're ready i i i
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
think there's three sections that you
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
want to address in here but i don't i
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
think it is prudent to answer as we go
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
through if there's questions on the
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
three different independents
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
so in reality we're talking not raising
 
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
so in reality we're talking not raising
the

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
income of a parent that's not making
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
much but with going to a different
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
criteria which may let that parent out
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
if that parent's making 115 120
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
they're not paying anything
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying 50 dollars they're paying
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
50 until they get down to what
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
so that so anything under that threshold
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
they're paying 50 a month even if
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
they're making 200 bucks a month right
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay i guess that's not the way i
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
understood from where you thank you
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right i i have some clarifying
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions but is are there any other
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
questions at this point
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately this first time i've ever
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
had to deal with child support issues
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
god bless you uh
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
i started i'll get back to you um
 
01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
i started i'll get back to you um
so

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the two big things in my head going into
 
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.589 align:start position:0%
the two big things in my head going into
this

01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:39.190 align:start position:0%
this
is

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
what is the impact on the total amount
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
of child support that gets paid to take
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
care of the child it does it go up stay
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
the same or go down it sounds like it it
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
may go down under some scenarios of
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
joint parenting i i want you to clarify
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
that and then the other part while
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking to that though is
 
01:05:57.839 --> 01:05:59.750 align:start position:0%
you're talking to that though is
connected

01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
connected
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
is is what happens
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the state's obligations
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
do does the amount that the state
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
contributes in
 
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
contributes in
uh

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
tanf or anything else does that is that
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
is that affected by this bill and if so
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll start by get walking
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
through the calculation so that we can
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
level set
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it considers
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that parents are parenting
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
their kids in two separate households
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
with nearly equivalent parenting time
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so because of that the expenses of
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
having two households are actually
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
higher so what it does is it raises up
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
the total
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
costs because you've got two households
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then what it does is it allocates
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
based on income the percentage of that
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
obligation how it would fall into each
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
obligation how it would fall into each
house

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
and then it gives a credit for the
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time that you're parenting
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
your children
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
so you raise the overall
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
cost profile recognizing that there's
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
two households
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then if parent number one has forty
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the time and the other parent
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
has sixty percent
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
um if they were making exactly the same
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
amount of income you know a credit of
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
only 40 of the parenting time would be
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
given to one parent and they would pay
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
the incremental 20 to the other parent
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference and then it
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
also as i said considers income
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
variability the income would be leveled
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
between households
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's a great explanation and then
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
could we just get like yes or no
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
is the amount that the state pays
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
affected at all by the way these
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
calculations take place well i would
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
tell you that the what would affect the
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
state would be the matching federal
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
funds for title 4-d
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
today new hampshire is the third highest
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
child support ordered
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
state in the country
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
by almost
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
40 percent over the median and that has
 
01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:01.750 align:start position:0%
40 percent over the median and that has
occurred

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
especially over the past few years with
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
our court's inability to
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
allocate parenting time as a factor in
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
determining the child support order
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
so in effect our overall child support
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
orders will decline because now we're
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
righting a wrong all right
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that the matching funds from the
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
federal government may in fact decline
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
in our title for dematching
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be cleared those are
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
only funds that go through the state i'm
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
sorry yes those are only for funds paid
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
from the higher earner to the lower
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
earner that go through the state the
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
majority of the funds that are paid and
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
which would all of them would be
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
affected by this are paid directly such
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
as i don't pay to the states the title
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
4d doesn't benefit or not benefit from
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
from what i pay that is only for
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
payments that go through the state yes
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to make a quick point
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
about this what happened with silva v
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
silva and i've it's taken me about three
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
years to get understanding of this
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
because i've suffered it myself and
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
lived this every day
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
is that the higher earner pays the lower
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
earner the total amount of funds that
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
would have been available
 
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
would have been available
for

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be shared across two households you
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
can use the word spread across two
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
households but what silva b silva did
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
because of the fixed cost issue and then
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
also another thing when this went to the
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
supreme court is it said um
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
equal or approximately equal parenting
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
time is not a grounds for an adjustment
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
so what that did we all heard anderson v
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
anderson that statement and what the
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
judge said in anderson v anderson he
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
said it's not my job to make the laws i
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
enforce them go to your legislatures and
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
in fact he said that go to your
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
legislature so we now have the third
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
highest amount of child support paid in
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
the country we were a national parenting
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
organization gave us an f
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
um and it's because we don't have the
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
offset method we most states vermont
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
what 1467 would do excuse me 1647 would
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
do is allow the higher earner to pay the
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
lower the lower earner pays the higher
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
basically the delta between the two
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
currently in in which is very clear to
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
me understanding about this
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change the amount of
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
funds paid it's going to
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
change how they're allocated so
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently because of silva v silva all
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
the funds from the higher earner are
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
paid to the lower earner in any
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
situation if the lower earner makes just
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
a dollar annual income or a dollar less
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
than the higher earner all those funds
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
go to the low earner if someone made
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars and the higher
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
owner makes
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand in one dollar all of
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
those funds go to the lower earner
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of parenting time and this is
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
the biggest sticking point because the
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
precedent that was set by silva v silva
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
and what we're addressing is the
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
incremental financial impacts of this
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't change the amount of
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
funds available it's actually going to
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
make clear guidelines so this litigious
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
nature every time anyone goes into a
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
family court it's the wild west you
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
never know what's going to happen
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
1647 would establish clear guidelines
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
for how those funds are are allocated it
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
would reduce our costs we are the most
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
litigious in the parenting organization
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
just to read from what they say just so
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
you can hear it because it's it's it's
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
well said
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of only nine states
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
lacking a presumptive parenting time
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment formula meaning based on how
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
much parenting time the children spend
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
with each parent instead it relies on
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily costly lengthy court
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
deviation procedures generally
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to lower income parents
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
meaning people don't have enough funds
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
to even fight this on both sides the
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
higher and the lower the lack of a
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
presumptive parenting time allocation an
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
integral component of mandated
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
presumptive child support arguably
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
violates federal regulatory requirements
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
and um
uh

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
basically saying this is the most
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
litigious nature of the law
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
and what this 1647 would do is just
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
simply say when some based on the
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
parenting time that's what you're paying
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
there will be i think some testimony
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
today about people talking about well
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
allocating you know attaching funds the
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
amount of parenting time will create
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
abusers to abuse their victims to hold
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
them somehow hostage
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
the parenting time is established it's
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
called a parenting petition i deal with
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
this every day the parenting decision is
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
is is agreed upon separately and in
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
advance of any kind of child funds as
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
they're allocated by the judge because
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
the uniform support order is what's
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
called the uso is what the the judge
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
hands you when you find out what you'll
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
be paying or receiving
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
so the parenting time is not in any way
 
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:40.950 align:start position:0%
so the parenting time is not in any way
that

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
associated with or based on the amount
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
of time you have the that you have the
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
children so when another you know group
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
may get up today and say well this will
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
allow abusers to abuse their children it
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
is not in my case i have them more than
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
55 of the time but i'm left with
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
zero amount of funds that would have
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
been allocated on this per our child
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
support guidelines because of silva v
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
silva and we also in advance of that
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're already that one of the highest
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
paying states in the in the country 2014
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
we got a c by the parenting organization
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we got an f because we're the
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
third highest as in failure and this is
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
the nature of what we're discussing the
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
impact of the court the finance but the
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
details of what
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
relates to the finance committee
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
court costs would go down people's
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
parenting time would be
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
clear the funds would be clear there
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as much litigious nature and
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
also the the child support reserve is is
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
a little tricky one but that basically
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
means that someone's going to pay 50 a
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
month regardless of what they're earning
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
but again that has to be the higher
 
01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.830 align:start position:0%
but again that has to be the higher
earner

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
earner
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's another bill out there right now
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
that talks between 50 and 60. you know
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's only 10 percent that the other
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill would apply to because you have to
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
be the higher earner you have to be the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
51 percent of the income to be the
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
higher earner so between 50 and 60 is
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
the only area you get it
 
01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:00.630 align:start position:0%
the only area you get it
1647

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
1647
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
it replicates all the other states it
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
does what is successful it is clear the
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
interest of acting up that our courts
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
are somehow going to be impacted or this
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
abusers you know kind of
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
holding their their the victims hostage
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
is just i don't know why anyone would
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
say that because everyone knows it's
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
agreed to by every parenting
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
organization the cars he studied the
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
dartmouth study this national npo is
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that children do best when they're with
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
both parents that's been made clear why
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
would there be any other interest in
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
expressing otherwise so so a question
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
for representative weber
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's really a question of you because
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a visitor here and a a ringer today
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm very uncomfortable because it
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
seems like what we're having is a whole
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
nother hearing on the policy underlying
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill which has already been decided
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and i
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
say that is somebody who has actually
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
practiced law in this area back in the
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
late stone age in vermont
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
when we did in fact allocate between the
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
two parents based not only on the
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
differential between incomes but the
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
differential between time
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
spent and it wasn't who had control it
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
was the time spent
 
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.070 align:start position:0%
was the time spent
i

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
have opinions about this bill but i
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
think i ought to defer to the policy
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee on the policy of the bill
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
because they heard everybody speak not
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
just one set of people
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i truly think we ought to confine
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves here
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
solely to the question of
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i think is this going to change court
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
costs in any way is very valid for this
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee i also think
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
the question of whether this is going to
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
have any impact whatsoever
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
on state
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
obligations for payment for kids
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
whose needs are not being met
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
under whatever the scheme is that we
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
come up because that's that those are
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm very uncomfortable with this
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
whole re-examination of the policy
 
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
whole re-examination of the policy
behind

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
behind something which has been
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
considered by the children and family
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
law committee
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
and and where decisions have been made
 
01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:28.950 align:start position:0%
and and where decisions have been made
already

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i i i
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a visitor here so i don't know the
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
reasons for this but
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
it it seems peculiar to me so i just
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that as a concern thank
 
01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that as a concern thank
you

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're welcome and if you get to
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
the point where you're just really
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to a point where you can't
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
bear it any longer
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
you can excuse yourself
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
um but the reason i'm never going to get
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
please don't interrupt
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
i didn't interrupt you
 
01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
i didn't interrupt you
um

01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
the reason we're listening to this is
 
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.189 align:start position:0%
the reason we're listening to this is
twofold

01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
twofold
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
one the sponsor of the bill asked us to
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
to hear from ms toll and i invited mr
 
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
to hear from ms toll and i invited mr
denham

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
denham
 
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.910 align:start position:0%
denham
up

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
when when i'm casting a vote
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.590 align:start position:0%
relative to
money

01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
i want to understand the mechanics of
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on underneath it so that
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
when we do talk about the money piece i
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it makes sense given
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
what i understand about the underlying
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
policy so
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
i i have no issue with us getting
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
smarter before we vote i think
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
intelligent voting is better
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
than not having the information so
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
at this point i've tried to be courteous
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
to ms toll and mr denham to let them say
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
what they wanted to say because it was
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
all educational
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
but i i asked two questions earlier does
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
this reduce the amount of money for the
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
kid and i think i heard no it doesn't it
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
just shifts the percentages and two
 
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
just shifts the percentages and two
because

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're proposing a formula in this
 
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.350 align:start position:0%
we're proposing a formula in this
bill

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
it should make it much more easier for
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
the family courts to assess
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
who pays how much in a joint custody
 
01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:20.470 align:start position:0%
who pays how much in a joint custody
situation

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and to me
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
the logic of that suggests
 
01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:25.110 align:start position:0%
the logic of that suggests
that

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state costs could be reduced because
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's going to be less
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
fighting over an arbitrary amount of
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
money being uh selected and so
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
so knowing what i know from the
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm i'm now kind of confident
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
that i disagree with the fiscal note
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal note said that it's
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to result in additional litigation
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
and because we've been made smarter i
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that's true
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your comment um
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
i i i just think it's in everyone's
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
interests to include the public that
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
when we make a decision about money
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it in isolation so that
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm coming from uh uh
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
mr dinan since you've revealed that you
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
have 55 parenting
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
how is the money split and what will
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
this bill change currently all the funds
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
that were allocated so in to use
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat hypothetical numbers
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
we were assigned uh about 26 of both for
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
income because 22 for one child 26 of
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
our income when you have two children so
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's 26 percent of my income before
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
taxes it would be 26 percent of my uh
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
my i don't want to call her ex but my
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
children's mother um
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
would be paying 26 as well those are
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
combined and they should have been split
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
currently all those
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
100 of those funds go to her the lower
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
earner what this would do is based on
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
parenting time it would give me a credit
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
is the term that the the law uses 1647
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
uses and brendan uses but basically
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
would say they're with me 50 of the time
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
so thus 50 of that those funds should be
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
with me currently i can't pay for camps
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
i can't pay for clothing there's another
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
law called co-dare if one parent has all
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
the funds the other parent i can't make
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
that person do anything you know there's
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
no way it means of me telling them how
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
to spend their money so currently if the
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
children don't have clothing or they
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
can't go to a camp i have no input on
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
that that's where this becomes a real
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem it's one parent
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
get makes all the parenting decisions
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
that will come down to how they're given
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses how they get car
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
insurance how they get a cellular
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
telephone television school books so all
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
those funds to answer your question i
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
apologize for carrying on would be split
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
between two households and it wouldn't
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
be based on 55 it would still be 50 50.
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
because now you're giving all you're
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
giving all the money to the other one
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
parent the lord
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
the low earner doesn't matter if that
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
person makes a dollar less than the high
 
01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:02.629 align:start position:0%
person makes a dollar less than the high
owner

01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
all the funds per soba be silva go and
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
this is where i don't think a lot of
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
people understand how it really works
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
and the family in law did speak on this
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
as well that the family law committee
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
children family law committee especially
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
kim rice in the legislature it was her
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
the testament was her own it did pass
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
and there is another bill that's out
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
there called sb 431 i don't want to
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
confuse our discussions it's a senate
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
bill that suffered the same scrutiny
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
what this law would do
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
is simply provide
 
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
is simply provide
the

01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
the people that may speak against the
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
spills it actually provides real bumpers
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
it provides a real road that everyone
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
can drive down and get to the same
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
destination with clear prescribed
 
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
destination with clear prescribed
numbers

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
the current silva v silva and the other
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
opposing bill turns everything to the
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
wild west it would say that
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
they would not give any relief to the to
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
the higher earner so currently i have no
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
input on how any of the funds are spent
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is the same with all
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
parents and believe me there's moms that
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
are the higher earners and the the lower
 
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
are the higher earners and the the lower
earning

01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
earning
 
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.229 align:start position:0%
earning
dads

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
dads
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
they don't really their their effort is
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
to stay underemployed it really creates
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
a scenario where
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
if you're the lower earner you have to
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
protect your
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
making less than 50
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the total and you'll do a lot of
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
things to do that and i'm not going to
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
go into details of my personal situation
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
but it promotes less funds being
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
available for both children that's what
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
the current law would do that's what sb
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
431 would do
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
14 16 16 excuse me 1647 is the what
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
every other state uses it's called the
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
offset method we're actually in
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law currently
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's what's being told and i think the
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
discussions on you know
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is a financial discussion i'm just
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
giving you more education a little bit
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
of details but what's being talked about
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
is that the the actual
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
things that i mentioned the parenting
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
time being associated with somehow
 
01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
time being associated with somehow
abusers

01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
abusers
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's a again it's done before the
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
parenting position petition where we
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
have 50 50 and this is want to be clear
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
about my answer it wouldn't change based
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day i had i have four hours
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
more this week so that's gives me
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
another percent it's 50 50. it's in our
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
parenting petition it's a parenting plan
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
signed off by all parties the judge both
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
parents and that's established then
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
after that the uniform support order the
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
uso is established so there's no there's
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
no way that the two can can overlap or
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
intercede and this is what needs to be
 
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.470 align:start position:0%
intercede and this is what needs to be
understood

01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
the court's right let's say we
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
understand that all right all right uh
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a follow-up
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you for increasing my
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
understanding it doesn't seem fair the
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
way it is presently thank you it's not
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
just unfair it it's
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
our children are suffering because of it
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
i have no input on how any of the funds
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
are spent and this is what's interesting
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
about any party that speaks against this
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
law what is their interest in saying
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
that that both parents
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have say on how the funds are
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
spent for the best interests of their
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
children how could that be and it that
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
would go against what every
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
the dartmouth school the carthy school
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
the npo why would anyone say this well
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm finding out because i don't like
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories but a lot of the
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
groups that are speaking against this
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill are actually funded by our
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
association please let's just wait to
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
hear from them without you impugning
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
anything all right
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
so representative walner
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
i i was wondering it is the question of
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
you mr chair whether or not there's
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone from the department that's going
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
to speak on this i i'm
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
interested to see what the financial
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is and how it affects the
 
01:24:36.159 --> 01:24:37.189 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is and how it affects the
state

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i was going to
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
ask when they're through if there's
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else that would like to testify
 
01:24:42.719 --> 01:24:44.709 align:start position:0%
anyone else that would like to testify
so

01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
do you miss towns you have
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
i did want to answer a question that you
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
had asked pat abrami
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and that was
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
because of the judicial note saying that
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
this would cause
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
court costs to rise
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to address that because
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
what that isn't referring to
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
is that since 2019
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
all of the court orders that have been
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
issued for child support for shared
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
parenting have been done under the
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
umbrella of silva v silva so we have
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of families out there who have
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
had poor child support orders issued
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
where one household is hamstrung
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
compared to the other and if this law is
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
addressed it will probably need some um
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be a wave of parents coming in
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
looking for to be addressed
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay just to make sure i'm hearing you
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
that there's probably a two or three
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
year backlog of these joint custody
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
orders that are going to have to be
 
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.709 align:start position:0%
orders that are going to have to be
resolved

01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
using this formula and therefore in the
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
short term there could be a higher
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
judicial expense but the expectation is
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
once we hit stable state we're probably
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
going to have a lower number uh going
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
forward is it is that fair that's very
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
fair i just didn't want to leave that
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
open because there is some truth to the
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
fact that there are folks out there who
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
are going to want to have their
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
i really truly appreciate your
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
clarification that was very helpful
 
01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.629 align:start position:0%
clarification that was very helpful
representative

01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
representative
weber

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
that was exactly the question i had so
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
she has answered it thank you
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's being designed in that
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
the use of mark oh yes sir and the
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
reason we do that is because it's being
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
broadcast and recorded so we want to
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
make sure we hear you we're on tv right
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
now uh yes
 
01:26:27.199 --> 01:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
now uh yes
um

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's done nothing for my celebrity so
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't don't get too nervous
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to delete your celebrity
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes um so the
 
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.709 align:start position:0%
yes um so the
the

01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
time that every three years uh these
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
child support orders uh the parenting
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
petition is reevaluated automatically
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
every three years what i think 1647
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
would do is be wrapped into that that
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
rotation so when someone's up for the
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
next three years it actually would help
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
reduce those costs even further because
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen anyway people
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
already get their hearing it should be
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay i do have an in the weeds question
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh it does
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good reasons to pass
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
this lots of good reasons i just want to
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
know if
 
01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
know if
mechanically

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
mechanically
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've we're going to insert a perverse
 
01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
we've we're going to insert a perverse
incentive

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
for one parent or another to increase
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
their fixed costs in the amount that
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
they pay for mortgages
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
and the on the other hand sometimes they
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
can't help it their rents got raised and
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
so so how does that changing of the
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
fixed cost
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
get factored in over time so the child
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
support calculation is a percentage of
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
overall income and so our rsas on child
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
support allow deviation from the
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
standard calculation if there are
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary expenses like let's say
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
the children are going to private school
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a funding that needs to be
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
funded by both parents so there's
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's other ways that judges can
 
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
there's other ways that judges can
modify

01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
modify
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
outside of income and parenting time to
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
right the ship but overall a standard
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
child support calculation starts with
 
01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
child support calculation starts with
income

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then child care expenses life and
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
sorry health insurance those are the
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
really the key factors that are at the
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
standard for calculating child support
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then as i said our child support
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
laws allow for extraneous things to be
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated by a judge and balance out the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
books okay earlier i could have sworn i
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
heard you mentioned mortgages as one of
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
the major components of the fixed cost
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
calculation did i mishear you that was
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
in relationship to silva v silva so when
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
the judgment was made interpreting our
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
current rsas the way that they're
 
01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:39.910 align:start position:0%
current rsas the way that they're
drafted

01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.709 align:start position:0%
drafted
they

01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
use the term fixed costs and so it
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
narrowed the ability of anybody to be
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
able to get an adjustment for parenting
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
time based on that
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that clarification are
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
there other questions for these panel
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
members uh representative irv just one
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
question so i get the
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
situation with the
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
incomes roughly equal or even you know
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
close to equal that makes a lot of sense
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
to me i understand why that wants to be
 
01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.110 align:start position:0%
to me i understand why that wants to be
changed

01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
what will be the impact on the situation
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
with just the other extreme very low
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
earner very high earner
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
so you'll you'll see um again the total
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
child support order um very similar to
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
is what you would see today but they're
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to increase it by 50
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the households have
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
twice the costs
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
and then the higher earners percentage
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
of child support dollars will go
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the other parent
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
for to make up the income difference um
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
in order to compensate for two very
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
diverse economic households the child
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
support credit uh will be given on
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
parenting time but it will be at that
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
lesser dollar amount
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the calculation um
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
allows for that equalizing of of the
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
households so that both households have
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for these two
 
01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.229 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for these two

oh you're pointing to me oh yeah yeah

thank you yeah
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i also have a handout if i can just
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman my name is
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
richard head i'm the government affairs
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch and
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to switch seats because i'm
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
getting blocked here
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
1d or 2ds
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh 1d
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the former representative
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
who couldn't spell his name and put two
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things i just wanted
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
to point out on behalf of the judicial
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
branch one with regard to the policy of
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
using parenting time relative to
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
calculating child support we have no
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
position on that that is not
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
an issue that that i'm here to address
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
i did want to talk about our uh fiscal
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
note and the timing of what our fiscal
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
note was prepared which was on the
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
original bill and what is printed in
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
here is based on the the original bill
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
not on the amended bill we have not been
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
asked for an updated fiscal note
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
so this is based on on the original
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
one thing to also know is that the
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
original bill did not have
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
section seven which is in the current
 
01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
section seven which is in the current
bill

01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
and and that section seven was added at
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
our request during the hearing in
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay pause so that those who don't speak
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
in section numbers yep i can uh page 4
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is an applicability clause
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay i see it now just give a second to
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you what were you going to
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
say then so the applicability clause
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
refers to what you heard about in the
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
prior testimony which is on a three-year
 
01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.550 align:start position:0%
prior testimony which is on a three-year
cycle

01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
child support orders are reviewed on a
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
as a matter of routine
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
that natural three-year cycle did not
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
apply and it would have upon enactment
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
applied to all
 
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
applied to all
orders

01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
those that had been previously issued
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
and going forward all on the same day
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
all at the same time would have created
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
in our mind a rush to the courthouse
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that would have created substantial
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
burden on the courts at that moment of
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
effective date that has been addressed
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
by the children of family law
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
through this paragraph uh in section 7
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
on page 4 line 25 so we appreciate that
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
that was at our request and they and
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
they did do that
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
so finish the thought what how would
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
that uh modify your fiscal note it would
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
modify it in the sense that it would
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
single point
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
of load and spread it out over time and
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
that obviously reduces the
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
impact on a particular day it doesn't
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
mean that there won't be the same number
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
of orders that need to be modified it
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
just it smooths it out in a way that is
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the court staff court
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
judicial resources
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
be able to manage that load over time as
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to on a on a point day
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
so do you think that's a substantive
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
enough modification that we should uh
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
ask for an updated fiscal note so that
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
if this goes to the senate they've
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
they've got the best and latest version
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
i do and also for the second point that
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
i want to address which is the handout i
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
think would also be useful if it was
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the into the
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch's fiscal note i will say
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
all of that is going to lead to a
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion that it's indeterminable
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
because we can't predict today
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what that load is going to be
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
but there are elements
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the way that the amendment was
 
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
in the way that the amendment was
drafted

01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:35:07.119 --> 01:35:08.149 align:start position:0%
drafted
and

01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
the beneficial
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
aspects of this new section 7 that would
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
be reflected in our fiscal note
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh in in anticipation of the question
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
would you be able to guess at um a good
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
guess at the quantity of
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
cases that might be in the backlog that
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
would need to be reviewed are we talking
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
about just an order of magnitude are we
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking a thousand five thousand i have
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
no clue what the quantity is a fair
 
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.390 align:start position:0%
no clue what the quantity is a fair
question

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
as to the precision no but generally
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is that in if we're
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
talking domestic matters generally we're
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
talking about 6 000 filings a year
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
breaking that down into cases that have
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
child support orders
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
parenting plans becomes much more
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
complicated and i don't have a reduction
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
to that level of specificity but when
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking domestic orders we're in
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of 6 000 per year of new
 
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of 6 000 per year of new
cases

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then so those cases that have
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
parenting plans and in child support
 
01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.709 align:start position:0%
parenting plans and in child support
orders

01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be under the new system and then
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
those that have been previously issued
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
would get filtered through on a
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that's a beneficial aspect of it in
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
the handout
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this amendment
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
does that was not in the original bill
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
that we have to take into account from
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
the court's perspective in
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
how does it get implemented because we
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
are talking about a
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh a group of litigants that are
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
primarily unrepresented by legal counsel
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
so the simpler the better from the
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
court's perspective because
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
as it becomes more complicated they're
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
more questions to clerk staff and this
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
is really a clerk staff issue
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
not a judge issue so much but clerks are
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
are are really the front line of
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
confused litigants
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
who are approaching
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
so let's put a pin in that is it your
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
position that this is sufficiently
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
simple enough or do you think this is
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
overly complex still this is a very
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
complex bill um as as amended because
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll walk you through why i think
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
that and you may disagree with me but i
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
want to give you the specific reasons so
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
the preview of coming attractions though
 
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.629 align:start position:0%
the preview of coming attractions though
um

01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to make the case that this
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
is more complex
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
do you have an alternative that to
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
propose that would be simpler
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
i do not have language fair fair point i
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
do not have specific language it and and
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
in part let me give you a little more
 
01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.189 align:start position:0%
in part let me give you a little more
background

01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment was proposed in the
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee hearing so the hearing before
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
children and family law was not so much
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
about this amendment
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
as it was about the original bill which
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have sort of these complexities
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have the issues i think it
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then coming here today
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
my focus was less on sort of the policy
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
and what i was assuming at the end of
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
the day is you're probably going to tell
 
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
the day is you're probably going to tell
me

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
deal with it in the senate in the in the
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
policy committee um but if not i'm happy
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with it in the in this committee
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
i hadn't intended to do that um but i i
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think we're sort of getting into a
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of a blind alley on this if
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
your position is this is too complex but
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have an alternative today
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
it may be that you have to share that
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
alternative with the senate so that they
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
have something to compare and contrast
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it's a fair point um and i do think
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know some of the original language
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
it just had some simpler aspects to it
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
and i also think by the way that the
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill that's crossing over
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
does itself have some it tries to do
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
some of these things and that bill
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
actually does
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
have a somewhat simpler approach than
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
so it may just be at the end of the day
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how these two bills
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
which are sort of crossing over each
 
01:39:09.119 --> 01:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
which are sort of crossing over each
other

01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
can sort of get merged and i think
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
that's the context in which
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
the language will ultimately get worked
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
out is trying to figure out what's good
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
from from the senate bill what's good
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
from the house bill and trying to to
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
bring that to a consensus all right i i
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
understand that point what else would
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
you like to tell us so with regard to
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
just very briefly i did want to identify
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
where it is
that

01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
we as as a court system and our clerks
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
are going to have a great deal of
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
difficulty in terms of just processing
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
the litigants coming in to try to figure
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
this out like how does that apply to
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
them and i can be very brief about this
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
i i think the handout lays it out
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
but in the handout what what the handout
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
is is is essentially extracting out all
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the new definitions that are contained
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and tries to put it into a single
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
page because it's a they're all word
 
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
page because it's a they're all word
formulas

01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
formulas
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
so they say this minus this is this
 
01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:15.109 align:start position:0%
so they say this minus this is this
definition

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
and and one of the key ones is the new
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph which would be roman numeral
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
12 xii which is the definition of child
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
support obligation calculation
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that then feeds into really a number
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
of things one is it tells you who is the
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
obligor and who is the obligee simple
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
enough i have no issue with that
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
once you get into definitions that
 
01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.590 align:start position:0%
once you get into definitions that
require

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
a review of other definitions to figure
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
out what the count how to make the
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
calculation you're adding to complexity
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
in a pro se litigant's sort of capacity
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
to do these calculations and it's like
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
looking at a tax form you can say well
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
you convert it into a form all they have
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
to do is check it through
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
tax forms are essentially trying to
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
convert the tax code to a form and it
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
becomes very
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
complicated so if i look and i'll focus
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
on on roman
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
12 which says a parent's household
 
01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.470 align:start position:0%
12 which says a parent's household
responsibility

01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
minus the parent's financial
 
01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
minus the parent's financial
responsibility

01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
is the definition of child support
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
obligation calculation
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
and parental support is also defined as
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
what is the obligates child support
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
obligation calculation this is like the
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
essential calculation
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
within that the first part of it the
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
parent's household responsibility is
 
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
parent's household responsibility is
defined

01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
in the new paragraph 13
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
defined to say essentially the parent's
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
household responsibility percentage
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
which is another defined term
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
times the total support obligation which
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
is yet another defined term
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
so if we go
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
continuing sort of on this course of
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what these mean in
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph 11 13 the parents household
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities percentage is defined
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
by the new paragraph 14 none of these
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
were in the original bill
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
creates the first real substantive and
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
strong stumbling block because it
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
defines household responsibility
 
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.270 align:start position:0%
defines household responsibility
percentage

01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
as the percentage of household
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility designated in the
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
parenting plan where now by doing that
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
incorporating a different statute 461 a
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
which has no
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
term household responsibility and the
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
parenting plan as currently designed
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
does not come up with a percentage
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
figure so the parenting plan we have a
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
template based upon the statute 461a
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
what is required and this number just
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in that parenting plan so
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the courts are going to have to figure
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
out what that is
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
create a percentage that would come out
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
statute out of this new bill
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
and and we got to figure out is that the
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
same thing as residential responsibility
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
which is defined or is it something new
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
when we're talking household
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility because we're using
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
different words so i'm assuming it means
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
something different but truthfully i'm
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what it is we're going to
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to figure that out because it's
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguous that's where we sort of get
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
into this issue of how do we define
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
stuff in the court system we look at web
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
series we look at sort of the common and
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
ordinary meaning of stuff
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
that may have sort of kicked us in the
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
road of where we are today in terms of
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through each of
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
these but
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
these definitions all rely on other
 
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
these definitions all rely on other
definitions

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.430 align:start position:0%
definitions
that

01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
feed upon themselves and every time you
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
do that you add a little bit of
 
01:43:53.119 --> 01:43:54.470 align:start position:0%
do that you add a little bit of
ambiguity

01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then from the court's perspective
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
if you've ever tried to
 
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
if you've ever tried to
follow

01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
a definition by by having to read three
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
other definitions and plug it in it
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
becomes very complicated for a lay
 
01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:09.430 align:start position:0%
becomes very complicated for a lay
person

01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then our clerks have to help people
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
figure it out and it becomes
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
a burden on the courts as these become
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
more complicated my only message and i
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
do think it's something that is is
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
better addressed in
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably in the in the policy committee
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
mostly in part because of time here in
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
getting the parties who are who are
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
interested in this together but i do
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
figuring out of what works in the senate
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill what works and how spill
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and putting them together and i
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
think it's going to
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
be a process
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
are you able to pause there yeah uh
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative walner i'm i'm curious on
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
on your opinion on this
 
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
on your opinion on this
um

01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
given given that we're looking at the
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
worksheet that's been advanced and and
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
we understand now that it this worksheet
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh flows from the language of the bill
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
let's let's just assume for the purpose
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
of this question
 
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.830 align:start position:0%
of this question
that

01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.709 align:start position:0%
that
this

01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
worksheet is more complex than it needs
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the senate bill is likely to have
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
is do you think
 
01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:27.590 align:start position:0%
is do you think
our

01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
our
opinion

01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
our division iii our opinion
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
is is is relevant to whether or not we
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
like this worksheet and what we do with
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
this bill based on whether or not we
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
like this worksheet
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what your thoughts are
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
i still reserve the right to disagree
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
well what i'm thinking is it seems like
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
this needs more time
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
than this division's got i mean i think
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
we have to report this
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
out by wednesday
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i feel like it's really
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
a pretty complex
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
issue here and we still have not heard
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
from the department which is what is
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
what i would like to hear is i want to
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
hear what this financially is going to
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
because it feels like to me at least
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
there are financial
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
issues here
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
some for the court certainly
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
but also in the area of tanf and some of
 
01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.629 align:start position:0%
but also in the area of tanf and some of
the

01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
programs that we are
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
most concerned about in this division
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
all right that that's that's good thank
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm going to consider this uh
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
handout this attachment as being
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
pertinent to our decision and i'm going
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
to assume that simple is better because
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
of all the
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
court time that could be taken by a more
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
complex form if it's too complex
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
so so that that gives me pause there
 
01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
so so that that gives me pause there
um

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
before i invite the department of health
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
and human services up i i don't want to
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh have you run out of time is there
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
anything else you you still want to tell
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
us you know i don't feel i'm not going
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
to go through the entire
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
handout i just gave has similar issues
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
throughout but i will be here as through
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the hearing if other
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions come up i'm happy to
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
participate thank you mr head thank you
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
is there somebody from the department
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
here to speak
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah oh wait a second did you have a
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's um more of sort of an observation
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
but i'll put it in the form of a
 
01:47:48.159 --> 01:47:49.910 align:start position:0%
but i'll put it in the form of a
question

01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
because i genuinely don't know the
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
answer to this but
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
mr head
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
in my experience in vermont a very long
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
this allocation was made so you're
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
adjusting not only based on
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
the amount that each parent earns but
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of time each child spends
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
with each parent
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
is there somewhere in the statute
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
a definition of what's going to be
 
01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
a definition of what's going to be
counted

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
counted
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much time
 
01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.229 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much time
because

01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
in vermont what happened back
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
sometime in the late stone age
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the litigation turned on
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
gee is it fair to count only where the
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
kid sleeps or is it
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
more important to look at the quality of
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
the time spent with each parent and
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
who's actually spending the money as
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to providing a bed at night
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
and might those questions
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
lead to more court time being needed
 
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
as we go through the rolling
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
calculations because
 
01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.629 align:start position:0%
calculations because
each

01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:49:10.639 --> 01:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
each
family's

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
family's
 
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
family's
actual

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
situation is different from most other
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
families and and might that be a source
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
of more court time
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
more court clerk time more judge time
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
rather than less so thank you for the
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
question and it does refresh my memory
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
because it's it's an uh a point i made
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
meant to make before when i was talking
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
about section seven
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think this this has
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
maybe competing more and less court time
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
issues which is one i do think
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
in part of the reason that the fiscal
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
note reflects what it does and would
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
remain the same
 
01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.229 align:start position:0%
remain the same
is

01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
in part you shift litigation
 
01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.350 align:start position:0%
in part you shift litigation
from

01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
child support calculations to parenting
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
time so so essentially you're shifting
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
litigation from this statute which is
 
01:50:08.199 --> 01:50:09.750 align:start position:0%
litigation from this statute which is
458c

01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
458c
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the statute dealing with parenting
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
time which is 461a
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.310 align:start position:0%
and and
um

01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
where we where we have parties who are
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
not reaching agreement throughout where
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have those in which
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
there is a litigious
 
01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.030 align:start position:0%
there is a litigious
couple

01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and therefore requiring the court to
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
be making decisions as opposed to
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
reaching agreement
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
the focus it's anticipated
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and and obviously time will tell it
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
is anticipated that
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
there will be a shift in litigation
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
focus from
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
to the parenting plan and to the
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's true of any of these bills but
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
once child support is more closely tied
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
to parenting time
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the litigation is going to
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
occur because it has
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
a direct
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
impact on child support and the
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
financial side of it so
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a wash or not or
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's more litigation i
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
but it would definitely be not
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
definitely i'm sorry
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
we assume there will be a shift in the
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
litigation towards the parenting plan
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and so really having that as was
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
said before that's determined earlier in
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
the process and in the litigation would
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
occur in in that in that context
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay that was that was good thank you um
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
so in my mind's eye
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
what would be the perfect test of
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
simplicity mr head i'm i'm sorry i had
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
this was for you
 
01:51:56.239 --> 01:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
this was for you
um

01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
in in in in
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
the the the best test for simplicity
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
if we took a
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
a couple that's in dispute over the
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
amount of child support they each have
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
it would be great if this form this
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
worksheet was so simple that the law was
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
so simple that you could take
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
two high school graduates
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know have them each independently
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
when they know enough of the court's
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
decision could sit down and fill this
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
out and share it with each other and
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
then they'd basically be the same number
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
is is that objective for simplicity
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
achievable in this environment or is is
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
that just wishing for something we we're
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
not going to get to anyways it's
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
probably not 100 achievable but it is
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
the aspirational goal
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
and and and if you were to sleep on this
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
for a week or two do you think you'd be
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a vision of that
 
01:52:54.239 --> 01:52:55.589 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a vision of that
aspiration

01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
aspiration
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
with input from others
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's good information thank you mr
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity uh to give us
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1647.

services through the bureau of child
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
support services administers the child
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
support program
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with the social security act
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%

and

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
the bureau has an interest in making
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
sure that the legislature is up to date
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the current status of our quadrennial
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
review the guidelines review that we are
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to complete
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
um at least once every four years we are
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
currently in a review year and our
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
quadrennial review is well underway
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
we anticipate to have a
 
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.430 align:start position:0%
we anticipate to have a
updated

01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
updated
 
01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.430 align:start position:0%
updated
report

01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
by the end of this calendar year
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
which we anticipate will certainly yield
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
some helpful recommendations for the
 
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.589 align:start position:0%
some helpful recommendations for the
legislature

01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
moving forward as the considerations of
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
these bills relative to the child
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
support guidelines calculations come
 
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
support guidelines calculations come
forward

01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
so certainly
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
want the legislature to be aware of that
 
01:55:10.159 --> 01:55:11.830 align:start position:0%
want the legislature to be aware of that
additionally

01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.350 align:start position:0%
additionally
as

01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
mentioned

01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fiscal impacts of this
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
bill that the department potentially
 
01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:26.229 align:start position:0%
bill that the department potentially
foresees

01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
foresees
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
certainly in the event that the
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
is increased that threshold is what we
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
use for the standard of minimal support
 
01:55:36.159 --> 01:55:37.589 align:start position:0%
use for the standard of minimal support
orders

01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
so there is the potential and certainly
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
an indeterminable amount
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
that we may see an increase in such
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
minimum orders which could we could
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
assume may have a corresponding increase
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
in families and children requiring
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
either additional or new public
 
01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.350 align:start position:0%
either additional or new public
assistance

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
or its other
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
financial assistance programs
 
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
financial assistance programs
and

01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
certainly we
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the event that the bill is passed we
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
might even see some indeterminable
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
costs to
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
if the child support guidelines are
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
changed there may be some costs
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
associated with changing our child
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
support guidelines worksheets and our
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
online calculator things from a
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
technology standpoint that we would have
 
01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:31.990 align:start position:0%
technology standpoint that we would have
to

01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.510 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
address and adopt so
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
so let me let me
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
pause you for a second
 
01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.430 align:start position:0%
pause you for a second
um

01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about this new
 
01:56:43.679 --> 01:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about this new
population

01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would go from the current uh
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
reserve number to the perspective
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
reserve number from 14 something to 15
 
01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.109 align:start position:0%
reserve number from 14 something to 15
something

01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
if they were just to go from the minimum
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the next minimum
 
01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.310 align:start position:0%
to the next minimum
um

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
how how much more would each of those
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
instances cost the state i know that
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
overall this is an indeterminable
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
problem but i'm just wondering if you
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
just take it down to the micro analysis
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
of one case if we've got a number to
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
throw at it so we have a point of
 
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:22.470 align:start position:0%
throw at it so we have a point of
reference

01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
well what i could say
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak to what the potential
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
costs would be certainly that would be
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
in unknown for us
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
but what i can say that currently in our
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
within the bureau of child support
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
services the orders
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the families in which we serve which
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
we serve both
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're a third party neutral
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
program we serve both parties
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
persons who are responsible to pay and
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
those who are responsible to receive
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
minimum orders for support in our
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
current caseload is roughly about an
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.599 --> 01:58:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
i i have to play this back to make sure
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing you uh so currently
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
eight percent of the total population
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's uh that would be affected by this
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
law eight percent are now
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
bouncing up against the the
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
the maximum reserve level
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
that they're within the maximum reserve
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
level now eight percent is that what
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
that eight percent number reflects i'm
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
sorry let me clarify the um
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child support services um
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
collects and enforce orders that we um
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
are enforcing currently eight percent of
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
our caseload of orders that we
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh collect and enforce on
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't include orders that are
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
represented outside of
 
01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.830 align:start position:0%
represented outside of
our

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:00.790 align:start position:0%
our
authority

01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
our current caseload consists of about
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right i'll just admit i don't
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
understand but uh as long as the rest of
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee does i'm i'm willing to move
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
on i think i can clarify uh the first
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
thing to know is that not every child
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
support order is
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
enforceable through the department
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
so there are plenty of people who have
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
child support so we don't have any
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
obviously any data about orders that we
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
don't enforce
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
in our case load which
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
over thirty thousand cases
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
eight percent of them are currently at
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
the fifty dollar a month minimum
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
so that means that
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
the parties with the children as opposed
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
to the party who's paying child support
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
would would be more at risk at needing
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
public assistance because of the low
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
amount of child support
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that eight percent would maybe move
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
to nine percent or
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
or some incremental
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
change it could um the other thing to
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
remember is that the the eight percent
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
number right now does include um
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
the obligors that we have that are in
 
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:15.189 align:start position:0%
the obligors that we have that are in
prison

02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
prison
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
and most of them have a minimum child
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
support order of 50.50 a month so
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're into slightly
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
different category slightly different
 
02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
different category slightly different
category

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
but okay so now i think i'm i'm still
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
wanting to know an answer to a question
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
you may not be prepared for and that is
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
let's say it goes from eight percent to
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
nine percent that incremental one
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
percentage point how much would a case
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
or that whole one percent how much more
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's possible to know that
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
dependent the the number with that deals
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
with the self-support reserve is all
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
based on the obligors income
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
um we would need to know what the
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
obligees income is
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
um as well to be able to to be able to
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
figure out if
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
then uh the family of the obligee would
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
then be um
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
in the need of for for public assistance
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
um i can point out that the under the
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
current child support formula the one
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we're living under right now
 
02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.470 align:start position:0%
that we're living under right now
that

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
for one child a an obligor who makes
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars a year or less
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
is supposed to pay
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
twenty five point six percent of this of
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
child support
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
generally we run into the self-support
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
reserve with that because that's a
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
fairly large one a fairly large number
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the percentage but as you
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
incrementally increase the obligor's
 
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.589 align:start position:0%
incrementally increase the obligor's
income

02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
you creep you creep away from the
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve and then the minute
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the obligor is making more than the
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
then the percentages
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the child support formula uh come
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
just just as a finance guide let you
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
know my head's starting to hurt because
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
i just want a number um but you can't
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
give me one i understand
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
do you have other information you want
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
to share with us
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
no that's it representative edwards
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
unless there's questions that we could
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
answer representative walner has a
 
02:02:30.719 --> 02:02:33.109 align:start position:0%
answer representative walner has a
question

02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:33.119 --> 02:02:35.109 align:start position:0%
question
so

02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
when i'm thinking about this i'm
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the lower income
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
side of the the
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
family member that had the lower the
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
don't doesn't this have the potential
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
to push a lot of those folks
 
02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
to push a lot of those folks
into

02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
needing state support through the tanf
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
program or food stamps
 
02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.629 align:start position:0%
program or food stamps
because

02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
they will now not or
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
child care reimbursement being on the
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
child care subsidy
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
and that's another one of the areas that
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
income eligibility is what determines
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
whether they how much child how much
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
child care they are entitled to
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
so doesn't this have a potential in all
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
of those areas
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i again i
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
think the department's stance is that
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
certainly by you know that the costs are
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and naturally if you're
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
increasing the self-support reserve
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
which is increasing the amount of
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
minimal support orders there may be
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
the potential for the impact on families
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
needing additional supports whether
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's through
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
additional programs that the state can
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
provide certainly i am not able to speak
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the income eligibility requirements
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the tanf programs or the child care
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
programs that you spoke of but certainly
 
02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:03.430 align:start position:0%
programs that you spoke of but certainly
the

02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child support services
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
would take the position that there may
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
be a potential impact of families
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
has the department
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
done any analysis with
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
the tanf
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
department or the child care department
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
or the food stamp has there been any
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
analysis of how this might affect the
 
02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:27.669 align:start position:0%
analysis of how this might affect the
caseload

02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
amount of funding it would need to
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
make this work
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
as a member
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
as a bureau of the member of the
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
division of economic and housing
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
stability which consists of the multiple
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
programs that you've spoken to it's
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
certainly something we haven't taken a
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
proactive approach to evaluate and
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
assess the analysis
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
as a as you had referenced here we are
 
02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child support services is
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
looking towards the new quadrennial
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
review that will be conducted this year
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
to provide us with the information that
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
we need
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
that will thus be
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
presented to all of you
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
to assist in looking at a current
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
economic analysis and the cost of living
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
of children
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
today with more current and updated
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
information that may be
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
able to assist um in creating a you know
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately a fair and appropriate child
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
support guidelines
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
after listening to this is it is it
 
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.709 align:start position:0%
after listening to this is it is it
close

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
close
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
enough for government work for me to
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
think of this bill into two two big
 
02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.470 align:start position:0%
think of this bill into two two big
things

02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
one we're changing the reserve numbers
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
for that are important to the
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
calculation but the second thing which
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
is almost totally separable is we're
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
trying to create a formula a simple
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
formula in order to calculate
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
in these joint custody situations how
 
02:06:04.719 --> 02:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
in these joint custody situations how
much

02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
is it fair to think of these in in two
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
big chunks
 
02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
big chunks
yes

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right um
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions uh
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
i think i have one more because i'm
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
trying to play out how the calculations
 
02:06:23.119 --> 02:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
trying to play out how the calculations
work

02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
and what the net effect might be
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
but in addition to the concern expressed
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
by representative walner about the
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
people at the very low end of the scale
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
will this not have
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
an effect that might be significant for
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
tana or other
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
pro state programs
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
when we have
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
an obligor who has a relatively high
 
02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.310 align:start position:0%
an obligor who has a relatively high
income

02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the kids are with a relatively
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
lower income parent
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
who might
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
buy the reduction in the amount that
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
they're getting from the obligor be
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
forced into needing
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
extra supports whether they be child
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
care or housing subsidies or other
 
02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:16.149 align:start position:0%
care or housing subsidies or other
things

02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
is is that a
 
02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:19.030 align:start position:0%
is is that a
potential

02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
issue that we ought to keep in the back
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's certainly um yes whenever we are
 
02:07:29.679 --> 02:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's certainly um yes whenever we are
considering

02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
considering
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um again
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know the goal of the child support
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the goal is to um try to
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide the most
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of support and enough
 
02:07:44.639 --> 02:07:45.910 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of support and enough
support

02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
to support the families so all of those
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
things should be taken into
 
02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:53.750 align:start position:0%
things should be taken into
consideration

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm trying to uh focus now just
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
on the first component which is which is
 
02:08:04.239 --> 02:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
on the first component which is which is
the

02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
reserve amount
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
if we wanted
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
because it's simple and we only want to
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
deal with one variable if we wanted to
 
02:08:12.719 --> 02:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
deal with one variable if we wanted to
freeze

02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
freeze
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
the 14 812 and keep it at that
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
and not go to 15 456
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
we can't really do that by changing this
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill in a simple way that we'd have to
 
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
go back to this
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
2021 fpl or something to make an
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level is set by the
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal department of health and human
 
02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
federal department of health and human
services

02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and that is um set uh every april 1st
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
so a new
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve amount would be set
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
for 2022
 
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.350 align:start position:0%
for 2022
this

02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
coming april
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
whether to increase as you
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
recommend or suggest
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
you know i really don't know that the
 
02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:16.870 align:start position:0%
you know i really don't know that the
department

02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
really can speak to one or the other
 
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.669 align:start position:0%
really can speak to one or the other
certainly

02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
but would be willing to
 
02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:26.069 align:start position:0%
but would be willing to
assist

02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
assist
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
with anybody in the development of you
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
know language or insight
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
for future if need be all right to be
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
clear i wasn't suggesting it i was
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
floating the question as a brainstorming
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help me understand the
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
connection between all of these
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
different laws this is a new area i've
 
02:09:44.719 --> 02:09:45.669 align:start position:0%
different laws this is a new area i've
we

02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
normally don't get into this area
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds to me though after hearing
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
you what you may have just educated me
 
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:53.669 align:start position:0%
you what you may have just educated me
on

02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that this change from 14 8 to 15 4
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
is is basically on
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
autopilot because we're just following
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
the federal law and we're updating it
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
this this this change in reserve is not
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
based on this law it's just another
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
factor that's going on on in parallel
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
correct our the self-support reserve is
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
is defined in the statute currently as
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
115 of the federal self-support reserve
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill upped
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
it to 120 and then the amendment upped
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
it to 150. obviously the number
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be the number yeah okay so so what
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
we do have in our control with this
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
particular bill is whether we accept the
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
115 or the 150 or some other number
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
correct all right i think i understand
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay do you are there any other
 
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.229 align:start position:0%
okay do you are there any other
questions

02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
do you have anything that you think we
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's a question thank you for the
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that question um no
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards uh
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for coming by
 
02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for coming by
uh

02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i think we know more i don't know that
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
i know what we should do but is there
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else in attendance that would
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
come come forward state your name and
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
tell us if you represent yourself or an
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
hi i'm kevin watten i'm just a parent of
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
three girls representing myself
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
w o
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to uh address a few
 
02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to uh address a few
things

02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh the first being when we were talking
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
about how the clerks were gonna have to
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
have more paperwork
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
um i've represented myself in family
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
court for the last six years might be
 
02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.510 align:start position:0%
court for the last six years might be
five

02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
you currently if you go ask a clerk to
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
help you fill out paperwork they tell
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
you they are not your legal
 
02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
you they are not your legal
representation

02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
they have no legal right to do that
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
so realistically whether you change the
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
formula or not they're not doing more
 
02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.109 align:start position:0%
formula or not they're not doing more
paperwork

02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's just my experience in the court
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that adding
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
any expense to the court or any
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
confusion there when the clerks can just
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
say we have no legal right to help you
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
on this paperwork
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
ah secondly i just like to give
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
another little piece
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
of knowledge to you guys about some of
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
this stuff
so

02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
currently with child support in new
 
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
currently with child support in new
hampshire

02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
the uh when it was set up it was set up
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
so long ago
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
that women weren't working and that's
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
just a fact it was before i was born
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
so the federal government
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
ordered the states to set it all up and
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government then set up tanf
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
and when the states ordered child
 
02:12:47.599 --> 02:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
and when the states ordered child
support

02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
because the women weren't working 72
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
cents for every dollar in child support
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
ordered is reimbursed to tanf
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
that is still a fact today
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
so when they sit there and they say 8
 
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.669 align:start position:0%
so when they sit there and they say 8
percent

02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
are the lower incomes
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that means guys like me and my family
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
who i currently will be paying about
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars in child
 
02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars in child
support

02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
tanf is receiving from the federal
 
02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.149 align:start position:0%
tanf is receiving from the federal
government

02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars so
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
for every dollar the state gets from or
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
has ordered me to pay
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
they get about 72 cents
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
that adds up if you have only eight
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
percent on the low income
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of profit there for the
 
02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:30.790 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of profit there for the
state

02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point that out
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
because i find it very frustrating
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
when people sit there and say oh
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i know it's not all of you guys
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
but when my kids and my child support
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
are being used to balance the state
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
budget for tanf
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
and my family doesn't benefit from that
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
and i do know that there are kids that
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
need it but when it becomes a political
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing that's used against me in the
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
family courts
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
and the current laws i find it very
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
frustrating very unfair
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
have you said everything you wanted to
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
say that's it i i i have a question for
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
you if you'll entertain one yep
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
when when you
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
i i i just want to uh make sure i
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying when you
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
say that um
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
the money goes through tanf and and at
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
72 cents per dollar of what you pay
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and you said that that's a profit
 
02:14:32.550 --> 02:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that is a kick back to the state of new
 
02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
that is a kick back to the state of new
hampshire

02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay profit kickback
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand it's it's my
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
belief that that money that goes back
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
stays within the tanf funding
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
and is used to support
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
tanf payments that it isn't
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
retained to
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
increase our state surplus
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
but it is used to increase the amount of
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
resources available for tanf payments
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
do you do
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
do you know which way
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
that works i did go meet with the
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
department at one point and they uh they
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
as far as i know it does stay in the
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
tanf department
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't give us a breakdown as to
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
where they spent that money
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
a question by representative weiler
 
02:15:21.679 --> 02:15:22.470 align:start position:0%
a question by representative weiler
so

02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
you pay money to the state
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
no the state
 
02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:26.709 align:start position:0%
no the state
takes

02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
takes
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
my money directly out of my paycheck all
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
money is taken from you by the state yes
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
it supposedly goes
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
to your ex-wife or whoever's taking care
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
of the children yes
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
you don't think she's getting
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
the whole amount that was taken from
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
your pay no she does get the whole
 
02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
your pay no she does get the whole
amount

02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
she gets the whole amount and they i
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
think they charge like 25 bucks a year
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
for maintaining our account but what
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
they don't talk about in their
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
department is that for every dollar they
 
02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
department is that for every dollar they
order

02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
they get a 72 cents kickback from the
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's money that comes into new
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire's tanf
 
02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:09.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire's tanf
program

02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
based on that so when they sit here and
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
they're worried about raising the self
 
02:16:12.639 --> 02:16:13.830 align:start position:0%
they're worried about raising the self
reserve

02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
ten dollars a week
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
they don't talk about how
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
guys like me who pay four hundred
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in child support are
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
getting them a three hundred thousand
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
dollar kickback
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%

and and and how the money flows through
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
when somebody is on tanf through the
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
they assign their right to child support
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
so if they have a child support order
 
02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:52.790 align:start position:0%
so if they have a child support order
uh

02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
money coming in that money then is
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
collected by the by the state and is
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
kept by the state
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh to pay back the tanf that is going
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
to the household
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
in almost all cases
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
the money that's going into the
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
household is more than the child support
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
order that's coming in
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
in cases that are non-tanf
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
which is the vast majority of our cases
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
um money comes in money goes out there
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
is no there's no kickbacks there's no
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
the our system is funded
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
66 percent by the by the federal
 
02:18:28.319 --> 02:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
66 percent by the by the federal
government

02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
so we submit to them a very detailed
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
list of expenses
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
reimburse us 66 percent
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
when a in a tanf case when t when the
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
money is
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
paid back
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
if there are arrears
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
some of that money goes back to the
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
federal government because they've paid
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
for 66 percent of it so we give them 66
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
of it back
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
that is that's the there are some
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
incentive funds that we earn for
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
the certain number of uh getting enough
 
02:19:00.559 --> 02:19:02.309 align:start position:0%
the certain number of uh getting enough
paternity

02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
paternity
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um cases done um
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
order establishment
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
establishing um
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting payments on towards arrears
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
but none of it is based on if we get a
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
higher child support number
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh in a particular case
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
which leaves us to to
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
be able to ask the court to establish
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable court orders because
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
because the numbers are based on what
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
what um
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
is happening in that individual
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
family so so to stick the finger on the
 
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
family so so to stick the finger on the
issue

02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh is there a scenario where the
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
department collects from parents to
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
feed the system that then goes out the
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
other door
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
is there a scenario in which
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
the department um profits or retains a
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
surplus as a result of that
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
managing that transaction
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
no there isn't there's um in cases that
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
are that have never been on tanf the
 
02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:03.429 align:start position:0%
are that have never been on tanf the
the

02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
obligee is charged 35
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
per year
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
for to uh
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
for all the costs
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
um but there are no other
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
no other expenses that are charged
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay so like in civil asset forfeiture
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes an argument that
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
policing for profit incentive to go do
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
that there's there's no sort of child
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
care for profit incentive going on in
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
your system
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
no sir and if and if in the very rare
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
case where the amount of child support
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
is close to the amount of the truck of
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
the of the tanf if the child support's
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be more than the tanf
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
somebody the the person on tanf's going
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
to go off tanf and get the child support
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bigger amount
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
no i think that
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
cleared that up for me all right thank
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
you uh is there anyone else mr dejoy did
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
you have anything you wanted to share
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
with us
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh what i'd like to do at
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
this point is before we take any further
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
action as a committee i would like to
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
recess until 12 30 which is just in six
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
seven minutes and this is just for uh
 
02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.670 align:start position:0%
seven minutes and this is just for uh
caucuses

02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
because uh i wanna i wanna just check
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
with people to figure out
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay so it being 12 30 i'm going to call
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
us out of recess um
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh we just came back from
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
two uh partisan uh caucuses um
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
what what i i think uh we're predisposed
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
to doing is um
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
passing 1647 out of division three on an
 
02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:50.790 align:start position:0%
passing 1647 out of division three on an
otp

02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
otp
 
02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
with a committee report that that says
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
this this bill could use more work
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
specifically relative to trying to
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
simplify the the formulas and the
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
worksheets a little bit more so that
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's easier to access
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
for layman
 
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
for layman
um

02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
um but that's just going to be part of
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation i think
 
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:15.990 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation i think
ultimately

02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're looking like maybe
 
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's a committee a conference or
 
02:28:21.429 --> 02:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen to
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
fix this bill and that would be done by
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
the policy committee not us
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's that's what i where
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
i think we're at do you do you want to
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
share with us your thoughts before we do
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
well i don't i i don't really have
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
financial information i mean i'm on the
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee and i want to know
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
what does this call what is the
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
potential cost here to the state
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
how much will the case load increase i
 
02:28:50.319 --> 02:28:51.190 align:start position:0%
how much will the case load increase i
mean

02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
we will potentially have more
 
02:28:54.399 --> 02:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
we will potentially have more
tanf

02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
tanf
 
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
tan of payout will potentially have more
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm fairly sure that
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
there will be more child care
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
costs by the state
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
food stamps housing i think and we
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
didn't get any of that information
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
today we got
 
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
we really
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
no one came to talk about those parts
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
the people from child support
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
pay are the collector basically
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the child support but we didn't hear
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
the other side of that
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
and what it means
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
to the state budget
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was what we were
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
then it would be for me a value of
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
the new
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
this new process
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
what it would would cost but i don't
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
have i couldn't
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
i couldn't defend it
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
our decision on a financial
 
02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:51.830 align:start position:0%
our decision on a financial
reason

02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
so so what's your preference for a
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
disposition on this bill today i would
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
put it i would put it to study
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
and spend some time over the next
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
several months
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
um figuring out
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
what it would cost
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
um really
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
maybe some sort it maybe we could do
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
something jointly with
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
the child and family law committee but
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
this feels irresponsible of us to pass
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
this along when i i couldn't go out on
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
the street and say how much it's
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
what it means to the state
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
and that's who i'm supposed to be
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
looking at for right now if if i had an
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
otp vote to cast it would be because i
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
think there isn't uh a need for
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
this formula to help
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
satisfy the problem that we have
 
02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
satisfy the problem that we have
currently

02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
that uh joint custody situations are
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
just on their face appear to be turning
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
out unfairly and that that in itself is
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
a big advance for new hampshire to have
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
that in place or is that not sufficient
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
in your mind
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
no because i i don't think i mean i
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
think that we need to obviously and
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening here is to look
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the formula and how
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
the child support is calculated and to
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
come up with what's a fair system
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
but we didn't do the other part of the
 
02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:14.630 align:start position:0%
but we didn't do the other part of the
homework

02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
homework
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that was to figure out how much
 
02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.630 align:start position:0%
and that was to figure out how much
other

02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
state resources will need in order
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
to accomplish
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
the first i mean it feels like sort of a
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've only done half of the calculation
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
here and
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
um for me i need to i would want to know
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
what a policy like this
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
really means to state government
 
02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:39.429 align:start position:0%
really means to state government
uh

02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh i'll just second
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i want to ask
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and and maybe the department
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
are are we asking for
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that are attainable with more
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
analysis or are we really
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
sort of stuck
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the indeterminable
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
world here
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'm really not sure i think we would
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
depend on the department to provide that
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
information so they'd be better able to
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
anyone from the department want to
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
say that whether or not you think you
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
could actually produce us some analysis
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
so that we understand what the gov the
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
again i still think we are in an
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
indeterminable state of in terms of a
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
cost analysis however i do hope that the
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
upcoming quadrennial review will assist
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
us in
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know finding some more
 
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
you know finding some more
current

02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh more
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
relative information that may
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
be beneficial in terms of cost analysis
 
02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:54.309 align:start position:0%
be beneficial in terms of cost analysis
follow-up

02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
so what i hear from that is that
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
today you don't really have that
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
information you're working on it
 
02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
information you're working on it
and

02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
my question would be when when will this
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh report be ready
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we are the quadrennial review report
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
is being conducted this year with the
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
anticipation of a final report uh
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
available by the end of december
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that that would probably provide us
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
with some of the information
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
that would make this
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
we would understand what exactly what
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
yes it would give us more information on
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the current child support guidelines
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
and how it
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
in comparison to the economic analysis
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
of the cost of raising children and how
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
we are currently applying those in a
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
case review with the courts and with the
 
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
case review with the courts and with the
department

02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
so is there anyone that would be
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
available to work on on this
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
this quantitative analysis in parallel
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
with the quadrennial report instead of
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
in sync with it so that we could get
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
some information to the legislature in a
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
timely fashion
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the quadrennial review report will be
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
published and provided to the
 
02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.110 align:start position:0%
published and provided to the
legislature

02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
following the analysis right you said
 
02:34:17.359 --> 02:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
following the analysis right you said
december

02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
december
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
we need to decide sooner than that so my
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
question is is there a financial analyst
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
who can work on this in parallel instead
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
of waiting for the quadrennial so that
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
we have the analytical information we
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
would need to
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
help satisfy representative walner's
 
02:34:34.319 --> 02:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
help satisfy representative walner's
questions

02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:38.479 --> 02:34:40.309 align:start position:0%
well
sorry

02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
i think from listening to the discussion
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
here um we would need to rely on um
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
some of our sister departments in in
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
tanf child care and and that that type
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
of thing so we'd have to reach out to
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
them to see
 
02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
them to see
um

02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
if they're if
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
who they have available and what what
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
the time looks like but
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
we could certainly do that
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay mr williams is it putting you on
 
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
the spot too much to ask you if you
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
think um
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
a financial analysis can be coordinated
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
within the department to to get us some
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:21.710 align:start position:0%
thank you president edwards thank you um
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:23.030 align:start position:0%
thank you president edwards thank you um

[Music]
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
john williams i'm the director of
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs and i think it's a
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and i know that
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
when we contract with the vendor as part
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
of our quad runner review and i'm glad i
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
have the subject matter experts with us
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
today we do sometimes build into that
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
analysis the use of that contractor in
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the future prospectively not before the
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
report comes out but to assist with the
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and determining these cost
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
implications i would have to go back to
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
our agency to determine if we do have
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
the in-house available resources my
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
expectations are we gave due diligence
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the actual fiscal analysis that we
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
didn't provided to the lba on this and
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the conversation at least
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
with our existing resources that's why
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
we came back
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
with an indeterminable impact as it
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
might relate to increased utilization or
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
families going on to the tan of
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
temporary aid for needy families so that
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
is a very long-winded answer that i
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to the question
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can leverage any
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
additional resources such as a
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
contractor who actually does this kind
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
of financial economic analysis but
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
something something we could certainly
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
look into but i think in terms of your
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
timeline i don't see us being ready to
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
do that before your committee needs to
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
dispose of this bill
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
i suggest we
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
for study and come back out with
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
something in
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
january okay so so play that out in in
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
in my head for me uh if if we division
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
three asked finance to retain it and
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
that recommendation was accepted then
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
what would happen to this bill what what
 
02:37:04.290 --> 02:37:04.300 align:start position:0%
would then happen
 
02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
would then happen
[Music]

02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
well i think that in the
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
what we should do
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
would be just to
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
study the bill for the you know
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
period from now to or
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
may or june until november
 
02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
when we'd probably be asked to give some
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
sort of a report on whether this bill
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
should go for go forth in legislation in
 
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
should go for go forth in legislation in
january

02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
january
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think it would give us the time we
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
need to get some
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
more accurate
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
numbers from the department
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
hear more
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
from there are other groups who work on
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
child support and that they are not here
 
02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
child support and that they are not here
today

02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i would i think there's a lot more
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
information we need together before we
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
send this out
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe we do something jointly with
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
the child and family
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
law committee some sort of a study that
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
was joined i think that that would be
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
possible so that that's what i would do
 
02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:08.710 align:start position:0%
possible so that that's what i would do
but

02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:11.190 align:start position:0%
okay i
i

02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the intellectual argument i
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just itching to give the tools to
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
the judiciary to calculate a formula for
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
just uh joint custody if
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
i mean if we could just amend it so that
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's all that we passed i i i see
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
moving on that
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative what are your thoughts
 
02:38:32.399 --> 02:38:34.309 align:start position:0%
representative what are your thoughts
sir

02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
we really need data we won't have it
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
till the end of this
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
this session will be over
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
it would take new bills
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
by people with more expertise than us
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they would have to take some time to
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
study what happened from the quadrennial
 
02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:50.790 align:start position:0%
study what happened from the quadrennial
review

02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing we can do with this
 
02:38:52.399 --> 02:38:53.429 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing we can do with this
bill

02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
practically right now
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
kill it in interim study
 
02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
if that's what you want that's what's
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
going to happen to it so if you were to
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
make a motion what what would it sound
 
02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
make a motion what what would it sound
like

02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative walner how do you react
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think that sounds like a reasonable
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion and
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm i would personally spend the
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
time studying it i mean i know sometimes
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
things get into interim study and they
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't get the attention they need but i
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
so all that's good i the one reason why
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not afraid of an interim study is if
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
if we're the one that's holding we can
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
control it uh but
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
um also knowing that the senate version
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
is making its way through it's not like
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
this this is the only cowboy standing we
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know we've got the calvary coming
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
over the hill so
 
02:39:57.359 --> 02:39:58.950 align:start position:0%
over the hill so
um

02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay i understand so
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
in anyone from the department or or are
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
you mr head do you have any
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know oh my god don't do that kind of
 
02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
comments for us because i i think we're
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
cruising towards an interim study
 
02:40:13.439 --> 02:40:14.790 align:start position:0%
cruising towards an interim study
recommendation

02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to your last comment i do
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
believe because we have these two bills
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if we dealt with
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
them all in at the same time so to the
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
extent the interim study
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
would keep us from doing this in two
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
separate forms i think that's helpful i
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
do think the policy issues are important
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
so if there's a way of incorporating
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
children and family law into that
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
retained or that interim study status i
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful but i think
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's the if if
 
02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
if the thought is to to adopt whatever
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
the policy issues in this bill into the
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and have
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
have it essentially dealt with through
 
02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:55.750 align:start position:0%
have it essentially dealt with through
the

02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:56.710 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
at least through the committee of
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
conference i think that makes some sense
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
if the desire is to keep it alive you
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
know we can deal with it in both houses
 
02:41:03.359 --> 02:41:04.150 align:start position:0%
know we can deal with it in both houses
too

02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay so i hear we're not going to break
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
anything from your perspective uh
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh ms d did totowsky
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
are we going to break anything if we
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
interim study this
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.670 align:start position:0%
all right
great

02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
all right i think we're ready to hear a
 
02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
all right i think we're ready to hear a
motion

02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
may i say something yes so just
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
i understand everybody's saying that and
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
it makes sense the only
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
thing i might raise since there is this
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill is which is a senate
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
position if we is it there's no house
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
position in other words they wouldn't be
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
starting with
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
from the house's point of view
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill and
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
i think that should be taken into
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
consideration as well i mean is going to
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
be killing it basically because even if
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
you quote study it you have nothing to
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
study until after december and by after
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
december it's next term so um
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear to me even listening
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
to um all the uh
 
02:42:03.269 --> 02:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh witnesses
 
02:42:03.279 --> 02:42:04.469 align:start position:0%
uh witnesses
that

02:42:04.469 --> 02:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
even when the quadrennial thing is done
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be able to the
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
analysis will be able to be done that's
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
going to give us any better numbers than
 
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.269 align:start position:0%
going to give us any better numbers than
simply

02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
indeterminable because i mean i've been
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
thinking pretty hard about what it mean
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
what they would have to go through in
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
order to come up with something more
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
determinable and it'd be an incredibly
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
complex calculation because it's not a
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
calculation you'd have to know the
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
situation of every
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh situation currently in their control
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
and you'd have to know about the ones
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and by the way you're using the wrong
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
figure it was going to twenty thousand
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
dollars of income not fifteen so you're
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to grossly grow the number of
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
people that would be considered they
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what that would be because
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
obviously those people aren't in the
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
system right now so i think that's going
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
to remain indeterminable for the for the
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
clearly the senate bill is coming over
 
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be considered one way
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
or another and i think if we passed this
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
then the house would have a position so
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
that when the the either either dies
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
altogether or the house has a position
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
so they can actually discuss it with the
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
senate as opposed we just take the
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill whatever that is i've not
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
actually seen the senate bill thank you
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
so just a remark on that and then
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative weber uh
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i i'd say two things one if it comes
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
from the senate one of our committees
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
presumably child and family law would
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
would have an opportunity to hear it and
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
amend it knowing what they wanted to do
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
with this so so i
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
i still think we have a road to repair
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
if that's what we want to do
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then in my experience
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
even though when the house doesn't have
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
a formal position because we haven't
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
adopted something i've still found a
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of reasonableness to
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
listen and to work collaboratively but
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
i was just going to add to that and say
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
i because i've never sat on a second
 
02:43:51.439 --> 02:43:53.110 align:start position:0%
i because i've never sat on a second
committee

02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to this but the
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
house has already adopted the policy
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
by passing the bill out of the policy
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
committee so it seems to me that there
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
is a fairly good
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
02:44:10.319 --> 02:44:12.389 align:start position:0%
argument that
um

02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know that that that the house did
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
establish a position that they thought
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
the policy was good
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that what
 
02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:21.670 align:start position:0%
and that what
the

02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee is doing is
 
02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:25.349 align:start position:0%
finance committee is doing is
establishing

02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not sure
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
what the policy is going to do
 
02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:31.590 align:start position:0%
what the policy is going to do
to

02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
the various issues that it impacts in
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
the state budget but that the underlying
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
policy is as far as i can see the policy
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the house thank you
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh that sounds brilliant to me thank you
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh are there
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
if there are no other comments i i think
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's time for a motion
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
where where am i hearing that uh yeah
 
02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:55.429 align:start position:0%
where where am i hearing that uh yeah
yes

02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
this has been indeterminable and sent
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
for interim study for the last three
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
years we went through hb 616 hb228
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
this topic and i've studied it because i
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
love it every day has been
 
02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
kicked down the road several times
 
02:45:25.269 --> 02:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
already since 2016.
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
this will be the fifth iteration of this
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
bill the 431 bill as was was noted is is
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
actually quite in opposition to this
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
what the language of this bill is this
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill is the culmination of all the
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
studies it is the culmination of all the
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
research that's been done it's been
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
heavily researched the impact which is
 
02:45:43.359 --> 02:45:44.790 align:start position:0%
heavily researched the impact which is
indeterminable

02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
by the as was stated again
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminable because of that
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
number which was stated as eight percent
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
of people that may receive some funds or
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
assistance that this is a matching and
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
then the court costs we addressed that
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
already this was going to be you know
 
02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
the new amended version will be up three
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
years so you're already seeing a net
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost to the state and
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's very clear and to pass this one
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
more time down the road
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
is another year
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
another year and then this will never
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
come to terms the effort i think as was
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned is to get sb
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
431 431 together with this and come to
 
02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
have hopefully they have some offspring
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is is amenable to everybody but to
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
to send this out for interim study again
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
is catastrophic what we do know is
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
determinable is and we've all heard it
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
stated and it was just the last time
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'll say it
 
02:46:37.279 --> 02:46:38.389 align:start position:0%
i'll say it
currently

02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the higher earning parent is in an
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
indigent state you want to talk about
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
who needs help that's anyone that's had
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
child support orders issued since 2018
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
the higher earner not in it there's no
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
exceptions to it silva v silva
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
we heard about the anderson case they
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
are in the indigenous state that's who's
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
suffering to pass this down another four
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
years will extrapolate to another amount
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
of our population of new hampshire
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
children without enough clothing without
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
enough options that's the real thing
 
02:47:11.269 --> 02:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
this is trying to address it's been in a
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
room it's been interim studied
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
for four or five years now
 
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
you heard the research so thank you all
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
right so to clarify my thinking on the
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
timing i i i don't think we're going to
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
end this term without
 
02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
handing the governor something to sign
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking more of a you know
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
a relay race
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
where we're waiting for the the person
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
behind us to come up and hand us the
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
baton so that we can
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
wrap it up and resolve it my objective
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
to get the legislature to agree on this
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
because i think the compelling argument
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
is we need to handle the joint custody
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
situation with the formula
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's that that that's what i think we
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
so if we do interim study this bill that
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we're
 
02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:01.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we're
postponing

02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
postponing
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
action legislative action on the idea
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
until january we're just waiting to get
 
02:48:07.750 --> 02:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
these things married up so that we can
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
do something yes but marriages of two

two sb431 and hp 1647 is to have

02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
offspring come out but by having 1647
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
completely wiped off off the
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
table is is catastrophic all right i i i
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
hear you i i do hear you because there's
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
equal equal parts to this both the
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and that but both that is
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the interim study that will be
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it having two parties
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
come together to to come to terms all
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you for your input thank you
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%

02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
he's made me think that that octopass is
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the way to go just so we get it out of
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
our hands get get a position that's
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
established and get to look at what
 
02:48:57.920 --> 02:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
established and get to look at what
happens

02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that that nearly concludes our
 
02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
our business for the day i i just i just
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to come back to uh one point
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
um about finance looking at policy
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner uh when we when we
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
hb 1642 relative to lead testing we
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
accepted the the walner
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
amendment to it and the walnut amendment
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
reads to me
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
as though this is all peer policy and
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
not financial and so
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
i was perfectly comfortable accepting it
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
because i think it uh improved the
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the policy people and wasn't
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
fighting them it was just clarifying
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
would you would you please state your
 
02:50:52.870 --> 02:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
rationale on on what we did and why we
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
well we ended up we ended up i thought
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bill was inexpedient
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
so in the end i mean
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we got rid of it the reason i
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
thought it was because i mean it
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
maybe had no financial impact on the
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
state itself but
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually there there were financial
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
impacts on families for sure
 
02:51:20.230 --> 02:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
if if they would lose their child care
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah because they wouldn't be able to
 
02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.469 align:start position:0%
yeah because they wouldn't be able to
work

02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay so there it was an indirect cost to
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
the state and reduced employment or
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
something all right
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
so um so with that
 
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh we're wrapped up and so
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
i will at uh 12
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
this cannabis bill
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
they want to take and divide up the
 
02:52:04.479 --> 02:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
they want to take and divide up the
revenue

02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
means
