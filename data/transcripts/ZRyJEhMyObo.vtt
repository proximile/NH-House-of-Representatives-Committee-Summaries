thank you
 
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
so this morning we have
 
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
a list a couple of bills and we are
 
00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
going to start off with HB the hearing
 
00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 align:start position:0%
for HB 300
 
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I invite representative Ebel to come
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
up and introduce this bill so I'm
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing for house bill 300.
 
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Karen Ebel I
 
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack District 7 and that
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
is Newbury and New London
 
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
HB 300 which would prohibit the disposal
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
of certain food waste
 
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
of certain food waste
um

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly straightforward Bill uh
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
basically what it says is that any
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
person which would include
 
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 align:start position:0%
businesses of course as it's defined
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
that generates one ton of food waste per
 
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
week or greater can't dispose of that
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
food waste in a landfill or incinerator
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
as long as there is an alternative
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
facility with the capacity to accept the
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
food waste within 50 miles
 
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
the order of preference and how you
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
would dispose of the food waste
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
basically reflects the um the food
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
resource higher hierarchy which is you
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
want to try to get most of it that you
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
can to humans before you actually
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
dispose of it so for any business that
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
is having to
 
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.230 align:start position:0%
is having to
uh

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
use an alternative form of getting their
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
food waste as opposed to land filling it
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
they have the Alternatives of of using
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
food banks
 
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
farms and also of course composting
 
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
farms and also of course composting
facilities

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
so in conversations with the chair
 
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 align:start position:0%
um I did suggest that
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
in the course of introducing this bill I
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
would kind of give a history of where we
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
are in the state as far as solid waste
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
because actually I was thinking about it
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
as I was driving down here today we've
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
really come a long way since 2019 and I
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
want to uh when a lot of this started
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
with a legislative study committee that
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
I chaired that was looking pretty deeply
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
into Recycling and solid waste issues
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
and that was prompted by the China
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
national sword policy in which they said
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
that they weren't
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
um going to take a lot of our plastic
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
and mixed paper anymore and so a lot of
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
our towns were floundering and that's
 
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
what initiated the interest in the study
 
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.309 align:start position:0%
what initiated the interest in the study
committee

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that was in uh late 2019 and I really I
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
want to thank the committee very much
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
for all the support that it's given and
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
the support the Des has provided
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
um in really trying to pull the state
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
out of kind of the Dark Ages as far as
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management is concerned
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think uh where a lot of us may be
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
frustrated that we haven't made more
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
progress but I really I I and I put a
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
lot of hyperlinks in the testimony that
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
was submitted online and I want to go
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
through this just briefly for you
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
because this is what we have done and
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
I I think we should all be proud of the
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
work that's been accomplished the first
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
thing we did was we updated our Solid
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Waste diversion goals the diversion
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
goals that were on the books on the
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
statute went back to 2000 and nothing
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
had been updated since and needless to
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
say we hadn't achieved them our
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
diversion goals now are we want to
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
divert by weight 25 percent of what's
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
landfilled or incinerated by 2030 and
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're shooting for 45 percent by 2050.
 
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
one of the huge things that's happened
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
is that we've issued a solid waste
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
management plan a long-range plan this
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
plan had not been updated since 2003.
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this took a lot of work on the part of
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
the department and I'm really proud of
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
the product that we have put forth
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
we also created the solid waste working
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
group which I chair which was
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
specifically tasked to work with des and
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the development of the plan but also to
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
help move the state forward
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
in general to to do better with our
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
solid waste the solid waste working
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
group is a stakeholder group it includes
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
representatives of public and private
 
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.329 align:start position:0%
representatives of public and private
landfills

00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:01.339 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
smaller towns bigger cities we have
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
someone from the business and economic
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
Administration Bea I we really try to
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
someone from unh
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
so we really tried to put together a
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
group that was representative of the
 
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.949 align:start position:0%
group that was representative of the
state

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
in addition uh Des which had been the
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
especially the solid waste Bureau had
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
been severely underfunded for the last
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years due to budget cuts
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult for them to do
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
any planning and part of the problem
 
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:44.420 align:start position:0%
that we have had is that Des
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
hasn't been able to surprise to provide
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
any sort of planning or other support
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's been difficult for them to our
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
towns and to our businesses so when you
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
have a situation like what happened with
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
national with the national sword policy
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
with the Chinese all of a sudden the
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
towns are floundering and this is a
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
Global Market at the same time as this
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
is an intensely personal and local issue
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
this is a global issue that affects so
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
many people in so many ways and clearly
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
economic and Des the planning department
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
that they once had had been wiped out so
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy to say that there has
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
been some more funding at the state
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
level to allow them to add a little you
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
know some more staff but they've created
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
a planning department again which we
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
haven't had in decades and there's two
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
folks here
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
there the department is small but it's
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
mighty and I just want to give them Mike
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
Nork and Paige Wilson a shout out
 
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:53.540 align:start position:0%
because they've got a lot of heart and
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
they've really been unbelievably helpful
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
through this whole process especially
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mike because when I started I didn't
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
know what MSW or a Murph was or anything
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so lots of uh lots of acronyms the
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
second thing that we did I mean the last
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
one other thing that we did we've
 
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:15.260 align:start position:0%
created the solid waste management fund
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
that is a fund that would establish a
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
matching grant program for towns and
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
businesses to do better with their
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and their Solid Waste
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
diversion methods and
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
although it's not funded at this point
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
and we'll hear about enough we'll hear
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
another bill later today where we'll
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
talk more about the funding this is
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
really a critical piece of our
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
um overall umbrella policy to get our
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
state back in the game and moving
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
forward again we are so behind from a
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
regional standpoint other states are
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
very aggressively working to promote
 
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.130 align:start position:0%
very aggressively working to promote
recycling

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.140 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
composting you know uh and basically
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
Banning more and more things from going
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
into landfills and they're progressively
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
closing down their landfills if you read
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
the uh Globe article front page of the
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
Sunday magazine you know that
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is shutting down its
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and we're sitting here with
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
ours and needless to say
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
we're getting a lot of trash that isn't
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
going to other places in other states
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
so this particular measure is a really
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
big opportunity for us to step out of
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
the planning stage and into the action
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
stage I've had more people say they're
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
really concerned that we've come this
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
far we've got our plan in place but
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do anything to make
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
it happen
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
so this uh the based on on the research
 
00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:56.779 align:start position:0%
that the solid waste working group did
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
we decided to recommend legislation that
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
would focus very clearly on uh food
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
waste you'll hear more about it I'm sure
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
but 25 percent of weight according to
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
the EPA that goes into landfills is food
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
waste we can do a tremendous amount of
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
good if we start the way we've suggested
 
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
here focusing on large generators of
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
food waste and and that way we can do
 
00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:28.430 align:start position:0%
food waste and and that way we can do
better

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
um it is a chicken and egg issue you
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
need infrastructure to receive the food
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
waste but if you're going to be putting
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know collecting your food waste you
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
also want to
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
um have some place to put it it's uh
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked to other states they said it
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually marries really well because if
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
businesses know that food waste has to
 
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.269 align:start position:0%
businesses know that food waste has to
be

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
um just gotten rid of in different ways
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
they'll start to develop uh businesses
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
to receive that food waste and I've
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
talked to several smaller businesses
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
that are really excited to hear about
 
00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:08.690 align:start position:0%
that are really excited to hear about
this

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.610 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:09.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
there are also Food Bank folks food
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
insecurity folks that are super excited
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
to hear about this because they're
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
looking forward to getting more food to
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
feed the hungry which of course is what
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is all about
 
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.410 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is all about
um

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing I I just want
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
to comment that there is a fiscal note
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
on this I I just like to encourage the
 
00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:38.030 align:start position:0%
on this I I just like to encourage the
um

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to focus on the
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
policy aspect of this because many
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
policy bills if we adopt the policy it's
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
sent over to finance to talk about the
 
00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:52.699 align:start position:0%
um the financial aspect of it
 
00:14:52.699 --> 00:14:54.590 align:start position:0%
um the financial aspect of it
and

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to say again let's not let
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
our plans uh sit on the shelf and gather
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
dust I'm not sure if he's been able to
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
get here yet but Henry veyer was going
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
to be here from Waste Management if you
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
had any questions for him he'd be happy
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
to um answer that
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll see if the committee
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
has any questions thank you thank you
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.210 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you for
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
um during your testimony you mentioned
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh that Farms could be a possible source
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
of taking the food waste have we updated
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
our compost laws uh for that
 
00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.569 align:start position:0%
our compost laws uh for that
well

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
in in the process of uh trotting out all
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
the exciting things that we've done I
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
would say that uh the other thing that's
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
really exciting that we've done is we've
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
updated our composting Rigs and Mr Nork
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
is here if you want to hear more about
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
that he can tell you
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
the main thing was to try to sort of
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
loosen up a little bit on on the
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
regulations that apply to taking compost
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
and one small comp smaller composting
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
business I know is working with our town
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
they actually take it to a farm in Derry
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
and when we were doing our study
 
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.650 align:start position:0%
and when we were doing our study
committee

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.660 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
hearings there was interest in the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community when they came to
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
testify because they were looking
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
forward to being able to do more
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
composting on site in addition to their
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
committee representative Dotsy
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
um I have uh how did you decide on one
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
ton and 50 miles and can you quantify
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
a one ton in terms of who would is that
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
restaurant it's hard for me to
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
understand a ton of food a week just
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
seems like a lot it does seem like a lot
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
but if you've if you compost and you lug
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
your bags to the transfer station you'll
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
be amazed at how much less your bags
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
weigh if you don't have food waste in
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
them anyway
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
um okay so basically in deciding which
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
way to go on the legislation we looked
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
at what our neighboring states were
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
doing across the Northeast and
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
um virtually every one of them started
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
with the one ton per week measurement
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
and that just seemed reasonable but like
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
you I had a hard time sort of
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
envisioning it so I actually talked to
 
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:49.220 align:start position:0%
someone in the business yesterday agric
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
agricycle because they collect they
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
collect this and they take they take the
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
food waste to Maine where they produce
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
energy with it which a whole is a whole
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
nother aspect that you know I haven't
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
really talked that much about
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
so he told me that if you have 64 gallon
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
totes which is how a lot of this stuff
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
is collected
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
each tote depending on how closely you
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
pack it is 200 to
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
so you multiply that out and he said
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
that's eight to ten tons a week
 
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
eight to ten totes a week which makes a
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
ton right so as far as the 50 miles
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
I I be I'd encourage the committee not
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
to get really hung up on the 50 miles if
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
the committee is interested in doing
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
something like this which I really hope
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you know you can think about the
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
mileage a lot of states have used 20.
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts used zero so I just went
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
part way in between
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
um the 50-mile radius of course doesn't
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
just apply to composting facilities it
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
applies to food banks it would apply to
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
Farms you know I think a lot of those
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
things could very well be within the
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
50-mile radius but
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
um looking at models from other states
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
it is true that many of them use the one
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
ton and 20 mile as opposed to the larger
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
number that I've chosen and as I said
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
before Massachusetts had
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
um zero
 
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.310 align:start position:0%
um zero
so

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative smart you
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think I have a
 
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think I have a
question

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.830 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's regulations for or appears to be
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
regulations for out date and sell by
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
dates on foods and you talk about giving
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
it to the needy or hungry how do you get
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
um because I
 
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:16.220 align:start position:0%
I have a small farm and we've approached
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and and various
 
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.130 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and and various
retail

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
to get their what they're throwing away
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
because it goes by sell by
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and we've been told they're not
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell it to us or give it to
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
us because
 
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.409 align:start position:0%
us because
um

00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh we if we ate it and we got sick we
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
could sue them uh so they're not
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
releasing any of that is there anything
 
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
releasing any of that is there anything
about

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.650 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
how to get around that or relaxing that
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
law are we removing sell by dates what's
 
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.789 align:start position:0%
law are we removing sell by dates what's
um

00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
when we were working
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
hb617 study committee one of the things
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we actually wanted to focus on was
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
food food safety regulations to see you
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
know as you say if you if you want to
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
get food to the hungry
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an issue and they're
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
they're important but you also don't
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to overdo it
 
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
want to overdo it
um

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of covid the study
 
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
committee that I had put in a bill uh to
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
study this stuff went went sideways and
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
so that has not been done it's something
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
I think we'll go we'll be talking about
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
at the working group
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
I have heard of this issue I'm hoping
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
that there's someone here from the food
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
um you know bank group that can talk a
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about the sell-by dates but I
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
did have a pretty long conversation with
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
someone at Hannaford actually and you
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
know they freeze the meat they work very
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
seamlessly with folks from the food
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
banks that come in and get it and my
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
impression is that maybe the sell-by
 
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.610 align:start position:0%
impression is that maybe the sell-by
date

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be is here to as much by
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
the food banks but
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a really important question
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
and um I'm hoping there's someone here
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
that might have more information on that
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee for representative evil
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh who the way this bill is
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
written who do you feel is going to be
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
most affected by it what what types of
 
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:49.130 align:start position:0%
most affected by it what what types of
businesses

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I looked into that a little bit and I
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
talked to some folks from from other
 
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
talked to some folks from from other
states

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
hospitals perhaps
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
um grocery stores food processors folks
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
like that very large restaurants I don't
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not sure restaurants would be
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
particularly affected
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
I I will say that I think that
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of larger institutions are very
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
interested in doing something better
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
with their waste not just food waste
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're already having to deal with the
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
food waste in one way this is just
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
another sort of recyclable that has to
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
be separated in a different way you know
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
they still have to pay tipping fees for
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
the wait whether it's being separated or
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
not separated and you know it's it's
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
again sort of this chicken and egg issue
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
I mean you want to make sure that
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's the infrastructure to to support
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
um the amount of food waste that would
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
come down
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
and I would just reiterate you know we
 
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
have a plan now we want to do better
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
with what we're doing with solid waste
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is a great first step from a from a
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint and and you know if we
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
want to divert food from our landfills I
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
think this is the way to go and one
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing that I didn't mention is food in
 
00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:29.299 align:start position:0%
landfills also produces
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
methane which is like a horrible
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas as it as it starts to
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
dispose to degrade so that's another
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
savings and then of course there's the
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
energy piece but anyway I digress
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Howard
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I was going to
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
ask you about methane because doesn't
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
composting also produce methane
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay so another thing that I've learned
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
um in landfills it's an anaerobic
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
atmosphere so there's not a lot of
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
oxygenation and there's actually not a
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
huge despite what a lot of people may
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's actually not a huge
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
amount of degradation that goes into
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
land that happens in landfills so if you
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
landfill something
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
it's really not going anywhere any
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
degradation that occurs is um
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's like a daily cover I know Mike
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
Nork is really proud of me
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
there's daily cover that's like soil
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
over the top of the landfill and the
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
water when it rains it can percolate
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
through and that's what starts some of
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
the degradation and that's what ends up
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
and you're really nauseous landfill
 
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.570 align:start position:0%
and you're really nauseous landfill
leachate

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
leachate
 
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.220 align:start position:0%
so it produces methane in that anaerobic
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
non-oxygenated situation but when you do
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
it out in the open air it's not
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
generating the methane
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
I was worried about that myself
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
so is there a uh procedure for how the
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
amount of food waste that's being
 
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
produced and diverted is going to be
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
tracked and measured
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
I would ask that of the department if
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
this policy is
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
um just I just want to say that if this
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
policy is adopted which again I really
 
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:27.380 align:start position:0%
hope it is
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
the agency obviously would have to come
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
up with some sort of regulation for
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
administration of it follow up follow up
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
so does the does the bill have
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority uh for that purpose
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
um under 149 M the agency is authorized
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
to implement regulations thank you um I
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make a note on the
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
measurement I had some concern on how
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
you figure out how much a ton is there's
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
also new MOA food estimators which
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
according to representatives of the
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
agencies that administer these programs
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
in other states they tend they use the
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
estimators as well
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.430 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
yeah

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
applaud the idea I just don't understand
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
exactly if I'm a grocer
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
say I'm the manager of Shaw's and I got
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
1.5 tons of
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
expired food
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
what exactly do I do with that 1.5 times
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
I can't take it to them now
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
what do I do with it
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
well first of all if there's uh
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
facility that has adequate capacity you
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
can reach out to food banks or whatever
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
within the hierarchy to try to get rid
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
of your your food waste you obviously
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
have to isolate it in some way and
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
honestly I think many Grocers are trying
 
00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:05.179 align:start position:0%
to do this sort of thing
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns so let's let's talk
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
about uh agricycle which happens to be
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
the group that I spoke to yesterday they
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
have a contract with Hannaford's and
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
they bring totes to Hannaford 64 gallon
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
totes and the manager at Hannaford said
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
they just put all their food waste into
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
these totes and agricycle actually has a
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
mechanism whereby the food can be
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
depackaged so if you have like tomatoes
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
in a package or strawberries they have
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
they have machine that can take them all
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
apart and then put them into the
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
digester so according to the manager
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
that I went to because I wanted to
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
understand like you practically how this
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
works he said they just dump everything
 
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:01.940 align:start position:0%
into these totes packages everything
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
agricycle comes through once a week they
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
dump the totes into their
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
thingy the collecting truck they put the
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
totes back down on the landing dock the
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
people at Hannaford spray them out and
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
then they just start all over again
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question I'm going
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
to follow up now go ahead follow up okay
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
and so what about for example you
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned hospitals so most of that
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
waste is going to be stuff that the
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
patients don't eat it's just play
 
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
patients don't eat it's just play
scrapings

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
scrapings
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
how does does that work the same way
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
I will admit that I didn't talk to a
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
hospital I had intended to but I didn't
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
get that far I mean they just a lot of
 
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
it also comes in cafeterias I think they
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
would just scrape the uh the food into
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
uh into
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
um uh you know collection location I
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
will say that we have a representative
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh of the health care industry on the
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
working group because I thought it would
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
be really important to have their uh
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
voice and you know we reach consensus on
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
that bill and and she didn't vote uh
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
raise particular concerns okay I'm sorry
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
one one follow one more one more go
 
00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:18.830 align:start position:0%
one one follow one more one more go
ahead

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
and so last last question is so I'm I'm
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
the grocer I get or or whoever and I
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
only can get rid of one ton I still got
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
half a ton left
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
what happens with that other half the
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
time I guess whatever you do with the
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
rest of your waste you probably take it
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
to the landfill I mean I think this is
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
the and I thought we prohibited the land
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
no no so this is the this is the trick
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
here the trick is that if you have an
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
alternative facility that has adequate
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
capacity then you're required to use
 
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
that facility just dispose of the waste
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
if there's not a facility either within
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
the whatever we decide you decide is the
 
00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
the whatever we decide you decide is the
parameter

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
parameter
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
and those facilities can't take your
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
waste then you just do with it whatever
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
you would have done with it otherwise so
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard somebody call this like a
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
field of dreams I mean you're setting up
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
a scenario where you know you you have
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
the waste if there's a facility
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
available to take it then you are
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
required to get rid of it and then if
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's not then you're not
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much ma'am sure
 
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.370 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much ma'am sure
representative

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:40.220 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
you've spoken a lot about the group
 
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.570 align:start position:0%
you've spoken a lot about the group
agricycle

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
agricycle
 
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.289 align:start position:0%
agricycle
um

00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me from just hearing you
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
talk about them they're picking up from
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
different Hannafords and taking it to
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
Maine correct okay
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
however if they're taking it to Maine in
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
your in say Lebanon New Hampshire that's
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
more than 50 miles correct so how would
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
that uh work because if we're limiting
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay we're not limiting the mileage on
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
where the food can go what we're doing
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
is if you're if you're in Lebanon an
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
agricycle is here and it's 150 miles
 
00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
agricycle is here and it's 150 miles
away

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know there may be other places
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
besides the agricycle well let's just
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
say we only have agricycle you're under
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
no uh duty to have to bring your food to
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
agricycle however
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know if you make like Hannaford I
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
guess throughout the Northeast has a
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
relationship with agricycle and they
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
just come and they pick it up and then
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
they bring it to Maine that's just the
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
way it works for them
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that but but as I say
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
the the limitation is you don't have to
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
get rid of your waste if there's not a
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
place for you to do it within 50 miles
 
00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
or 20 or 30. as I said in Maine I mean
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts they had no limitation
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh thank you madam chair
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
um the other question I have is is say
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
there is something within the 50 mile
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
radius that would like this food waste
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
um but agricycle who is taking it 150
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
miles away has a contract
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
how would you mitigate that because
 
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to put the food closer
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
to minimize the carbon footprint how
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
would this into would this interfere
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
with the contracts How would how would
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
we look at that well
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
um according to
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
my other source which was Hannaford
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
according to them they look at the food
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
waste reduction hierarchy and what they
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
want to do first of all is get the food
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
to the hungry and so they initially you
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
know work with food banks and Farmers to
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
get that number down and after that then
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
they they
 
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
they they
um

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
they work with somebody who can take it
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
and and compost it or digest it I I also
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
just want to point out here that you
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
know if there's enough food waste to
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
support a digester more composting
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
facilities at farms that sort of thing
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's a business generator and that
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
would bring the infrastructure in closer
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
which would reduce your haulage costs
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
and the carbon footprint and reduce
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
let's face it what's going into our
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
landfills so that we can preserve our
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
capacity representative Bixby yes I was
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to ask if this would create a
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
business opportunity for New Hampshire
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
business New Hampshire rights who wanted
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
to start businesses but I believe the
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative just answered that thank
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
you which is the point of my next bill
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
yeah but anyway any other questions from
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
very thorough testimony and introduction
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill we really appreciate it okay
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
I'd like any other additional questions
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer them thank you
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to call Michael Nork
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
from nhdes
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
but put your mic on thank you good
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chairman members of the
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
committee my name uh for the record is
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
Michael Nork I'm with the solid waste
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at New Hampshire
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 300
 
00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.630 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 300
um

00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill as we see it is
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
to discourage disposal of food waste
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
and encourage its diversion to more
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
preferable management through feeding
 
00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:12.859 align:start position:0%
the hungry feeding animals
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
composting anaerobic digestion and
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so that's not
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
going into a landfill or an incinerator
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
although we are not taking a position on
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
this bill we do support the intent of
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
and we do wish to provide the committee
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
with some information and express two
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have with the bill as
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
um first of all I think it's important
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
to note that this kind of policy has
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
been implemented in other New England or
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually other Northeastern states
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
including New York
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
and Vermont
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so this this legislation tracks
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
fairly closely with how those bills
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
started some of those bills started
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
which with with similar thresholds and
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
have ratcheted them down over time but
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that this kind
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation has been implemented in
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
other states it has been shown to
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
encourage development of infrastructure
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
for management of food waste alternative
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
management other than landfilling or
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
incineration there's been a flurry of
 
00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:18.380 align:start position:0%
investment in other states for
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
building composting infrastructure
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion infrastructure and
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
also increasing networks for Food
 
00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
also increasing networks for Food
donation

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
donation
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and for New Hampshire Department of
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as was mentioned
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
by representative evil we have recently
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
issued a solid waste management plan
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
food waste diversion is an identified
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
priority in that plan
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it's an important strategy for
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
decreasing the amount of waste that we
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
send to landfills according to the EPA
 
00:37:52.569 --> 00:37:52.579 align:start position:0%
um they have estimates that up to 24 of
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
MSW which is Municipal Solid Waste
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's the basically although it's
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
called Municipal Solid Waste it's
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
actually waste that's generated by the
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
community at large so it could be
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses so the estimate
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
from the EPA is that 20 up to 24 of the
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
MSW stream Nationwide is food waste and
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
while MSW is not the only thing that
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
ends up in a landfill it is the largest
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
component of the disposal stream so
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
making a dent in food waste can make a
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
dent in the amount of waste that we send
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
um we don't have exact data and how much
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
food waste was disposed of in New
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we did use the epa's
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
estimate of 24 we applied it to uh the
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
total amount of MSW that Granite Staters
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
sent to disposal in 2021 so we estimate
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
that there could be up to 180 000 tons
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
of food wastes going to landfills at
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
least based on 2021 data so that's a
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
significant amount and if we can make a
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
dent in that we can it's it's an
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
important strategy to consider because
 
00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
important strategy to consider because
the

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
um legislature in the past couple years
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
as representative Ebel noted has updated
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
the disposal goal for the state the
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
disposal reduction goal which is an RSA
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
149 M2
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
to reduce disposal of MSW and c and d by
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
25 by the year 2030 and 45 percent by
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
the year 2050. so again MSW is one of
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
the components of that goal and food
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.859 --> 00:39:33.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
you know as I mentioned this kind of
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
policy has been implemented in other
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
states it has shown uh promise in terms
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
of being able to incentivize development
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
of new infrastructure to manage food
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
waste that's one of the things that
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
we've identified as a need in New
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't currently have robust
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
composting infrastructure or anaerobic
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
digestion or we do have food networks
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
food you know recovery networks but this
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
kind of policy has shown in other states
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
to really incentivize development of
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
those kinds of systems
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and so we think that this could have
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
similar impacts for New Hampshire
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
however the department does have two
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as currently
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
written number one
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the bill uh would impose new
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on DES in terms of
 
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.010 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on DES in terms of
regulating

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:24.020 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
the food
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
service industry uh you know other kinds
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
of large food waste generators as
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative people mentioned like
 
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:34.700 align:start position:0%
grocery stores hospitals
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
food manufacturers and food processors
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
these are these are entities that
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
currently we don't regulate so this
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
would be an expansion of our
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and so when considering
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
this we estimate that we would probably
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
need at least one full full-time
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
equivalent employee to be able to
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
adequately implement this kind of
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
disposal ban however the bill doesn't
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
provide for that and and I do recognize
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
that this this committee is maybe not as
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
focused on the fiscal side of things and
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
this will probably go to the fiscal
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee but we did want to just raise
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
that as a consideration the second
 
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
concern we have is the 50 mile radius
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and we do note that that is more uh
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
more stringent than the kind of radius
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
that's implemented in similar bands in
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
um is typically they they have a 20 mile
 
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
um is typically they they have a 20 mile
radius

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
radius
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and as representative evil noted
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is the only one that
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any stipulation for
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
distance so basically any generator in
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts is required
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
to divert food waste
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
Vermont initially had a 20 mile radius
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
they initially started this in 2014. and
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
they slowly stepped it down over time
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
until 2021 when any generator in the
 
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
state is required to divert their food
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
waste so they they did start with a
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
20-mile radius but they slowly stepped
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
it down over time I'm just mentioning
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
that as as things that the committee
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
might consider in terms of implementing
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
policy for New Hampshire
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
um so I guess that's really that that
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
sums up the the comments that the
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
department had but if there are any
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
for the Department I'm happy to to field
 
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.670 align:start position:0%
for the Department I'm happy to to field
those

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
all right thank you madam chair thank
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh just a quick
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
question in the physical note in the
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
back here it has 97 000 for a a uh one
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
one employee is that in line with what
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on that if this goes
 
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.490 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on that if this goes
forward

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative Creighton
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
that that fiscal note was based on
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
information that we provided to LBA um
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
so that is that is the estimate that we
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
made cool
 
00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:52.069 align:start position:0%
made cool
okay

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
may I uh just just to clarify one point
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
on on I think it was representative
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
smart had uh comment about date labels
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry if I'm incorrected and who
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify that with
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
regard to the date labels my
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
well while New Hampshire Department of
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services may have food
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
safety regulations that apply in certain
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
contexts they are not I don't believe
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
that they have oversight over date
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
labels and I think that in general date
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
labels are largely up to the
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer there's sell by there's
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
Best Buy those don't always mean that
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
the food is inedible and there's also
 
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.190 align:start position:0%
the food is inedible and there's also
Federal

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
legislation the bill Emerson Good
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
Samaritan act which does provide
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
liability protections for individuals or
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
businesses that want to donate food in
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
good faith so I'm not sure exactly the
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know all the ins and outs but I know
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
that there are certain liability
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
protections and that
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
food date labels aren't always the be
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
all end-all usually a better indicator
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
is using your nose to see if it smells
 
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.630 align:start position:0%
is using your nose to see if it smells
bad

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
bad
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
but but I understand that some
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
businesses may have concerns about
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you know whether something isn't
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
effect edible or not
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Morse
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
question on um just going off of that a
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more would it be possible for
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
farmers and composters to just enter
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
into food gathering with a contract so
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
that they agree you know they're not
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
going to eat expired food and get sick
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
and Sue it would be strictly for
 
00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
and Sue it would be strictly for
composting

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Morse I
 
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Morse I
think

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.829 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
that that is possible and and I'm not a
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I don't really understand all
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs of like those kinds of
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
legal agreements but
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I think in general what would happen
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
is if food waste was diverted to a farm
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
it probably
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
would be the kind of stuff that would be
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
for composting anyway it wouldn't really
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
be like you wouldn't want to send stuff
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
to a farm and then have the farm sorted
 
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
to a farm and then have the farm sorted
out

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh you really want to get food that's
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
edible to the place where it can be used
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and most Farms or
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
composters are going to take stuff
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
that's kind of already mixed with other
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
you know petressable waste it's not
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
really going to be in a condition that
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
is is edible
 
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.510 align:start position:0%
is is edible
um

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
question but
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
um so you said that Vermont initially
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
started with a 20 uh 20 mile radius and
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
then ratcheted that down but I wouldn't
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
in terms of making him you you're saying
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
that they're made it more stringent so I
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
would assume that they increased the
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
mileage until the point where it wasn't
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
because 50 miles is stricter than 20.
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I may have
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
misspoke I think
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
let me let me back up and just say that
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
the intent with these kinds of bills is
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
to have implementation delayed so you
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
have a year two or three before the food
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
waste disposal ban goes into effect
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
so that it allows time for
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be developed that's
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
what happened in Vermont that's what
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
happened in in Massachusetts they they
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
basically said we're going to do this
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to start until such
 
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:34.130 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to start until such
date

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
and it gave it gave a signal to the
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
industry saying okay there's going to be
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
a demand for my services so I should
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
start investing and looking for
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
opportunities to start a business in
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
such and such state
 
00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:46.970 align:start position:0%
such and such state
um

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
so so it gives that time to allow for
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
development of infrastructure
 
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.630 align:start position:0%
development of infrastructure
and

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
with Vermont where I may have misspoke
 
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
with Vermont where I may have misspoke
was

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
they they ratcheted down not the
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
distance so much as the the threshold so
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
they started with two tons per week then
 
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
one time the the next year
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
then I forgot maybe been two-thirds of a
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
ton or half a ton or something like that
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
so they slowly over time over the course
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
of like six years
 
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.050 align:start position:0%
of like six years
um

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
ratcheted down the threshold
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
for total tonnage generated by an entity
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
um meanwhile all along there was a 20
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
mile radius until 2021 when they got rid
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
of that because the presumption was
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
after that amount of time had passed
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
there would be enough infrastructure to
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
support kind of Statewide uh
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's a version of food waste from any
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
generator regardless of the the
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
threshold or the the amount that that
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
facility generates
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
so in Vermont currently they don't have
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
a tonnage threshold and they also don't
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.569 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning I'd like to call
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
Reagan investment from nrra to come and
 
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.849 align:start position:0%
Reagan investment from nrra to come and
speak

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
my name is Reagan Bissonnet and I'm the
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
executive director of the Northeast
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association we are a
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
recycling non-profit we work with 85
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
percent of the communities in New
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help them manage their own
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
recycling programs
 
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.290 align:start position:0%
recycling programs
and

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we helped communities recycle
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
enough material that we were able to
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
return over 3.8 million dollars to New
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities to help them
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
improve their recycling programs from
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
the sale of their recyclables the
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
benefit of that recycling actually also
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
equivalent to removing almost 21 000
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
cars from the road for an entire year so
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire are
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
recycling and having a very positive
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
impact on the environment here
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
so the Northeast resource recovery
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
Association does not take a position on
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
any proposed legislation but I did want
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
to share some information just from the
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
perspective of how this type of
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
legislation might impact New Hampshire
 
00:49:37.319 --> 00:49:38.890 align:start position:0%
legislation might impact New Hampshire
municipalities

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:38.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll also note that I'm a member of the
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group along with
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative evil and I also served on
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee of that group that
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
focused on Recycling and composting when
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
we were working to advise the Department
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services on the
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
development of its current Solid Waste
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
Management plan
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
so as you already heard food waste is a
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
very large component of the municipal
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
household waste that's disposed of in
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and across the country so
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
there's a number of benefits for
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
communities to reduce that waste one of
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the things I'd like to add is that it's
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
very expensive for communities to
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
dispose of trash in New Hampshire in the
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
Northeast we have the highest cost of
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
disposal for Waste going to landfills or
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
incinerators compared to the entire rest
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the country and that is in part
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
because we have the least amount of
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
available space for building new or
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
expanding landfills we also have a high
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
water table relative to many other
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
places so it leaves less opportunities
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
for digging new landfills so it really
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
is quite an expense for communities to
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
dispose of waste and anything that can
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
be done to help communities reduce the
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
amount of waste that they need to throw
 
00:50:59.579 --> 00:51:00.370 align:start position:0%
amount of waste that they need to throw
away

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:00.380 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
can it help them save money
 
00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.370 align:start position:0%
can it help them save money
so

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
as I think representative Ebel already
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
noted the current Solid Waste Management
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
plan certainly
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
encourages uh ways to reduce the amount
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
of food waste that's being disposed of
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
and so certainly a disposal ban like
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
this was contemplated as the working
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
group was considering ways in which uh
 
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature might consider
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
addressing food waste since it is such a
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
large component of our our waste that
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're disposing
 
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.290 align:start position:0%
we're disposing
um

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps more importantly from
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
the perspective of municipalities
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
anything that the state can do to
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
provide more opportunities for towns and
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
cities to uh dispose of food waste
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
through composting or anaerobic
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
digestion certainly has the opportunity
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
to help communities save money so one
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
specific example I'll give we actually
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
hear from many of our members that they
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
are interested in ways that they could
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
compost or otherwise divert their food
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
waste but there are some limited
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities here in New Hampshire
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
there are a few communities that
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually compost their food waste on
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
site the city of Lebanon does so and
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
also the town of Hollis and those
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
programs have been pretty popular with
 
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.309 align:start position:0%
programs have been pretty popular with
residents

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon actually found that
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
through a pilot program they've actually
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
been composting
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
food waste from uh Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
Medical Center and also Dartmouth
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
College for many years and they began a
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
pilot program to also divert and compost
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
food waste from residents and what the
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon found from that pilot
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
project was that they were ultimately
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
saving about 30 percent
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of what it would cost them to
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
landfill that food waste versus
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
composting it so there were Financial
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
savings for the city of Lebanon and the
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
communities that it serves and
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
ultimately that pilot project was quite
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
successful and so they decided to make
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
that a more permanent project where
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
residents can bring their food scraps to
 
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
their facility for composting and they
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
have continued to take material from
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth collagen and Dartmouth
 
00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.730 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth collagen and Dartmouth
Hitchcock

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
in addition there are some communities
 
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:24.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that have access to
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
composting services so for example there
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
are communities on the Seacoast that
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
work with Mr Fox compost it's a company
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
based in Maine and you heard about how
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
generators can have those large totes
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
and so for example the town of Lee and
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
the town of Rye they work with Mr Fox
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
compost and basically residents can
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
bring their food scraps separated to the
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
transfer station put them in those big
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
totes and then Mr Fox compost can take
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
those totes and bring them to their
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
facility in Maine to compost that
 
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.890 align:start position:0%
facility in Maine to compost that
material

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.010 align:start position:0%
material
um

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
so you know even though we don't take a
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I just wanted to
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
to stress that to the extent that
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
this or other legislation can increase
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
markets or infrastructure for composting
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
food scraps or even um you know
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion of food scraps that
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately has the potential of really
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
helping communities in New Hampshire
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
have greater access to those markets so
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
that they can save money
 
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.130 align:start position:0%
that they can save money
um

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know certainly many communities do
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
encourage their residents to do backyard
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
composting and that's a great option
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I for example compost my food scraps
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
in my backyard but just last night I
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
discovered that the snowplow had
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
destroyed my compost bin because it's
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
next to my driveway and so it'd be very
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
convenient if my community actually
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
provided Municipal uh you know
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
composting services and certainly we get
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of inquiries from residents as
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
and that's all I wanted to share happy
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.089 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
testimony I call Clark courson
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
to come this morning before us and uh I
 
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.290 align:start position:0%
to come this morning before us and uh I
see

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
you are from collaborative Solid Waste
 
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:35.870 align:start position:0%
you are from collaborative Solid Waste
strategies

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
please put on your microphone
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.130 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
committee

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
as you can see not much west coast of
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
I am a co-founder and program director
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a non-profit in New Hampshire called
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
collaborative Solid Waste strategies
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
our goal is to
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
serve as a catalyst for new ways looking
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
outside the box for sustainable Solid
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
Waste strategy strategization
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the great problems that we
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire is that of
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
regionalization every town thinks that
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
their system is the best and they're not
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
going to listen to the neighbor because
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
they're competing with them for
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
temperature fees and so forth or the
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
reverse of that trying to get rid of
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
their garbage for the cheapest price
 
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
their garbage for the cheapest price
possible

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak to the specifics
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I was a lobbyist in this
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
state for 41 and a half years they
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
started in 1971.
 
00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:44.099 align:start position:0%
and during the course of that I learned
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
how to read a bill
 
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.690 align:start position:0%
how to read a bill
my

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
I have no objections to the bill is
 
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.750 align:start position:0%
I have no objections to the bill is
written

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
but I second the comments made by
 
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
Michael Nook of Des
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of distance
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
which is in in and in terms of how far
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
behind our state of New Hampshire has
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
fallen compared to other states he
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that there has been a
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we're just addressing this now why
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
do you know that
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
of the solid waste that goes to the
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
turnkey T4 operation of Rochester New
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes from Massachusetts every
 
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:36.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes from Massachusetts every
day

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of people aren't aware of that
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people aren't aware of the fact
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
that Vermont has had a solid waste study
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
plan since 2000 1994 or 1997 whatever it
 
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.270 align:start position:0%
plan since 2000 1994 or 1997 whatever it
is

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
and the last time a governor in this
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
state paid attention to this issue was
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
Gene Shaheen in 2003.
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
the the woman sitting behind me Karen
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
Ebel a representative from New London
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been the catalyst
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the general court in my opinion
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
but tackling this huge problem and it
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
really is the more you get into it the
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
more you realize it's a science because
 
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:18.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's food
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
nanograms of plastic in our bloodstreams
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
what's going into the landfills who's
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
transporting it the interstate
 
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.170 align:start position:0%
transporting it the interstate

Commission

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
the recovery and resource conservation
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
Act of 1976 which was
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
which was initiated by EPA
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
the more you get into this the more you
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
realize that this just isn't House Bill
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
300 is just not a bill it is a it is a
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
process it's not an event
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
and it has come about because of
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
Representative evil principally
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether she's capable of
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
blushing or not
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
so I I don't want to take up the
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
committee sign but I want to tell you
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative Solid Waste strategies is
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to work with this legislature to
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
try to come up with looking outside the
 
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.530 align:start position:0%
try to come up with looking outside the
box

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
box
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
not concentrating on landfills and
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
incineration but how can we contribute
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
that much less to the process as it
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
so you guys sit on a critically
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
important standing committee in This
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
and I take my hat off to you
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony I'll take
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr Colson any
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
coming and speaking with us this morning

Amherst and Milford that's Hillsboro
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
District 37. I'm here in support of HB
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
300 as a co-sponsor in an effort to
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
address what is one of the most uh
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
copious items in our waste streams and
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
that is food waste
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's heavy
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
it has purpose outside of our landfills
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
and it contributes to a large portion of
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
methane gas production once it ends up
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
in our landfills as the clerk to House
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 617 which was the study committee
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Ebel mentioned into
 
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.089 align:start position:0%
that representative Ebel mentioned into
2019

01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the house uh Ena
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee On Solid Waste I fully
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
support the desire to stop sending large
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
quantities of food to landfills our
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
preferences on food uh waste is to First
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
limit how much spoilage we actually do
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
have overage
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
um or waste in the first place but then
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
our responsibility is to move closer to
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
getting uh the food to those who need it
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
feeding animals
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
and then after all of those efforts are
 
01:01:22.859 --> 01:01:25.069 align:start position:0%
and then after all of those efforts are
exhausted

01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
exhausted
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
um then the usable food has gone to
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
those who benefit most and consider what
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
we do with that food waste and spoilage
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
or overage it might surprise you that
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
the food waste that food waste is so
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
heavy and dense
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
and we know it's costly to transport
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately to a would-be resting ground
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh whereby uh composting it and also
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
working towards our race reduction goals
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
is preferable
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
we can collectively support composting
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
which AIDS in the contribute uh
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
contribution of um reinfusing our soils
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
with nutrient nutrients
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
um as well as the composting process
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
there also has other methods too like
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion that help in dealing
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
with our food waste after
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
we've done all of the other food
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
hierarchy methods
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
well one ton of waste in uh food weight
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
may not seem like a lot we have heard in
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
countless testimonies before the house
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
CNA committees
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
that food grown and produced in the
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
United States
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
often does go to waste I know you've
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
heard some other statistics but roughly
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis 218 billion with a B
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in food waste
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
occurs each year in the United States
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
and of food grown
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the United States 30 percent of what
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
is grown and produced as a food
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
commodity ends up as waste before us
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
sending our food uh to a landfill
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
is our least preferred method of
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
disposal of the six options that we do
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
have and the time is right to do what we
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
can to keep our food hierarchy and
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
Recovery moving in the direction that we
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
know the U.S EPA prefers
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I've I know that you've heard from
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
Des in regards to that matter and I I do
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
urge the passage of HB 300 if I can also
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the other efforts that
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
had been mentioned by representative
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
smart I do know when you mentioned the
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
donation of food I had worked very
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
diligently on a an alternative method to
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um getting food to those who are hungry
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
and that was signed into law and that
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
was HB 500 it did
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
um work with what are called hassip food
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
safety protocols which I did work with
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS on and so long as the food had
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
comported with food safety regulations
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
prior to it being served it was able to
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
be then repackaged and repurposed into
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
usable portions that would go to
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
communities we're now seeing those
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
efforts underway in communities like
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
Great Bay Community College and others
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
so um those efforts are there I am a
 
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
so um those efforts are there I am a
small

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
I own chickens as well and so I do as
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
much as I can to get that food first you
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
know to my family or donate it and then
 
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
after that it goes to my hands and after
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
that then there's there's composting so
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that and I'm happy to
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
may have thank you representative Murray
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%

um I will be brief my name is Carol Foss
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
I am representing New Hampshire Audubon
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
where I am Senior advisor for Science
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
and policy
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
um we strongly support House Bill 300

um
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
because it reduces greenhouse gases
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
conserve space in landfills
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
supports the goals of New Hampshire's
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan and supports
 
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
the goals of
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency and
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture who are
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
reduce Weight Food waste going to
 
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
reduce Weight Food waste going to
landfills

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:35.930 align:start position:0%
landfills
um

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
as well Nationwide as you've heard it
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
creates jobs reduces food insecurity and
 
01:05:45.849 --> 01:05:45.859 align:start position:0%
saves money for communities
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to quickly address the
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions about food date labels
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
um they are very confusing some
 
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.210 align:start position:0%
um they are very confusing some
companies

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
have a sell-by date some have a use by
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
date some just have a date and you don't
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
know what it means
 
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.130 align:start position:0%
know what it means
um

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
some of the dates are addressing quality
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
and some are addressing safety and one
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
of our neighboring states I can't
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
remember which one I think it might be
 
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.829 align:start position:0%
remember which one I think it might be
Massachusetts

01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
has a bill before their current
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
legislature to standardize date labels
 
01:06:23.289 --> 01:06:23.299 align:start position:0%
so that it's clear to the consumer
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
whether it's a quality issue or a safety
 
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
issue and that may be something we'll
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
see how it goes with our neighbors but
 
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:33.740 align:start position:0%
that may be something that we want to
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
consider as well
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%

and I'd like to call Heidi tremario I
 
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.370 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to call Heidi tremario I
believe

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
from the conservation law Foundation
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you it's Heidi
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
tremarco I'm sorry I apologize for my uh
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
handwriting on the Forum that is my
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
error and you've also requested two
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
minutes yes I will keep it very short I
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
do we did submit our comments over email
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
but I have copies here if the committee
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
would you like them you pass it around
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
so thank you chair and members of the
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee to keep it very brief because
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the plea the most of the points have
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
already been made clf also strongly
 
01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
supports this bill for the reasons that
 
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
you've heard that it will support
 
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
you've heard that it will support
diversion

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
diversion
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard and I have a
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
reference in our comments that EPA does
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
estimate that up to 24 of the waste in
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
our landfills is food waste so this is a
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
great great chunk of waste that you
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
could tackle and reach and help reach
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
our diversion goals which as you heard
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
is to get to 25 diversion by 2030.
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
um and uh these goals were reinforced in
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
the state's Solid Waste Management plan
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
which was just updated this fall and
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
this diversion would support those goals
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
specifically goals one three and four in
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that plan
 
01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
also in helping with food insecurity it
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
would assist in the goal seven which is
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
to address environmental justice
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
and so we strongly support the bill I'm
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I also just
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to note on a personal note I
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
compost my food at the Lebanon
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
composting facility and I'm not 11 on
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
Resident but we drive our food waste
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
there and it's extremely convenient and
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
I could answer questions about how that
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
works for us thank you for your
 
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us this morning
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Bonnie Christie up to
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
testify this morning and um please if
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
you have something new to contribute
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
please do so if you have something that
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
has already been said we have heard that
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
I have some a slightly different
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
perspective to contribute and I think I
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
misspelled your name on the testimony
 
01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:08.570 align:start position:0%
misspelled your name on the testimony
sorry

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
no worries um Bonnie Christie I live in
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and I'm the chair of our waste
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
reduction committee
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my statement I
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
support this bill because it will help
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
to implement several of the goals of the
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Solid Waste Management
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
plan which we've heard quite a bit about
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
this morning goal one of that plan is
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
Source reduction you don't create waste
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
you don't have to manage it you don't
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
have to pay people to manage it you
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay tipping fees at the
 
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.870 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay tipping fees at the
landfill

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
um in Hopkinton this is a big expense
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
for us we have seen a 20 increase in our
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
waste over the last decade and our
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
population has only grown by five
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
percent our tipping fees are going up
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
and up and up every year
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't expect that to go down so
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is a concern for us how can we
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
reduce our waste costs
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
so goal number one of the statement
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan reinforces the
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
original hierarchy in our waste
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
reduction methods of putting Source
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
reduction at the top and getting away
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
from the landfilling and incineration
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
goal two is about toxicity and then this
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
brings us to goal three of the plan
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
which HB 300 addresses
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
even with the best efforts we'll always
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
have some waste that we produce and we
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
try once we do Source reduction we try
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
to divert the waste that we can't avoid
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
the two methods of that are generally
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
Recycling and composting
 
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.310 align:start position:0%
Recycling and composting
um

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
I I'll also note people have mentioned
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
methane as a problem we're very
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
concerned about that in Hopkinton
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
because we know that methane is a far
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 and
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
landfills are the third largest source
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
in our country of of methane after oil
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
and gas systems and livestock raising
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
so the two ways that we have worked in
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
most municipalities work to to divert
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
their waste as I said Recycling and
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
composting recycling has done really
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
well in our town we have
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
generated in in about a decade 400 and
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
over 438 thousand dollars in Revenue
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've avoided over four hundred and
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in tipping fees
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we've kept 6 700 tons of waste out
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
of landfills and incinerators
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
so this if you calculate the 24 percent
 
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.890 align:start position:0%
so this if you calculate the 24 percent
of

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
Municipal solid waste that you've heard
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
EPA is that's what they estimate for us
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a savings of sixty nine
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
if we were to divert our food waste
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
so um you've also heard that there are
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
pilot programs that are springing up
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire Lebanon and our
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
neighbor New London
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the Hopkinton waste reduction
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee recruited a test group of
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
residents to separate out their food
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
scraps from their household waste waste
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
and they had an average diversion rate
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
of 45 percent
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
which we were very surprised and pleased
 
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:38.990 align:start position:0%
which we were very surprised and pleased
with

01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we began a collaborative program
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
with worksong Farm which is one of our
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
local csas and the composting
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
Association of Vermont it's called turn
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
your slops into crops
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
and the way it works is the CSA members
 
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
bring their food scraps when they pick
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
up their share every week they drop them
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
off they go home with a new clean bucket
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
and start all over again and the purpose
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
of this program is to enrich the soil at
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
worksong farm so Dan kilrain who owns it
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
is loving this program it's been so
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
successful he has opened it up to the
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
General Public
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is great
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
people are always amazed at how much
 
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:25.820 align:start position:0%
weight they they find food scraps
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
produce in their household waste
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we think that composting and I know
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
this is that this bill addresses more of
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
a vision of commercial composting but we
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
think if that can get started and
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
trickle down to a local level it can be
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
a huge help to municipalities we know
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton would welcome it
 
01:13:49.739 --> 01:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton would welcome it
um

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
and we also know that if we could have
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
regionalized composting that would
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
capitalize on efficiencies and produce
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
more effective results and that also
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
addresses goal number five of the state
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan which is to
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
create new markets for for Waste
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
diversion waste related so that's pretty
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
much it I'm happy to answer any
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions I did submit my testimony
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
online and I have a couple of hard
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.110 align:start position:0%
online and I have a couple of hard
copies

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
copies
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you would you send a hard copy up
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
to our clerk here that would be very
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you I have no more
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
pink cards does anybody else wish to say
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
anything about this
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will go ahead and close
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%

my name is Karen Ebel I represent
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 7 which is New London

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%

amendment
foreign

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to the solid waste management fund which
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
was created by the legislature uh last
 
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.010 align:start position:0%
was created by the legislature uh last
year

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.390 align:start position:0%
year
um

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
I think you've heard an awful lot about
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
composting at this point so I uh I won't
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
go through all of the benefits of doing
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
more composting as part of this hearing
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to point out that this
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
is a quite a simple in my opinion
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill it's here before
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
this committee for policy reasons
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that is that we're suggesting that
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
we make a slight a couple of tweaks to
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
the to the terms of the solid waste
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
management fund
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
um in particular now that you've perhaps
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
heard all you ever want to hear about
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
the benefits of composting
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
um the the solid waste
 
01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.130 align:start position:0%
um the the solid waste
um

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group have had
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
discussed this in great detail and
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
because we're really
 
01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:04.820 align:start position:0%
interested in promoting the concept of
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
composting in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that were described
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the previous hearing we thought that
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
the language in the solid waste managed
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
fund statute should be tweaked slightly
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
and in the bill it's line 12 just to say
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
that assuming we get the appropriation
 
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
which the finance committee will be
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
considering 50 percent should be given
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
to prioritize projects associated with
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
the reduction in diversion of food food
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
waste and organic waste for until June
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
30th 2027.
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the primary reasons the
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh that the bill is here the other
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
um reason is just to expand the uh
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
manners in which money can flow into the
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
fund through the whole flurry of
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
activity last year with um through the
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
amendment process what what was left
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
here was that the management fund could
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
take money from the Environmental
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency but there was nothing
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
else noted and I want to thank Des for
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
their technical assistance in
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
identifying this issue because obviously
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
if we want to be able to get gifts
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
donations legislative appropriations of
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
any of that anything of that nature
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
we've got to make provision for it in
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
the bill so that's what the earlier uh
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
part of it is
 
01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:48.290 align:start position:0%
part of it is
um

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
as was noted by Reagan B sinat when she
 
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:54.260 align:start position:0%
was talking about the benefits to
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities we want to help develop
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
more of an infrastructure in our state
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
we and one of the things that will help
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
motivate this is if we use some of the
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that I hope we receive
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
through the budget process
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
using part of the proceeds from the fund
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
to help promote infrastructure I know
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
that you could also be using these
 
01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:24.380 align:start position:0%
monies for for Education
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
Outreach there's any number of uses and
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
I also want to note that the way this
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
fund was created is that municipalities
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
and businesses can afford themselves of
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
the matching grant program which would
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
also help businesses especially smaller
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
ones move forward to try to help develop
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure not just for com posting
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
although we certainly have that as a a
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the first couple of
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
years of the fund but also for other uh
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
recycling Source reduction and diversion
 
01:21:01.199 --> 01:21:04.490 align:start position:0%
recycling Source reduction and diversion
opportunities

01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
the only other thing really that I want
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
to add here is that one of the looming
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
issues that I had talked about before
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
with regard to Solid Waste Management in
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
also is reflected in the solid waste
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
management plan and I've noted that in
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony that establishing a
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
reliable source of funding for solid
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
waste management is incredibly important
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
in our state and that one of the ways of
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
achieving this is the solid waste
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
management fund
 
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.310 align:start position:0%
management fund
and

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:50.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping that assuming you as the
 
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
policy committee agree with the changes
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the statute within the fund we can
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
promptly get it over to the finance
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
committee where
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
um it can be discussed as part of the
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I thank you very much and if you have
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be happy to answer
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative evil any
 
01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:10.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you for
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh there was some
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony online that suggested that the
 
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
phrasing of the sourcing of the fund
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
sourcing might be a little bit ambiguous
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh just to clarify so it says
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
any Source including gifts donations of
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
money grants legislative approach
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and any other matching
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
fund and incentives from the United
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
States Environmental Protection Agency
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
or other agencies that are targeted for
 
01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
making grants within with this with this
 
01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
section uh and is the
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the the
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
um Environmental Protection Agency
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
incentives from the Environmental
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
Protections Agency part might be
 
01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
governing all of the parts before that
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
and uh I was wondering if you would be
 
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
willing to have an amendment that would
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh clarify that so that the
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency would
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
count as just one rather than uh the
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
complete funding I would be more than
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
happy to put any amendment in that
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
allows this fund to get money from
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
virtually everywhere including Manna
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
From Heaven so if you if you want to
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
work on that
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'd be happy to work with you
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
I I did want to say uh one thing about
 
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:39.980 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency the
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
funding that folks were really excited
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
about coming through the infrastructure
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
act for recycling activities at the rate
 
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
of I think about 55 million dollars a
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
year the guidelines had not been issued
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
at the time this bill at the time that
 
01:23:59.290 --> 01:23:59.300 align:start position:0%
the fund was created
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of us were hopeful
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the money from that from the EPA
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
could go into this fund
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
although the guidelines can change over
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
time the initial guidelines that came
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
down from EPA do not permit states to
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
apply for the funding and then use the
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
funding as a sub-grant program and and
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
director wimsat could answer more
 
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:26.900 align:start position:0%
questions on this so at this point
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
unless the guidelines change that EPA
 
01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
recycling money is not uh available for
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
sadly thank you any other questions from
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank you for your
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill okay thank you
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
and I'll Now call up Mike wimsat
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike Wimsatt my
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
service director of the waste management
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
division for the New Hampshire
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to come
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
before you to testify on House Bill 462
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
this morning
so

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
I know you've heard a lot about Organics
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
and you've heard a little bit about the
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan and the solid waste
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
management fund this morning so I'll
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
just sort of summarize the Department's
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
testimony as follows the fund was
 
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
established as uh representative evil
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned back you know in the last
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
session of the legislature in order to
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
provide matching grants to improve uh
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
for projects that would improve waste
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
reduction and waste diversion to really
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
help us improve Recycling and and to
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
achieve our waste reduction goals and uh
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
last fall we issued a update to our
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan that has a
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
host of goals and strategies and actions
 
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
to to try to in large part to try to
 
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
achieve that disposal reduction goal and
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
I think it's really clear to us that
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
this this fund is going to need to play
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
a significant role in achieving those
 
01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.570 align:start position:0%
a significant role in achieving those
goals

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
goals
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
um so you've heard an awful lot about
 
01:26:17.159 --> 01:26:17.709 align:start position:0%
um so you've heard an awful lot about
um

01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh food waste and organic waste and
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
composting this morning so I won't
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
review that my let my litter of
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
testimony does talk about that a little
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
bit we we absolutely feel that you know
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
because as you've learned this morning
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you didn't already know it food waste
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
and Organics waste constitutes a really
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the MSW the
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
municipal solid waste that gets disposed
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
of here in our state working on that and
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
making progress on on diverting and
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
reducing that waste is a really
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
important activity so we completely
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
support this uh effort to uh
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
um you know put some funding into the uh
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management fund and to
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
Target you know at least 50 percent of
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
those funds toward food and organic
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
waste reduction we don't take it we're
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
not taking a position with respect to
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
where the money ought to come from
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's we leave that to the legislature
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office to sort that
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
out but for our part it is true that the
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
fund was created last year and does not
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
have any funding in it so it's hard for
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
us to be effective with it if we don't
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
have any uh any funds to work with and
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll just open up to any
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions be glad to entertain questions
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any any
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I have a
 
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I have a
question

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
so part of this two million dollar
 
01:27:30.179 --> 01:27:32.030 align:start position:0%
so part of this two million dollar
appropriation

01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
would go to paying that full-time FTE of
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
to to oversee composting or or
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
well a recycling program sure well it
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
would actually an important to
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
understand Des has a lot of experience
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
giving out money right because we we
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
operate two State revolving funds we've
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
been administering millions of dollars
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
in arpa funds and one thing we've
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
learned is that it takes a little bit of
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
personnel and money to to get give money
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
out and we've got a lot of folks looking
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
over our shoulder about how we do that
 
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
about how we go about that and it's
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
important that we do it carefully and
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
and in compliance with the law and in
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
compliance with any provisions in the
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
case of like the arpa funds we have
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
specific Federal requirements we need to
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
comply with so yeah it's certainly true
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
we do need to to have a position that
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
could oversee that it would not be
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
specifically for food and organic waste
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
we would see it as a position that would
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
oversee among other things
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
advertising uh competition for that
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
grant funding making those grants and
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
then administering those grants after
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
they've been awarded so that that and as
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
we as we read it we understand that you
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
know a portion of those funds would be
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
available to to make sure that we did
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.199 --> 01:28:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
I had another question I now I'm drawing
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
a blank so thank you for your testimony
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I representative Bixby yeah I'd
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
just like to follow up on uh
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron's question because
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you quite got the exact
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
gist of it in the previous in the
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
testimony on SB on the HB 300 uh there's
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note on that which is basically
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ninety seven thousand dollars for
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
one person who would be necessary in
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
order to uh oversee the uh the programs
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
under s HB 300 and the ques I think
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent representative Aaron's
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
question was would that position be able
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
to come out of the appropriation in HB
 
01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
to come out of the appropriation in HB
462.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
462.
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's not clear to me I I I'm
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
not sure that's the case
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I didn't address your
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
question properly follow up sure so uh
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
it may in fact be necessary for us to
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to uh see that there
 
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriation attached to uh
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
HB 300 to cover the position that it
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
would require in order to oversee it
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that may be true I mean I'm
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
not commenting on whether the Bills
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
should be amended or not but I but again
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
to answer the question very directly I
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that funding appropriated to
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management fund would be
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
available to create a position to
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
administer other programs right and and
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
I I think the point of uh of this
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
question is we want to make sure you
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
um resources to do both of these bills
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
right and if we need to do something
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
additional to one of them in order to
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that happens we want to be
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
able to do it understood thank you
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bixby and
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying my question
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
um actually I do remember what I wanted
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
to ask you was
 
01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:03.500 align:start position:0%
um with the
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
administration of this two million
 
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.020 align:start position:0%
dollar fund
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you see the need to put together
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
any uh further rules for managing this
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
fund or do you have those in place based
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
on what was passed last year because I
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't know we do not currently have
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
rules but we generally if we are going
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
to administer an ongoing grant program
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
using State funds we would develop rules
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
to to govern how those how those funds
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
are administered
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to that do you have
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
an idea of time frame of when those
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
rules would be established
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh typically we try to
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
a lot for rule making is around about
 
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
six months from the start of the
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process I think there would
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
be a few months in advance of that
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
developing those we try to keep rules
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
related to making grants as simple as
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
possible one advantage we have is that
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
we do administer a number of Grant
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
programs either using federal or state
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
funds so we kind of have a template for
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
how we can do that so I I would
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate that you know in six to nine
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
months we could probably develop rules
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
for something like that thank you very
 
01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
for something like that thank you very
much

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to call Representative
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
Murray to testify
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair once again for the
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Megan Murray I
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Amherst and
 
01:32:39.719 --> 01:32:40.729 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Amherst and
Milford

01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
Milford
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
and under what I would consider the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
mentorship of Representative Ebel and
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
many others right here in house
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture I have set
 
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
out to understand the context nature of
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste here in New Hampshire
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
in one of the many
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities that I have had to hear
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Des are communities
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
in municipalities one thing I hear
 
01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.570 align:start position:0%
in municipalities one thing I hear
clearly

01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.639 --> 01:33:06.649 align:start position:0%
 
our

01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
um how anemic the funds are for our
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste division of Des and frankly
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
the monies and resources for Waste
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
diversion and recycling truly are
 
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:18.980 align:start position:0%
it's a little known fact that we do not
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily have dedicated funds to
 
01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.550 align:start position:0%
necessarily have dedicated funds to
always

01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
put forth the uh things that we would
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
like to do around waste disposal goals
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
to stand up programs or grants or assist
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
our local communities with programs to
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
help address the goal of food waste
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
reduction in our waste streams year over
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
year since I've begun this work here in
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
this committee municipalities have Long
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
Pine for help around tipping fees
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
and the sheer volume of what goes into
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
our landfills leaving municipality waste
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
budgets strained all while knowing that
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
trash is something every single one of
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
us produces and contends with
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
DS's Solid Waste division has stated the
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
true need for additional staff and
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
resources to keep going with the at
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
times overdue tasks the necessary work
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
of assessing assisting communities with
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
Recycling and waste diversion goals and
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
the efforts are related to them
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
this bill is strongly bipartisan and
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
adheres to our hierarchy goals and
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
offers help to communities towns and the
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
in much needed fiscal Appropriations to
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management fund so that
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
the work we need to do with and by our
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
communities can be done
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
I urge the support of HB 462 FNA so that
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can be stronger in our
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
work to address the recommendations out
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the solid waste working group and to
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
and uh with regarding to our Solid Waste
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%

01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
please put your uh microphone on thank
you

01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
so I won't I won't repeat what I already
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
shared about the importance of food
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
waste diversion and why that would be
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
helpful for communities to both save
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
money and make improvements in the
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
environment in New Hampshire what I
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
would like to share is that there is a
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
real need for communities in New
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to receive more technical
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
assistance and ideally grant funding to
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
support increasing their waste diversion
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
so the Northeast resource recovery
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
Association as I said we work with the
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
vast majority of communities in New
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we get many many endless
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
requests for resources that are
 
01:35:59.410 --> 01:35:59.420 align:start position:0%
available to them to help them
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
financially to increase their recycling
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
improve their recycling reduce the food
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
waste that they're disposing and while
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
our organization can provide a lot of
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
technical assistance through our staff
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
they're really very limited grant
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities available to these
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
communities so we we
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
routinely get requests for hey this is
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
something we want to do in our community
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
just recently a community reached out
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
and said we'd like to
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know start a composting program we
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
would like to share that information
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
with our residents we'd like to improve
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um how our residents are recycling
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
Plastics and they asked what Grant is
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
out there that can fund all of these
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
needs and I was able to share with them
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
that there are a handful of grants
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
available but that I wasn't aware of any
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
that would specifically help them with
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
that type of education and Outreach to
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
their residents so for example there are
 
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
a handful of federal grants that are
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
available for communities
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
federal grants are very difficult to
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
typically apply for and receive funding
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
for an administer
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
the an organization called New Hampshire
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
the beautiful does provide recycling
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
equipment grants for communities here in
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire up to a certain amount of
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
money and that is certainly helpful but
 
01:37:19.810 --> 01:37:19.820 align:start position:0%
again anything that the state can do to
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
support funds being available to support
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
communities more with increasing their
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
waste diversion with certainly be
 
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.669 align:start position:0%
waste diversion with certainly be
valuable

01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your
 
01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%

to our
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
welcome to environment and agriculture
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's mellor m-e-l-l-e-r
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Elizabeth Miller I am from
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
New London New Hampshire I'm a member of
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
the wage reduction committee and I have
 
01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
a written testimony
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of New Ham New London's
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
waste reduction committee and I am very
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill which seeks to
 
01:38:15.850 --> 01:38:15.860 align:start position:0%
amend the use of the
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
solid waste management to prioritize
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
food waste diversion in our state Our
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
Town funded a pilot program for food
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
scrap diversion via the revolving
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
recycling fund we had 20 households
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
participate and after three months they
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
have diverted 1.5 tons of food scraps
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
from the waste stream
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
as we seek to educate our community
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses about the state
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
of our landfills and the value of food
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
scrap diversion we have learned that
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
even these Endeavors have a cost
 
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.850 align:start position:0%
even these Endeavors have a cost
attached

01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
attached
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
thus we are now scrambling to find grant
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
money to help us educate the public as
 
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:01.850 align:start position:0%
money to help us educate the public as
well

01:39:01.850 --> 01:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
according to our 2021 annual Town report
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
Our Town hauled 2300 tons to mount
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
Carberry if we are to reduce this amount
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
by 25 percent then by 2030 we need to
 
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.350 align:start position:0%
by 25 percent then by 2030 we need to
divert

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
divert
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
575 tons
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
for small towns like ours this will take
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
a massive amount of effort and resources
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
to accomplish based on our tiny pilot
 
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.290 align:start position:0%
to accomplish based on our tiny pilot
program

01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
our waste reduction committee was
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have the supportive
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Public worth director who
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
offered to get the pilot program off the
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
ground using his own revolving fund
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
but as you know the markets in recycling
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
are frivolous and many municipalities
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
cannot count on sufficient resources to
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
fund town-wide Endeavors even on a small
 
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.250 align:start position:0%
fund town-wide Endeavors even on a small
scale

01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:57.260 align:start position:0%
scale
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
incentivizing economy of scale and
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
regionalization of food scrap diversion
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
is best accomplished at the state level
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
this amendment if funded would help
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities to meet the Statewide
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
goals in food scrap diversion alone or
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with neighboring towns
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
now we're very proud of our uh of our
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
pilot program which are we are now
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
moving into phase two if it's approved
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
by our town meeting
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh if there's any questions
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be him thank you any questions from
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
um could you just pass your written
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
next I would like to call Paul carpamil
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
did I sorry
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yeah well good
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
morning all good morning to you good
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
morning and uh apologize I'm kind of new
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
to this process so I prepared like a
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
whole like waste in nationally wasting
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I'll jump right in
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons I'm here I'm based
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
out of Amherst New Hampshire I was
 
01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
invited by my State Rep
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and I actually began a program uh
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
this past year and I'll tell you a
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
little bit about the history but really
 
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
what I'm here to talk about is how we
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
can start these Regional programs
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get more into details and
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
then and scale it so I started with
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
waste version back in 2021 just last
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
year with grow Nashua they're small
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
non-profit out of Nashua and they had
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
their their own food waste diversion
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
program we picked up food waste at
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
residential areas and I last summer was
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
able to obtain a grant from the
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
worldwide nature fund they're an NGO
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
that you may have heard of and they
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a food waste tracker
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
program food waste Warrior program
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
so I got the funding and I was able to
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
allocate it to a couple of Hollis
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and I got the
 
01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
necessary funding for setting up the
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
whole food waste program in their
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
schools and I got things like bins
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
refrigerators for sure for sharing
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
weight scales I actually partnered with
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
CET Center for ecological technology out
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
of on Northampton and they kind of
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
provide the know-how and so they
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
actually came in to the school and kind
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
of helped operationalize what we were
 
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.770 align:start position:0%
of helped operationalize what we were
doing

01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
thankfully I had a really good
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
Champion by the name of Tara happy she's
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
a third grade environmental teacher she
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
one environmental teacher of the year
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
last year and so she she got this and
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
she went ahead and took took what I gave
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
her and set up this great program and I
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
actually sent you guys a
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
a a a a a deck but a link to her food
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
tracker and she's been able to track
 
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
food milk and various components write
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
down right down to the to the numbers
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
and from that she's been able to kind of
 
01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
give feedback to the lunch food service
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
Personnel to how to tweak tweak things
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
so that is going extremely well at both
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
hes and as well as Hughes which is uh
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
I also got a contract in place with
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
Vanguard Renewables I originally started
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
with agricycle but I went to Vanguard
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
because they're much closer more
 
01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:50.149 align:start position:0%
because they're much closer more
reasonable

01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
um and we're actually using their
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
digester and Haverhill Mass
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and what I really like about it is
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
they actually take the credits the net
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
measuring credits after they yeah you
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
know so as you may know a digesters when
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
you take food waste mix it with
 
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.189 align:start position:0%
you take food waste mix it with
commodore

01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
commodore
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
turns into biogas which generates
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
electricity and goes on to the onto the
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
grid and so the net metering credits are
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
actually given to the Haverhill School
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
District now granted for going to our
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
school district but nonetheless it's a
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
great story
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
in addition I've been able to set up
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
Global classrooms I actually do a lot of
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
work with folks in heltonborg Sweden and
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'll talk a little bit more about them
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
helzenborg is a Pioneer in food waste
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're one of the top uh five European
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
green cities
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and I'll talk about them in a second
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
so actually have conducted a couple of
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
classrooms with sixth graders about how
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
food waste is handled in in various in
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
our country in their country things do
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
um I was also able to get Dan Velo of
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
our Shea rep in in Amherst New Hampshire
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
connected with the agricycle and he was
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
able to get a six-month
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
pilot going at the Amherst transfer
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
station which we're starting February
 
01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
station which we're starting February
2nd

01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
2nd
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
so given all this has gone on what we're
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
starting to to do to do is we're going
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
to look into create a regional project
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
through the srld Souhegan Regional
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
Landfill District this is Amherst
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
Brookline Hollis Mount Vernon about 28
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
000 residents about 3 000 students
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
and 10 schools and the great thing about
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
the srlds can be funded by both private
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
and public sourcing
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
um so this is a real great opportunity
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
to bring together local government
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
schools residents and businesses to to
 
01:45:45.609 --> 01:45:45.619 align:start position:0%
really serve as a model not only for our
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and for the rest of
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
and so the great part is I've kind of
 
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
got a really good handle on what needs
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
to be done in the schools for example I
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
provide stipends for some of the
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
teachers I would like to see us provide
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
stipends for Food Service Personnel so
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
they can create more sustainable meals
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know they look at the food tracker
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
and they can say okay well we threw away
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know chicken burgers
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so let's let's you know
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
tweak that let's bring in something else
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
let's bring in more local food
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the great part is because my
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
relationship with helzenborg I've got
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
some extremely good examples so these
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
guys just give you an example in five
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
years they partnered with 37 schools now
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
this is the city palsan board and they
 
01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
got the food numbers down from 40
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
percent down to 5.9 percent across 37
 
01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.290 align:start position:0%
percent down to 5.9 percent across 37
schools

01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
and you look at Sweden and if you look
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the latitude latitude wise they're up
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
north of Quebec so if they can do it we
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
can do it now granted I know we're not
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
so waiting but they've clearly shown us
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um a ways in which you do this to do
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
this so going forward I feel like by
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
setting up a a Model A Regional model it
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
achieves a bunch of different things one
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
achieves economies of scale
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
so we can buy food diversion
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in bulk
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
we can secure contracts with likes of
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
Vanguard more efficiently and Vanguard
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that by having cows
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
next to each other so they can Surface
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
the area
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
local composting uh Hollis already has
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
composting in place they've been doing
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
food version for two years under the
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
direction of Joan their DP Duffy
 
01:47:40.679 --> 01:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
direction of Joan their DP Duffy
director

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned we can set up a
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
central relationship with the Township
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
board so in conclusion in making it a
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
transition to more sustainable outcomes
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
if you think about what we're trying to
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
do in the state for
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
you know going to Electric
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
construction all sorts of things food
 
01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:04.139 align:start position:0%
waste is really a low-hanging fruit it
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
exists everywhere and we have the
 
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create regions in New
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sponsored by the state to have
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
local municipalities businesses and
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools play a pivotal part in driving
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
food version by funding food waste
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
production and recovery programs in the
 
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
community these groups can drive
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
economies of scale and educate the
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
public and private about food waste
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
doing this will help create a supportive
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
environment to encourage others to
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
contribute and entice those
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
yet involved to participate so thank you
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any any
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:44.870 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
committee

01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bixby so um it sounds
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
like uh your organization is doing a lot
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
of great stuff uh can you draw a very
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
clear connection between what you're
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
doing and how this bill will help it
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and so the idea would be
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
let's be a prototype for for you guys
 
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
and so you can then roll this out and
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
think of the Lakes Region think of the
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
North country you know you can't what
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
I've learned is you can't have like side
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
load environments you have to bring
 
01:49:16.739 --> 01:49:17.629 align:start position:0%
load environments you have to bring
together

01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
four or five six towns
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
get that economies of scale and just
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
drive down the cost and basically what
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at is is the reason why
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
we've gotten so much attention is
 
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
because the cost to haul away food waste
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
is starting to go down and so in the in
 
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
the in the town of Emerson Hollis it
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
costs ninety dollars now it went from
 
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
Seventeen to ninety to Holloway uh Hall
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
a one ton of food of General waste away
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
it costs the sau's 140 dollars to haul
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
away their waste and so I got a contract
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
for it's you know it's 275 a month
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
for all the food waste and so that's
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
certainly a kind of a green premium
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
we're over and above but eventually you
 
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
know you start getting these economies
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
of scan you start driving that cost down
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
and pretty soon you're going to have
 
01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:08.450 align:start position:0%
and pretty soon you're going to have
principles

01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
principles
 
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
coming to you and saying why am I
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
spending x amount of money generally so
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
why just give it to you guys and you
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
guys can do this food diversion project
 
01:50:18.770 --> 01:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
because it's actually almost cheaper and
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
socially environmentally so much better
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
and it's teaching the kids great lessons
 
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
that is how so one of the questions I
 
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm still kind of left with is well
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
and if you're doing so well why do you
 
01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
need help from the state
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
oh I mean I have oh why am I help them
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
say no why do you if if your program is
 
01:50:48.169 --> 01:50:48.179 align:start position:0%
doing so well right why does the state
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
need to do anything to help
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
oh well we need to get funding we need
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
to get funding I mean I have to go out
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
and write a grant and so if we get
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
reasonable funding I mean I had a mini
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
Grant from WWF it wasn't for a lot of
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
money it was like ten thousand we need
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
probably in the order of anywhere from
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to extrapolate here but for
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
the whole area
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
towns schools
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
about seven thousand something like that
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
right okay so it sounds like a follow-up
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like if you had funding
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
from the state then you could expand
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
this absolutely for a relatively low
 
01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
investment uh on the state's part
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes so so the idea would be get this
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
going and so if if if if this bill
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
passes you've now got a prototype that
 
01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
you can leverage absolutely and that's
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
the whole goal yeah drive down the
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
economy's efficiency of scale and just
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
make this a very teachable model and
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's really what it is
 
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.810 align:start position:0%
that's really what it is
yep

01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and and as a follow-up to
 
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's question I would
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
ask too so say you applied for a seven
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Grant from
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
Des that would have this program sure
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
what would you do with that money
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
well that money would go towards of
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
course buying the the the bins the
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
weight scales
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
um securing the the contract from the
 
01:52:24.729 --> 01:52:24.739 align:start position:0%
food Haller you know Vanguard
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
stipends for the teachers as well as
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
stipends for food service and not a lot
 
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
but reasonable amount because let's be
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
honest I mean teachers aren't there to
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
deal with food waste they're there to
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
teach but if it's done properly as we as
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
we're showing it can be involved sort of
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum right because food
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
waste if you think about it is physics
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
biology and chemistry right conversion
 
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the food waste into energy that's
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's mechanical energy the breakdown
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
of composting that's biology methane
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
into the atmosphere that's chemistry so
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
if you can integrate that into into some
 
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
degree into the curriculum
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
um then becomes more complementary so
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the money we spent on equipment
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh hauling away of the food waste
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous expenses like garbage bags
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
which believe it or not you end up
 
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and then probably some sort of a uh
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know like an uh a fee for someone to
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
come in and to administer it because the
 
01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
teachers don't have a ton of time to do
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
this right they need help so you're
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
going to need somebody that's going to
 
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
need to kind of roam work with the
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
teachers work with the food service
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh get things going the reason
 
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:41.699 align:start position:0%
I say all this is because they are doing
 
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
this in housing board and such a a
 
01:53:48.010 --> 01:53:48.020 align:start position:0%
beautiful way some you know they've
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
granted the city of hamiltonborg has a
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
fairly good sized staff but they have
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
people dedicated to to this and as a
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
result their their numbers are just gone
 
01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
down dramatically thank you any other
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I'm sorry yeah
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I was could
 
01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:12.659 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit more about in
 
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
particular about so food tracking that
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
you were referring to Yes it seems to be
 
01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
you were referring to Yes it seems to be
particularly

01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
um a lot of potential here right because
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
not only are you reducing the amount of
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
waste that that you're creating that's
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to save money uh but also for
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
schools for example especially at times
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
when prices are are as high as they are
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
now there's information that can be
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
gleaned from that process of food
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
tracking right so that that you can
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
order uh in ways for institutions that
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
will reduce costs in the front end in
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
terms of purchasing and I imagine that's
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that people could
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
apply for Grants to be able to set up
 
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
systems to do that so can you say a
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the specific
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
example of food tracking and how you see
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
that yes of being built up so I mean the
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
people on I mean Tara is she's a
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
environmental teacher so she's very
 
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
unique she's dedicated to what she's
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
doing so she spends a good amount of
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
time most other teachers would be doing
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
this but you could do a modified version
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the food tracker but the food truck
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
trackers there too is there because it's
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's basically manage what you measure
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
you can manage what you actually measure
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so if you know the breakdown of food
 
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
and milk and various components you can
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
then take that that sheet and work with
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
food service and they can in turn look
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
at that and say okay I'm realizing that
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
we served x amount of lunches today and
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
we had x amount of waste today why is
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that get more into detail and so and I
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
take this uh you know from my from my
 
01:55:48.010 --> 01:55:48.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues in Sweden they've actually
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
designed a program where they give
 
01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
certificates out to the Food Service
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel they actually can give them
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
certificates based on how well they
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
prepare sustainable meals meaning
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's keep me in there
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
but let's reduce it and get more
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
vegetables and things of that nature
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
reduce the CO2 footprint get more Local
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
Foods in make the food better you know
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
make the food better and and have less
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
waste and the kids and the food service
 
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
people really kind of all working
 
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
together and you start to get this this
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh symbiosis going and um before you
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
know it you know you're just seeing
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
waste numbers come dramatically down as
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
a result so all I'm going to say about
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
the food tracker is it's not meant to be
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
Overkill because again teachers don't
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
have all time to enter unless
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
information but things like the waste
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
per day then things like the waste per
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
student you kind of want to track some
 
01:56:48.609 --> 01:56:48.619 align:start position:0%
some key metrics but in general
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
WWF gave us the the funding because they
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
felt we could do about 14 percent less
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
year over year that was sort of the goal
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions from the
 
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.669 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions from the
committee

01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
welcome again and uh you have three
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I'll take less time
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
than that
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just here to say that our
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
town would welcome any funds from
 
01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
anywhere including Manna From Heaven as
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
as representative evil said I described
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
our work song Farm drop-off program they
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
can only take so much and manage so much
 
01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
at a farm if we were to expand this to a
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
town-wide program probably using our
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
transfer station we have no
 
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure our staff is pretty much
 
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
full-time busy with what they do already
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to compost there are
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways to do it but any
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
way you do it you have to do it right so
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
we would want to send our staff to the
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
main composting school we might need
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
more equipment we might need to fund
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
more staff hours so anyway we hope that
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
this would be a step in that direction
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much any
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
I have no more pink cards is there
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wishes to speak
 
01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
I have a question for representative
 
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
evil if I can sure if you would not mind
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
from representative Creighton
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
I actually don't have a good source for
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
Manna From Heaven but
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
I could work on it mana.com I think you
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
can go there
 
01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for for coming up
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
for an additional question and as I
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
listen to the testimony I'm just trying
 
01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:55.970 align:start position:0%
listen to the testimony I'm just trying
to

01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
clarify my head so it's two million
 
01:58:58.560 --> 01:58:59.629 align:start position:0%
clarify my head so it's two million
bucks

01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
and that Mill and that money comes from
 
01:59:01.739 --> 01:59:02.689 align:start position:0%
and that Mill and that money comes from
where

01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that the solicited grants or
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
is that state funding that goes into
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
that two million bucks okay so just to
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
um this is a two-step process so this is
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and you folks would
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
decide whether you agree with the tweaks
 
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
to the use of the management fund and if
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
you do and you make that recommendation
 
01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
for Passage would go to the house if the
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
house passes it then it would go to the
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee and then when it goes
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
um they would look at the overall budget
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
and they would decide how much money to
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
put into the fund so I'm when I wrote
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
the Bill I requested two million dollars
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
they could put in 5 million plus a
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
little Manna From Heaven or they could
 
02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
put in five hundred thousand dollars but
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
it would at this point be coming from
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
General funds unless I'm missing another
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
source that the finance committee might
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
be able to tap into
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
so again this is a policy decision on on
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
your part whether you support this
 
02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
amendment of the fund language and then
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
it would be the finance committee that
 
02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
determines whether and how much to fund
 
02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:26.149 align:start position:0%
determines whether and how much to fund
it

02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you very
 
02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you very
much

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
I am reading on the blue sheet first of
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
all any other people who wish to testify
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
because we have no more pink cards nope
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you okay we had on our
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
blue sheet eight people sign in uh in
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill and zero against and
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
said they support and two people who
 
02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
were against so
 
02:01:07.689 --> 02:01:07.699 align:start position:0%
with that I will end the hearing on HB
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%

02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:49.570 --> 03:04:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.090 --> 03:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'd like to bring our
 
03:04:55.550 --> 03:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
meeting to order for a house environment
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
and agriculture committee
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I will open the uh
 
03:05:04.490 --> 03:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB 494 which is relative to
 
03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
fees collected under the New Hampshire
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
fertilizer law
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
and with us this afternoon to introduce
 
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is representative Peter Bixby
 
03:05:15.290 --> 03:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
who is the Prime sponsor welcome
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you it's been
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
so long since I've been to this
 
03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
so long since I've been to this
committee

03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:05:23.630 --> 03:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Peter Bixby
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
Dover New Hampshire Stafford 13. of
 
03:05:30.889 --> 03:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
and this bill comes as a recommendation
 
03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh from the study committee that we did
 
03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
last fall on soil conditioners and
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
currently revenues from fertilizer
 
03:05:41.450 --> 03:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
product registrations lime product
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
registration and fertilizer tonnage fees
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
are deposited into the general fund
 
03:05:51.650 --> 03:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
and there is no guarantee that those
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
fees will get used to oversee the
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
fertilizer quality or even an
 
03:05:57.010 --> 03:05:57.020 align:start position:0%
agricultural purpose
 
03:06:02.330 --> 03:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
so this uh just a background on the way
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
some Financial stuff works in in the uh
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh probably not up to
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know what someone in Ways and Means
 
03:06:12.650 --> 03:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
would consider you know the appropriate
 
03:06:15.410 --> 03:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
academic standards but roughly speaking
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
the status of fees is not really
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
addressed in the state constitution uh
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
but the uh for taxes it's clear that
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
taxes need to be reasonable reasonable
 
03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
and proportional uh
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
and uh organizations that study uh
 
03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
governmental record Revenue like the tax
 
03:06:37.010 --> 03:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
Foundation distinguished between fees
 
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
and taxes in terms of uh what the base
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
of payers is for it and what the purpose
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
is uh taxes are for General General
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
governmental purposes uh and are
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
generally paid by a broadly defined base
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
fees are levied on a narrow base and
 
03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
they provide services for that base
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
 
03:07:02.760 --> 03:07:04.610 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
so

03:07:04.610 --> 03:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:06.889 --> 03:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
um one of the ways to ensure that fees
 
03:07:09.170 --> 03:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
get used for the intended purposes is to
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
put the revenue into a fund for that
 
03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
put the revenue into a fund for that
purpose

03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh currently that's not what that's not
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the uh funds from
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
the from the revenues from the
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
fertilizer fees uh currently those go to
 
03:07:25.969 --> 03:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
the general to the general fund and that
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
is almost like uh turning that fee into
 
03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
a tax because it could be conceivably
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
used for any purpose at all in the state
 
03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:36.830 align:start position:0%
used for any purpose at all in the state
government

03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.650 --> 03:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
said one one way of thinking about this
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
which I don't entirely agree with is
 
03:07:49.610 --> 03:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
that if the fees in the general fund are
 
03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:50.530 align:start position:0%
that if the fees in the general fund are
then

03:07:50.530 --> 03:07:50.540 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated back to the agency that
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
that charged the fees then it still
 
03:07:58.490 --> 03:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
counts as a fee rather than a tax but
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's really no way to ensure that the
 
03:08:03.530 --> 03:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
department uh will necessarily get those
 
03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
fees back or that when they get it back
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
it will be used for that intended
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
purpose uh the department is
 
03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
so the uh the top
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
so uh the Department of Agriculture is
 
03:08:19.730 --> 03:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
required to analyze a representative
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
sample of fertilizers sold each year to
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that they meet label
 
03:08:23.399 --> 03:08:25.730 align:start position:0%
ensure that they meet label
specifications

03:08:25.730 --> 03:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
however we heard last year in testimony
 
03:08:30.010 --> 03:08:30.020 align:start position:0%
in the soil uh
 
03:08:33.290 --> 03:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
conditioner study that only two batches
 
03:08:36.290 --> 03:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
of fertilizer were tested in the past in
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
that year and that the testing came only
 
03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
in response to complaints that uh it
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
might have been substandard
 
03:08:46.730 --> 03:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
um one reason that less testing was done
 
03:08:49.130 --> 03:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
was probably that the department was
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
using a lot of personnel time to
 
03:08:52.490 --> 03:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
administer a completely different
 
03:08:52.500 --> 03:08:53.530 align:start position:0%
administer a completely different
program

03:08:53.530 --> 03:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
a program that is fortunately actually
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
not being dealt with by the department
 
03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
anymore but
 
03:09:02.570 --> 03:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that program had a free fee structure
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
which didn't come anywhere near meeting
 
03:09:08.450 --> 03:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
the uh funding requirements for it so
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
essentially this the some of the fees
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
from that were going to the general fund
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
and then back into the department
 
03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
um appropriation were not getting used
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
to do the job of the fertilizer fees but
 
03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
to the do the job of the organic program
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh so the sub our study committee felt
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
that redirecting uh the revenue from
 
03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
chapter 431 which is the the fertilizer
 
03:09:38.269 --> 03:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
fund uh it's fertilizer chapter two a
 
03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund uh that will pay for the
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
cost of administering that chapter uh
 
03:09:46.130 --> 03:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
would be more consistent with the ways
 
03:09:48.530 --> 03:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
fees should be handled and would
 
03:09:50.570 --> 03:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
eliminate the possibility that the fees
 
03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
were a disappoint disproportionate tax
 
03:09:56.690 --> 03:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
03:09:58.429 --> 03:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby any
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
03:10:08.450 --> 03:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Bixby can you
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
explain uh for those who might be new to
 
03:10:12.010 --> 03:10:12.020 align:start position:0%
the committee the difference between
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
lapsing and non-lapsing funds
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:10:17.399 --> 03:10:18.469 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
not as well as someone on Ways and Means
 
03:10:23.090 --> 03:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
could but uh basically a non-lap sync
 
03:10:25.070 --> 03:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
fund is a fund that
 
03:10:28.250 --> 03:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh the fund continues to exist uh
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's been more
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to it whereas a lapsing
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
fund basically it
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
it disappears as soon as uh the the the
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
funding for it dries up and it does and
 
03:10:43.969 --> 03:10:43.979 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um it doesn't continue to
 
03:10:43.979 --> 03:10:46.670 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um it doesn't continue to
exist

03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure representative Murray go ahead
 
03:10:51.769 --> 03:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you and then to that end is there
 
03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
a cap on
 
03:10:57.410 --> 03:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
to that uh I did not I did not in this
 
03:11:05.090 --> 03:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
bill put a uh cap on uh how much the
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
fund could uh accrue to I suspect that's
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be an issue given that uh
 
03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:13.490 align:start position:0%
not going to be an issue given that uh
the

03:11:13.490 --> 03:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the the amount of money that is
 
03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
required for uh the Personnel that to uh
 
03:11:24.650 --> 03:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
to administer the in chapter 431
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
03:11:29.570 --> 03:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
um maintenance requirements for with any
 
03:11:31.730 --> 03:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
luck we'll be getting a uh data
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
processing system for uh the department
 
03:11:38.269 --> 03:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
and um so the combination of the costs
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the Personnel their space their
 
03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
materials and uh the data processing is
 
03:11:47.330 --> 03:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
probably enough to at least exhaust the
 
03:11:51.530 --> 03:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.769 --> 03:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh I have one more comment
 
03:12:00.650 --> 03:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
on which is that back when we were doing
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
the study one of the members of the
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
committee suggested that we might need
 
03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
to consider raising the the fee a little
 
03:12:12.889 --> 03:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
bit uh by a nominal amount uh and I did
 
03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
did get give that some consideration and
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
because with the new data processing we
 
03:12:20.690 --> 03:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
don't we won't really know what the
 
03:12:23.809 --> 03:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
needs are for the in that degree of
 
03:12:25.969 --> 03:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
specificity I thought that it would be
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
best to leave the fees as they are
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative knabb
 
03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative is there
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
um would it be beneficial to say that
 
03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
the fee is set by the commissioner as
 
03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
you've done in previous no the fee is
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
actually set in statute and it is uh I
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
believe it's 75 dollars for uh per
 
03:12:50.090 --> 03:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
fertilizer registration which is based
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
on the uh grade of the fertilizer in the
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
brand and it is I think fifty dollars uh
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
for the grade and brand of of lime and
 
03:13:05.090 --> 03:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
then there is a tonnage fee uh which is
 
03:13:08.090 --> 03:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
basically a per ton fee and I don't
 
03:13:10.250 --> 03:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
remember how much that is but it's not
 
03:13:14.330 --> 03:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.130 --> 03:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby any other
 
03:13:16.140 --> 03:13:17.210 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby any other
questions

03:13:17.210 --> 03:13:17.220 align:start position:0%

03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
Department of agricultural markets and
 
03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
food uh appear in support of the bill I
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
think that representative Bixby covered
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
the subject matter very well and I thank
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
him for submitting submitting the bill
 
03:13:56.750 --> 03:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the uh committee that met
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
last year and I will attempt to answer
 
03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.819 --> 03:14:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
so for the funds that have been
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
collected so far for this
 
03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:15.550 align:start position:0%
collected so far for this
um

03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.849 --> 03:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
for registration of fertilizer and so
 
03:14:19.859 --> 03:14:21.170 align:start position:0%
for registration of fertilizer and so
forth

03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
forth
 
03:14:23.929 --> 03:14:23.939 align:start position:0%
that those funds have been put in the
 
03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:14:28.250 --> 03:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
how has Department of Agriculture
 
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
accessed any of that money through the
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
budget process so as I told you I don't
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
know a couple weeks ago now I guess it
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
was that we essentially produce more
 
03:14:43.849 --> 03:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
Revenue than we are required that is
 
03:14:47.330 --> 03:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
required to run the department and that
 
03:14:51.530 --> 03:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
does range from 200 000 to a million in
 
03:14:53.769 --> 03:14:53.779 align:start position:0%
any given fiscal year
 
03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so we do have to put in our budget
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
request this wouldn't change that
 
03:15:03.889 --> 03:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
calculus because a lot of money comes in
 
03:15:03.899 --> 03:15:04.929 align:start position:0%
calculus because a lot of money comes in
from

03:15:04.929 --> 03:15:04.939 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
pesticides as well and so it would not
 
03:15:10.309 --> 03:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
put us into a situation where we were
 
03:15:13.490 --> 03:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
now keeping more money in this fund and
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is correct that it
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
costs more to run the division of
 
03:15:22.190 --> 03:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory Services then this bill would
 
03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:23.210 align:start position:0%
regulatory Services then this bill would
um

03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
bring in but I think it does make it a
 
03:15:31.010 --> 03:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
lot easier for us to to justify the
 
03:15:34.269 --> 03:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
division it'll allow us to really
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
ensure the stability
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know when we went through budget
 
03:15:41.870 --> 03:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
cuts in previous years that's when
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
programs started to be reduced because
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
we did lose Personnel back in
 
03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
2010-11 in that in that era and um
 
03:15:55.150 --> 03:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
having the stability of a dedicated fund
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
prevents that type of thing from
 
03:16:00.290 --> 03:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
happening and when it comes to the
 
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
protection that we provide to Farmers I
 
03:16:05.690 --> 03:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
think it's more important to have that
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
type of stability than it is to say okay
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
well this is where we're going to look
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
to to cut because we are as I've told
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
you largely Consumer Protection Agency
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
so have you had to in the past
 
03:16:22.929 --> 03:16:22.939 align:start position:0%
ask for the money that
 
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
was give was given in these fees did you
 
03:16:29.150 --> 03:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
track how much the fees were coming we
 
03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
always track track the fees I don't have
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
that number with me but we do provide
 
03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:35.690 align:start position:0%
that number with me but we do provide
that

03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
that information in in the budget again
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
showing that depending on the variable
 
03:16:45.650 --> 03:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
um the variance is that we always do
 
03:16:48.170 --> 03:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
turn more money back to the general fund
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
that includes this this would just mean
 
03:16:53.389 --> 03:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
that ultimately we would be requesting
 
03:16:56.030 --> 03:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
less from the general fund moving
 
03:16:56.040 --> 03:16:57.710 align:start position:0%
less from the general fund moving
forward

03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
and one further question from me uh
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm not familiar with that piece
 
03:17:07.490 --> 03:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the budgeting process is
 
03:17:07.500 --> 03:17:08.530 align:start position:0%
of the budgeting process is
um

03:17:08.530 --> 03:17:08.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
so now with this in place
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
you would be able to draw funds directly
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
from this fund to do uh to run the
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
program and we do have fun uh funds
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
primarily it's called the
 
03:17:27.530 --> 03:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
scale testing product and scale testing
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
fund which does give us we still submit
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
the budgetary information but it gives
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
us greater flexibility when there is is
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
a need because in
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:48.050 --> 03:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
a percentage of our the money we bring
 
03:17:50.990 --> 03:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
in goes directly to the general fund and
 
03:17:52.969 --> 03:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
the rest stays in the fee in the funds
 
03:17:56.210 --> 03:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
and the two primarily primary
 
03:17:58.849 --> 03:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
um funds or that product testing which
 
03:18:00.170 --> 03:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
money from
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh from these products currently is is
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
going into a fund and then we have the
 
03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:09.349 align:start position:0%
going into a fund and then we have the
uh

03:18:09.349 --> 03:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:11.570 --> 03:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management fund which
 
03:18:14.269 --> 03:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
was recently changed to allow us to also
 
03:18:18.769 --> 03:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
pay for personnel that that fund was
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
building up a surplus and rather than
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
change that calculus it was better to
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
request less funds from the general fund
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
and take more from where the the
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
revenues were being generated because as
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said there can be a
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
fine line between a tax and a fee
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um fees are not supposed to generate
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
more than 125 percent of the cost of
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
running the program and that calculus is
 
03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit more difficult when monies
 
03:18:55.730 --> 03:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
are going hither and young rather than
 
03:18:58.370 --> 03:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
just coming into the area where they're
 
03:18:59.450 --> 03:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
being spent
 
03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:01.429 align:start position:0%
being spent
um

03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
and one one final question for me about
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
how many other dedicated funds do you
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
have from the Department
 
03:19:12.769 --> 03:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
currently there are a number of very
 
03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
tiny ones I don't know how many there
 
03:19:18.349 --> 03:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
are just two primary funds currently the
 
03:19:21.410 --> 03:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
other ones are related to organic
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
programs and to
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
a few other little things but those are
 
03:19:28.969 --> 03:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
not significant we're talking perhaps
 
03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars we are as
 
03:19:35.929 --> 03:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
of January 1st we have been allowed to
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
take the monies that come in from fines
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
put them into a a fund which is a
 
03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
revolving fund but we can't use more
 
03:19:46.370 --> 03:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
than 75 000 a year to hire someone to
 
03:19:50.450 --> 03:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
actually deal with our
 
03:19:50.460 --> 03:19:51.230 align:start position:0%
actually deal with our
um

03:19:51.230 --> 03:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh hearing cases all of the fines that
 
03:19:56.210 --> 03:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
we issued when we have to have hearings
 
03:19:58.010 --> 03:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
because we have been way behind on that
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
so that is a new new fund but that is
 
03:20:03.290 --> 03:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
just capped at a use of 75 000 per year
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much any questions
 
03:20:07.010 --> 03:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:20:07.020 --> 03:20:08.630 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
Compton

03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
Compton
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
03:20:12.720 --> 03:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
um

03:20:13.610 --> 03:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
in listening to representative bixby's
 
03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:17.510 align:start position:0%
in listening to representative bixby's
testimony

03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and only testing fertilizer twice
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and fertilizer is an important
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
component to agriculture in this state
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
would you say that we are doing the
 
03:20:30.290 --> 03:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
state a disservice by not testing more
 
03:20:30.300 --> 03:20:31.790 align:start position:0%
state a disservice by not testing more
frequently

03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's no question in my mind but that
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
we are doing the the farms and farmers
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
and anyone using commercial
 
03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:41.210 align:start position:0%
and anyone using commercial
um

03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
fertilizer a disservice we should be
 
03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
doing more we want to do more and
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will allow us to do more
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative datsey yes thank you
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you commissioner
 
03:20:56.929 --> 03:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
uh as a little bit of a follow-up to
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that uh in the original bill was is
 
03:21:02.570 --> 03:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
there was there a testing protocol that
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
was outlined in other words I would have
 
03:21:09.230 --> 03:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
assumed that like you know every one ton
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
or something like that what it what is
 
03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:12.590 align:start position:0%
or something like that what it what is
that

03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:15.230 --> 03:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that I'm not totally prepared for
 
03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
sorry that I'm not totally prepared for
that

03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:18.769 align:start position:0%
that
I

03:21:18.769 --> 03:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:21.610 --> 03:21:21.620 align:start position:0%
there is a protocol in place
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
right now the two tests we did last year
 
03:21:27.410 --> 03:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
were at the request and I don't think
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
that is the way it is supposed to work
 
03:21:32.929 --> 03:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
but because we haven't gotten back into
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
that mode that's not something that's uh
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
really in my mind but it is it is
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
totally separate from from this
 
03:21:43.370 --> 03:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you madam chair uh thank
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
you sir I appreciate your testimony in
 
03:21:51.050 --> 03:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
in your grasp of this I
 
03:21:52.610 --> 03:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
didn't let me just
 
03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
say something and tell me how far off I
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
am okay so
 
03:21:59.330 --> 03:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
in essence what this bill says is that
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
the 385
 
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
000 that you've collected
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's gone into the general fund will
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's that is true not quite that that
 
03:22:14.929 --> 03:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
simple because
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
um you know we have been getting the
 
03:22:18.889 --> 03:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
amount we requested from the general
 
03:22:20.570 --> 03:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
fund recently
 
03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
so you know money is going back and
 
03:22:26.510 --> 03:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
forth the problem becomes if somebody
 
03:22:28.370 --> 03:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
decides okay we need a couple hundred
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
thousand here
 
03:22:32.929 --> 03:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
it would be very easy just to
 
03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
not fund our positions which is what has
 
03:22:40.190 --> 03:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
happened in the past and we only you
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
know recently really got well I
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even say we're back to full
 
03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
Staffing I think we are I think in the
 
03:22:50.510 --> 03:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
last budget we actually finally had all
 
03:22:52.730 --> 03:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
of our uh
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
positions that had been cut and
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
the 1011 budget 11 whatever whatever the
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
years were I think we just finally got
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
back to there because that's what
 
03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
back to there because that's what
happened

03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
because they were seen as general fund
 
03:23:07.790 --> 03:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
now the legislature always has the power
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
to come in and sweep our accounts
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.290 --> 03:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
but generally generally when the the
 
03:23:20.690 --> 03:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
people with their eyes on those accounts
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
are looking at them they're looking for
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
funds in the millions not in the
 
03:23:26.929 --> 03:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands so
 
03:23:29.330 --> 03:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
small funds are generally a little
 
03:23:31.010 --> 03:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
better protected unless we really get
 
03:23:31.020 --> 03:23:31.729 align:start position:0%
better protected unless we really get
into

03:23:31.729 --> 03:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:23:33.650 --> 03:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
Dire Straits and then of course I think
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none there are no other pink
 
03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
cards so if anybody else would like to
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
make any comment please let yourself be
 
03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:54.110 align:start position:0%
make any comment please let yourself be
known

03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:00.530 --> 03:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
online we had one
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:14.090 --> 03:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we have one person in support of
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and three people written on
 
03:24:28.090 --> 03:24:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and with that I'm going to
 
03:24:35.929 --> 03:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB 494
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
and we will begin hearing on HB 326
 
03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
um in about seven minutes
 
03:24:46.250 --> 03:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
um at 1 30. so we'll take a little bit
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
do I need to refresh this
 
03:25:03.359 --> 03:25:09.769 align:start position:0%
do I need to refresh this
no

03:25:09.769 --> 03:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.779 --> 03:32:44.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:32:44.570 --> 03:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.450 --> 03:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.650 --> 03:33:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.929 --> 03:33:04.939 align:start position:0%
okay it is
 
03:33:08.330 --> 03:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
131 in the afternoon I am
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to open up the hearing that we
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
have for HB 326 prohibiting the use of
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagulant
 
03:33:17.220 --> 03:33:19.010 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagulant
rodenticides

03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
rodenticides
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
and here with us today
 
03:33:23.929 --> 03:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill is representative
 
03:33:26.330 --> 03:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
Jerry Cannon
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
and welcome to environment and
 
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you for the invitation
 
03:33:32.040 --> 03:33:32.630 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you for the invitation
um

03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair fellow members of the of the
 
03:33:39.290 --> 03:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee and in the State House
 
03:33:41.690 --> 03:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm here before you to talk about
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
something that I didn't know anything
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
about until this past
 
03:33:48.530 --> 03:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
six months
 
03:33:53.769 --> 03:33:53.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:57.290 --> 03:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
we all know that New Hampshire is is
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
tourists playground
 
03:34:02.690 --> 03:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of things to do
 
03:34:02.700 --> 03:34:04.550 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of things to do
and

03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
when we think about it people come here
 
03:34:11.210 --> 03:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
to ski to swim to hike
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people come to take
 
03:34:12.720 --> 03:34:14.090 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people come to take
photographs

03:34:14.090 --> 03:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
photographs
 
03:34:16.490 --> 03:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
of our wildlife
 
03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:17.809 align:start position:0%
of our wildlife
um

03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
the birds
 
03:34:24.410 --> 03:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
the the Bears the
 
03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh the many forms that we have
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
um in in our mountains and in our
 
03:34:32.819 --> 03:34:34.790 align:start position:0%
um in in our mountains and in our
communities

03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
um even just down the
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
the street for me along the river
 
03:34:42.050 --> 03:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
between us and Maine we have some bald
 
03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
eagles and they're really impressive to
 
03:34:48.490 --> 03:34:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
this is what people come to New
 
03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
especially in the fall let's see the
 
03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:57.530 align:start position:0%
especially in the fall let's see the
foliage

03:34:57.530 --> 03:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
foliage
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
if we lost
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
and I say that because this bill isn't
 
03:35:10.370 --> 03:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
just about rodents
 
03:35:13.130 --> 03:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's about all of our wildlife and
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
especially that our carnivores or the
 
03:35:22.190 --> 03:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from a number of
 
03:35:25.309 --> 03:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
folks today that have more knowledge
 
03:35:27.769 --> 03:35:27.779 align:start position:0%
than I on on the topic as well as
 
03:35:30.650 --> 03:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
experience of working with our Wildlife
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
especially our Raptors
 
03:35:36.170 --> 03:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
um and the horrifying things that I've
 
03:35:40.849 --> 03:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
are raptors and many of the animals that
 
03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
prey on rodents
 
03:35:51.889 --> 03:35:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.769 --> 03:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
they take care of the rodents
 
03:35:58.969 --> 03:35:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.969 --> 03:36:01.979 align:start position:0%
the challenge is is that we're poisoning
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
their diet
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
and that one of the primary culprits are
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
the second generation anticoagulant
 
03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:12.710 align:start position:0%
the second generation anticoagulant
rodentsides

03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
rodentsides
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.889 --> 03:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
our native Wildlife predators are really
 
03:36:23.630 --> 03:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
a public Trust
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
their nature they do this they maintain
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
well the rodents that we have are food
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
for our wildlife
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
especially our Birds prey
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
we know that they damage our property
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
and Food Supplies
 
03:36:48.349 --> 03:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
to combat these
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.969 --> 03:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
even I needed toxins this past this past
 
03:37:01.010 --> 03:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
few months I had a couple of rats in my
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
own home and had to go down to Home
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
Depot and see what they had
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
I couldn't catch them in my have a heart
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
trap so I needed something else
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
there were plenty erotic sites on the
 
03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
there were plenty erotic sites on the
Shelf

03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
Shelf
 
03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:17.300 align:start position:0%
as I checked them there there were no
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
escars as we referred to them
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
on any of those products but there were
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
some anticoagulant drugs that are in the
 
03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the products that consumers can use
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
it only took two to three days before I
 
03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:33.469 align:start position:0%
it only took two to three days before I
caught

03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
caught
 
03:37:36.370 --> 03:37:36.380 align:start position:0%
and killed all the rats in my home
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
thankfully my dogs cornered one of them
 
03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
so it was a natural progression they
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
were able to have them hunt them down I
 
03:37:48.769 --> 03:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
was glad they didn't have to take a bite
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:51.469 align:start position:0%
of them
and

03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
catch any poisons that might have been
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
ingested by the rat before they caught
 
03:37:55.680 --> 03:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
ingested by the rat before they caught
them

03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.690 --> 03:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
the most recent varieties of these these
 
03:38:02.700 --> 03:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
the most recent varieties of these these
toxins

03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
toxins
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
are these
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagulant rodent
 
03:38:09.540 --> 03:38:11.150 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagulant rodent
sites

03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
sites
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
and I say this because
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
typically when we poison a rat or a
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
mouse or anything is that the shelf life
 
03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:23.690 align:start position:0%
mouse or anything is that the shelf life
the

03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
of that poison is typically just in the
 
03:38:31.250 --> 03:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
rat and by the time they die it's not
 
03:38:32.809 --> 03:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
um critical for any animal that that
 
03:38:37.969 --> 03:38:37.979 align:start position:0%
eats it
 
03:38:40.450 --> 03:38:40.460 align:start position:0%
but the second generation
 
03:38:42.410 --> 03:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
rodentsides are
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
have a have a uh a life of about 100
 
03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
days or more
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
in that creature that has died and now
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
is available for any any creature that
 
03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
comes across a dead rat and says and you
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
know it's it's just a natural thing to
 
03:39:02.450 --> 03:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
eat eat that right rat and it's actually
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
very easy prey
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
for our Raptors because they're they're
 
03:39:10.490 --> 03:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
not moving
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the problems we have
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
is that a road that a Raptor
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
um whose primary diet has these rodents
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
is going to pick up these these rodents
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
and take it back to their nest and
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to eat it and possibly
 
03:39:27.410 --> 03:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
feed it to their young
 
03:39:31.070 --> 03:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
or an ingesting this this poison they
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
would be poisoning the eggs that they
 
03:39:40.969 --> 03:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.229 --> 03:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
I have to cons have to consider the rat
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is a terrible way for these
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
creatures to die
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
um because the anticoagulant
 
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
wrote inside
 
03:39:59.690 --> 03:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
essentially it if they if they start to
 
03:40:02.809 --> 03:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
bleed this they just bleed out
 
03:40:02.819 --> 03:40:04.309 align:start position:0%
bleed this they just bleed out
or

03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's going they're going to bleed inside
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
causing them great pain and they will
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
die that way
 
03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
there are other methods
 
03:40:16.250 --> 03:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we can use
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
to kill the rats
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
capture the rats there are traps there
 
03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
are other there the med the thing I
 
03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
bought from uh Home Depot
 
03:40:30.769 --> 03:40:30.779 align:start position:0%
it is a good product and it does kill a
 
03:40:36.050 --> 03:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:38.330 --> 03:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
you find that there have been studies
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
from unh
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
and they found rodentsides in in a very
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
high percentage of the animals tested
 
03:40:48.050 --> 03:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
not just
 
03:40:52.690 --> 03:40:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
the rodent sides
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
that have been used they lead to direct
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
mortality and chronic long-term Health
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
impacts for natural predators
 
03:41:08.330 --> 03:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
and non-target organisms and even our
 
03:41:14.330 --> 03:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I saw on the
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
label of the product was to flag that
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
there was a problem for
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
non-target species
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I was trying to figure out from a
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
conservative standpoint
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's what it stated there but does a
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
in these asgards although they're not
 
03:41:39.229 --> 03:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
available currently in the in the FDA
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
has has flagged them is not acceptable
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
for Consumer use
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
are still being used by by many licensed
 
03:41:46.380 --> 03:41:50.030 align:start position:0%
are still being used by by many licensed
professionals

03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't completely eliminate escars
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
it does reduce the amount of places
 
03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
that they can be used
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
and including areas where there is an
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
infestation of rats but hasn't been able
 
03:42:12.410 --> 03:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
to control with conventional products
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
these are dangerous products
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like
 
03:42:29.450 --> 03:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
throwing a defoliant on your on your
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
lawn to kill
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
crabgrass but instead you're killing the
 
03:42:34.979 --> 03:42:36.710 align:start position:0%
crabgrass but instead you're killing the
entire

03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
entire
 
03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
grasp and have to deal with replanting
 
03:42:43.370 --> 03:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
the whole thing the problem is is that
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're killing off our wildlife
 
03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:48.779 align:start position:0%
it's not just the rats it's anything
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
that eats them
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
and sadly we have to think about the
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
future for our our wildlife
 
03:43:02.290 --> 03:43:02.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
I plead with you
 
03:43:09.290 --> 03:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on this this bill
 
03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
so we can save our state wildlife
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cannon any
 
03:43:18.650 --> 03:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative knabb
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you said you just started researching
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
this about six months ago what triggered
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
you working on this legislation
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
I went to on the wing in Epping which
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
many of you may have seen
 
03:43:37.250 --> 03:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
um from the New Hampshire uh
 
03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
just throw a blank
 
03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:41.939 align:start position:0%
but you'll hear some folks that have
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
have been uh uh have been in
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
organizations that are essentially
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
caring for these Raptors I saw a number
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
of rap beautiful birds snowy white owl
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
actually the one that I saw I learned it
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
had been poisoned they had it recovered
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
and was back for a second time and as it
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
was flagged to me is that he said that
 
03:44:12.650 --> 03:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
owl just is not right anymore
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
um it's affected their brain
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
they were Hawks
 
03:44:19.370 --> 03:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
they were Eagles
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
they were quite a number of animals
 
03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
they were quite a number of animals
there

03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
and one of the statistics that they
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
shared was
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the birds that come to this
 
03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
to their Clinic
 
03:44:33.650 --> 03:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
only about 30 percent of the birds that
 
03:44:35.690 --> 03:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
were able to save
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:39.359 --> 03:44:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
to see these beautiful creatures
 
03:44:45.889 --> 03:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
and then to learn about
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
why they were there
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
it really it hurt
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
I said because this is a man-made
 
03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
I said because this is a man-made
problem

03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:44:57.010 --> 03:44:57.020 align:start position:0%
that we have done this
 
03:44:59.690 --> 03:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for us to kill something
 
03:45:00.889 --> 03:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
in our homes
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
or in the community we have created this
 
03:45:04.439 --> 03:45:06.110 align:start position:0%
or in the community we have created this
problem

03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the light dawned I I got
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
to speak up on this because that's
 
03:45:11.939 --> 03:45:16.550 align:start position:0%
to speak up on this because that's
painful

03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cannon
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate your testimony this
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you now I'd like to call
 
03:45:29.330 --> 03:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner Sean Jasper from the
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to come and
 
03:45:31.020 --> 03:45:31.729 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to come and
speak

03:45:31.729 --> 03:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:45:40.490 --> 03:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.170 --> 03:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee I am Sean Jasper commissioner
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Agriculture markets
 
03:45:47.150 --> 03:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
and food
 
03:45:50.450 --> 03:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in opposition to the
 
03:45:50.460 --> 03:45:51.769 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in opposition to the
bill

03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
and not because I'm not
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:46:00.290 --> 03:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
wildlife and what may be happening
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
but because we have a process
 
03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
in-state statute
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
that allows us to look at this without
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
tugging at the emotions and using actual
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
research not just
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
that points to a a problem but without
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
the scientific information behind it we
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
have been looking at this issue I chair
 
03:46:31.610 --> 03:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
the pesticide control board which is
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
charged by Statute with looking at the
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
uses of of pesticides and what the
 
03:46:40.370 --> 03:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
effects are and the proper way to deal
 
03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
with this is to let us scientifically
 
03:46:45.170 --> 03:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
look at the problem as a matter of fact
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
the governor has brought this to our
 
03:46:50.809 --> 03:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
attention because he was believing that
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
this was an immediate problem that we
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
needed to do something we've been able
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
to show him the evidence that
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
leads us to believe at this at this
 
03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
point there may be other issues
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
some of you will remember a few years
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
ago we had a bill about pesticides being
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
the problem for
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
be die off
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
and in in fact what the evidence is is
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
showing is that it's mites some of it is
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
related to the global warming where on
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
warm days like we had a couple of weeks
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
ago the bees wake up they go out looking
 
03:47:29.450 --> 03:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
for food they don't find any they go
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
into other hives that may be infected
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
have not been treated they bring it back
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and the hives die
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are testing birds that that have died
 
03:47:42.769 --> 03:47:42.779 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire there has been have
 
03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:46.090 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire there has been have
been

03:47:46.090 --> 03:47:46.100 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
none that have been shown to have died
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
by ingesting
 
03:47:53.450 --> 03:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
um this material in Massachusetts there
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
has been one
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
but that in fact was a case where the
 
03:48:03.410 --> 03:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
um rodenticide was not properly put out
 
03:48:05.809 --> 03:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
in the bird ingested that directly that
 
03:48:08.090 --> 03:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
obviously should not happen
 
03:48:11.690 --> 03:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
and that's a a problem potentially we
 
03:48:11.700 --> 03:48:13.250 align:start position:0%
and that's a a problem potentially we
received

03:48:13.250 --> 03:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
received
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
um a report this past
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
summer fall that led to some of this
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
where there was this belief that there
 
03:48:22.969 --> 03:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
was a huge problem I believe it was in
 
03:48:24.650 --> 03:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
the Hampton area
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
we immediately sent inspectors over to
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
investigate to try to collect
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
um the dead birds
 
03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:34.370 align:start position:0%
um the dead birds
nothing

03:48:34.370 --> 03:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
came of it it was an exaggeration
 
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm not here to tell you that there
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
isn't a problem
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to tell you that there is a
 
03:48:43.319 --> 03:48:44.690 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to tell you that there is a
problem

03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you that we are looking at
 
03:48:49.190 --> 03:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
it and that the evidence should be
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
brought to the pesticide control board
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
for us to look at it to follow that that
 
03:48:56.690 --> 03:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
process because we are all concerned
 
03:49:00.349 --> 03:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
about that but please don't override the
 
03:49:03.170 --> 03:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
process that the legislature has has put
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
in place director Russo is here to uh to
 
03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
speak to this he has a lot more
 
03:49:11.330 --> 03:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
knowledge on the details than I do so
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you not to ask me questions
 
03:49:16.010 --> 03:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
about the science behind it I am not a
 
03:49:16.020 --> 03:49:17.570 align:start position:0%
about the science behind it I am not a
scientist

03:49:17.570 --> 03:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
scientist
 
03:49:17.580 --> 03:49:18.290 align:start position:0%
scientist
um

03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:20.990 --> 03:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
but we have concerns we are working with
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
fish and game as a under the directive
 
03:49:25.010 --> 03:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
of the governor to look at this Pro
 
03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
problem and to come back to him with a
 
03:49:30.410 --> 03:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
report on what our findings are I think
 
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's very important not to overreact not
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
to just assume we need to see the the
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
pathology behind this we need to have
 
03:49:41.290 --> 03:49:41.300 align:start position:0%
the necropsies of these birds to show
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
what in fact has has killed them before
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
we go to this step because let's not
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
pretend that rats are nice little
 
03:49:48.660 --> 03:49:49.790 align:start position:0%
pretend that rats are nice little
creatures

03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
creatures
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
they're not you know and they're one
 
03:49:54.290 --> 03:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
thing if they're out
 
03:49:54.300 --> 03:49:55.729 align:start position:0%
thing if they're out
perhaps

03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:49:58.250 --> 03:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you know in the wild they're another
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
thing if we find them in the cities
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
where rat populations can grow you know
 
03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
very very rapidly and I think we've all
 
03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
seen you know thankfully not in New
 
03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I think we've seen stories
 
03:50:13.570 --> 03:50:13.580 align:start position:0%
over the years about you know children
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
babies in in some of our more congested
 
03:50:19.729 --> 03:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
cities being you know bitten
 
03:50:22.729 --> 03:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
by rats they are not our friends they're
 
03:50:24.769 --> 03:50:24.779 align:start position:0%
never going to be our friends and we
 
03:50:28.670 --> 03:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we protect people
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
from what rats can do to them and to
 
03:50:32.279 --> 03:50:32.990 align:start position:0%
from what rats can do to them and to
um

03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:35.210 --> 03:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
to our environment in general
 
03:50:38.809 --> 03:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
um they're not a clean nice animal so
 
03:50:38.819 --> 03:50:39.650 align:start position:0%
um they're not a clean nice animal so
um

03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
listen to the care to the testimony
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
carefully but know we are working at it
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
know that we want to uh we we have the
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
authority to ban this
 
03:50:52.190 --> 03:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
um if in fact it is found to be the
 
03:50:55.250 --> 03:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
problem legislation is not needed we
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
already have that Authority Under the
 
03:50:58.610 --> 03:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
pesticide control board
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
oh thank you any questions from the
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
03:51:08.040 --> 03:51:08.990 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
um

03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
so my question is just to um is I guess
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
just a further clarification and what
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
you said that at this point
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
um there is no problem that you've found
 
03:51:22.490 --> 03:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
correct so how many am like if you just
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
just a basic how many how many birds or
 
03:51:29.929 --> 03:51:29.939 align:start position:0%
um you know Foxes or anything else or
 
03:51:33.410 --> 03:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
that have you tested I think there are
 
03:51:35.330 --> 03:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
those behind me who will be testifying
 
03:51:36.650 --> 03:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
that can answer your question better
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.410 --> 03:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the makeup of the pesticide control
 
03:51:45.420 --> 03:51:48.650 align:start position:0%
to the makeup of the pesticide control
board

03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
we have I think
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps director Russo can speak to that
 
03:51:56.090 --> 03:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
we do have citizen members we have
 
03:51:58.210 --> 03:51:58.220 align:start position:0%
members from
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
many different
 
03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:01.610 align:start position:0%
many different
um

03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise but David Russo can
 
03:52:06.410 --> 03:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
speak to that more directly I don't have
 
03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
that off the top of my head but I he
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
works with it all the time so I think
 
03:52:12.010 --> 03:52:12.020 align:start position:0%
you can answer that very completely
 
03:52:14.210 --> 03:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:52:15.660 --> 03:52:16.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
commissioner

03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:52:18.650 --> 03:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this is a science
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
question but if it crosses that line
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
then you know I can ask it if someone
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
else but uh first of all I want to say I
 
03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate and very sensitive to when we
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
make changes we have to make changes
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
based on evidence so I appreciate you
 
03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
know your comments about that uh this
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon my question is is this
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can make it clear uh given
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
all of the other methods that we have of
 
03:52:42.540 --> 03:52:44.030 align:start position:0%
all of the other methods that we have of
of

03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:52:45.889 --> 03:52:45.899 align:start position:0%
um dealing with with the rat population
 
03:52:45.899 --> 03:52:48.050 align:start position:0%
um dealing with with the rat population
right

03:52:48.050 --> 03:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
um how what would be the the larger
 
03:52:53.330 --> 03:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
impact If This Were to pass for example
 
03:52:56.690 --> 03:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
right so given other methods are we
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
talking about this does something that
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
is so important that it fills a niche
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
which is so important in our strategy
 
03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
and dealing with the rat population that
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we only relied upon other methods of
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
of control that we would be leaving
 
03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a precarious situation
 
03:53:19.849 --> 03:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
don't want to try to pass it off but I
 
03:53:22.210 --> 03:53:22.220 align:start position:0%
will to a larger degree because
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are certainly evidence relative to
 
03:53:27.769 --> 03:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
the knee I mean once once you find
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
something that is very effective
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
nobody really puts more research into
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
how do we kill something better
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
so just intuitively I'm going to tell
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
you that what's been out there has not
 
03:53:42.530 --> 03:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
been as effective as we would like it to
 
03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
be or would not have been Advanced but
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
again I think that there will be those
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
who can answer that more more
 
03:53:52.010 --> 03:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
scientifically but as far as I know
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a negative impact where
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
we to to ban this
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:03.410 --> 03:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question in
 
03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
the agricultural industry
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there has been an uptick in rodents
 
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
um especially large rats uh infiltrating
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
Farms if we were to ban anything that
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
could help with that what would happen
 
03:54:22.849 --> 03:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
to the agricultural industry if we had
 
03:54:25.729 --> 03:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
an overrun of the rodent population
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid it would be negative
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
um you know rats are carriers of disease
 
03:54:33.769 --> 03:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
and um you know they can carry some
 
03:54:36.110 --> 03:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
pretty serious diseases and when they
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
bite which if they are hungry they will
 
03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:41.330 align:start position:0%
bite which if they are hungry they will
um

03:54:41.330 --> 03:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
you know I can't really tell you what
 
03:54:44.689 --> 03:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
those results would be but it would be
 
03:54:44.699 --> 03:54:45.710 align:start position:0%
those results would be but it would be
negative

03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
negative
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
so I that's why we need to look at this
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
very carefully because there are always
 
03:54:50.399 --> 03:54:51.769 align:start position:0%
very carefully because there are always
trade-offs

03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
trade-offs
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
and we have to weigh the the negatives
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the positives of doing something
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
like this but the pesticide control
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
board is not afraid of of banning things
 
03:55:06.050 --> 03:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
which have negative consequences to our
 
03:55:08.750 --> 03:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
environment and potentially this does
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you commissioner for
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question I am curious I think
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
it was testified too that uh it I
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe unh
 
03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:28.130 align:start position:0%
believe unh
um

03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
had found rodenticides have they brought
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
that before the uh with you as the chair
 
03:55:37.130 --> 03:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
of this have they they have they have
 
03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
not and
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.279 --> 03:55:48.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:55:48.650 --> 03:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.929 --> 03:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
but but we didn't get anything
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay just sorry about that just wanna so
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
there has been some information that
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
that has come through fish and game on
 
03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
that I don't know where it came from but
 
03:56:09.769 --> 03:56:09.779 align:start position:0%
I you know we work with uh Cooperative
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
Extension and
 
03:56:15.530 --> 03:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
um in UNH quite closely but it if it
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't Cooperative Extension it was
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
somebody else they may not have brought
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
it to us but certainly I have seen no
 
03:56:21.420 --> 03:56:22.450 align:start position:0%
it to us but certainly I have seen no
research

03:56:22.450 --> 03:56:22.460 align:start position:0%
research
 
03:56:26.929 --> 03:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
that has UNH attached to it
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
no thank you commissioner Jasper and now
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Carol Foss from New
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
you've asked for three minutes to speak
 
03:56:49.490 --> 03:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
and you are suggesting an amendment
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm hoping I can do
 
03:57:07.610 --> 03:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
this in three minutes so I I might have
 
03:57:09.950 --> 03:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
been a little conservative there
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
um there's no question that rodents are
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
or infestations of rodents can be a
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
major inexpensive problem
 
03:57:22.969 --> 03:57:22.979 align:start position:0%
um there's also no question that some of
 
03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that are used to
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
address rodent
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
infestations cause major problems for
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
some New Hampshire wildlife
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
Andy coagulant rodenticide's work by
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
interfering with the
 
03:57:46.969 --> 03:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
blood clotting process in the body
 
03:57:52.090 --> 03:57:52.100 align:start position:0%
um first generation rodenticides include
 
03:57:57.769 --> 03:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
the Coumadin that many of us may be
 
03:57:57.779 --> 03:57:59.269 align:start position:0%
the Coumadin that many of us may be
taking

03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:57:59.279 --> 03:57:59.929 align:start position:0%
taking
um

03:57:59.929 --> 03:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:03.229 --> 03:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
second generation rodenticides are much
 
03:58:06.130 --> 03:58:06.140 align:start position:0%
more potent and whereas the first
 
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
generation chemicals may it may take
 
03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
several meals of The Poisoned bait in
 
03:58:17.809 --> 03:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
order for an animal to succumb with the
 
03:58:19.969 --> 03:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
second generation rodenticides
 
03:58:23.469 --> 03:58:23.479 align:start position:0%
animals typically die after a single
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
meal from the bait
 
03:58:26.399 --> 03:58:28.969 align:start position:0%
meal from the bait
um

03:58:28.969 --> 03:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.010 --> 03:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
in either case mice and rats that have
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
eaten these poisons can live for several
 
03:58:37.130 --> 03:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
days and during that time they're kind
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
of running around in the environment
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
where they can be easy prey for Hawks
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
owls fissures foxes and other predators
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
of small mammals
 
03:58:48.840 --> 03:58:49.790 align:start position:0%
of small mammals
um

03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:52.250 --> 03:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
there was some reference to tests at UNH
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
and the veterinary Diagnostic lab at UNH
 
03:58:59.330 --> 03:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
um tested 35 fur-bearing animals
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
including I believe foxes Fishers well
 
03:59:06.889 --> 03:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
both red and gray foxes and Fishers from
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
24 New Hampshire towns in 2019 to 2020
 
03:59:14.929 --> 03:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
and found the second generation a
 
03:59:16.570 --> 03:59:16.580 align:start position:0%
residues of the second generation
 
03:59:19.450 --> 03:59:19.460 align:start position:0%
rodenticides in all but one individual
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
so it's out there in our in our
 
03:59:26.090 --> 03:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
environment it's getting into
 
03:59:29.150 --> 03:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
um Wildlife predators
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
um necropsies of birds of prey in New
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
England have found high concentrations
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals
 
03:59:36.660 --> 03:59:37.729 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals
um

03:59:37.729 --> 03:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:40.729 --> 03:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
so there are some concerns about how
 
03:59:40.739 --> 03:59:42.170 align:start position:0%
so there are some concerns about how
effective

03:59:42.170 --> 03:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
the proposed ban would be in addressing
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
the wildlife problems
 
03:59:47.279 --> 03:59:48.650 align:start position:0%
the wildlife problems
um

03:59:48.650 --> 03:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:52.010 --> 03:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
the exceptions to the proposed ban
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
certainly provide ample opportunity for
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
poisoned mice and rats to get out there
 
04:00:03.769 --> 04:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.779 --> 04:00:05.450 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:00:05.450 --> 04:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
United States Environmental Protection
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
Agency has recognized the risks
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
associated with these chemicals and is
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
currently in the process of developing
 
04:00:19.729 --> 04:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures specifically to
 
04:00:22.010 --> 04:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
address concerns with federally listed
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
threatened and endangered species
 
04:00:24.899 --> 04:00:25.670 align:start position:0%
threatened and endangered species
um

04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
and what we would like to suggest is
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
that this will be amended to authorize a
 
04:00:35.210 --> 04:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
working group that would convene the
 
04:00:38.170 --> 04:00:38.180 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders in this issue
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
including representatives of New
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed pesticide applicators
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
division of Public Public Health
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
Services the division of pesticide
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
control division of AG markets and Foods
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
04:00:57.370 --> 04:00:57.380 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic Veterinary Lab at UNH
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
licensed New Hampshire rehabilitators
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Audubon and this group
 
04:01:07.150 --> 04:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
could really address the science
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
investigate the seasonal and geographic
 
04:01:12.250 --> 04:01:12.260 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
significant rodent infestations in New
 
04:01:15.600 --> 04:01:16.610 align:start position:0%
significant rodent infestations in New
Hampshire

04:01:16.610 --> 04:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:01:19.490 --> 04:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody really has a
 
04:01:22.010 --> 04:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
handle on that from a Statewide
 
04:01:22.020 --> 04:01:23.870 align:start position:0%
handle on that from a Statewide
perspective

04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:01:23.880 --> 04:01:24.469 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
look at the current frequency duration
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
type and geographic distribution of
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
rodenticide applications in New
 
04:01:34.610 --> 04:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because most of these
 
04:01:37.370 --> 04:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
applications one would hope all are
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
being made by licensed professionals
 
04:01:40.920 --> 04:01:42.110 align:start position:0%
being made by licensed professionals
um

04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:45.050 --> 04:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
and assess the likelihood that the EPA
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures will be sufficient
 
04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
to address New Hampshire's speech
 
04:01:55.809 --> 04:01:55.819 align:start position:0%
Wildlife species of conservation concern
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and identify any additional mitigation
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
measures that might be appropriate in
 
04:02:05.210 --> 04:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
so with that I will thank you for your
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
attention and close my testimony
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes uh just for uh to clarify
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
is your Amendment on for the for a work
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh our working group would that replace
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
the ban or would that be in addition to
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
the ban
 
04:02:31.490 --> 04:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
that would be up to you folks I I I'm as
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
the person requesting it I'm I'm my
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
question to you is if in your ideal
 
04:02:40.510 --> 04:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
world would that working group uh be
 
04:02:42.769 --> 04:02:42.779 align:start position:0%
would there be a ban as well as the
 
04:02:44.929 --> 04:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
working group or would would the working
 
04:02:47.330 --> 04:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
group basically help figure out if we
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're not against the ban but we
 
04:02:57.050 --> 04:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are that there
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of sides to this issue
 
04:02:59.100 --> 04:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of sides to this issue
and

04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:00.720 --> 04:03:03.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
we would like to see a scientific
 
04:03:08.809 --> 04:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
approach taken to really understand the
 
04:03:10.729 --> 04:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
big picture
 
04:03:10.739 --> 04:03:12.050 align:start position:0%
big picture
um

04:03:12.050 --> 04:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:14.929 --> 04:03:14.939 align:start position:0%
and where where are the major rat issues
 
04:03:16.969 --> 04:03:16.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
um how are they being addressed but just
 
04:03:22.130 --> 04:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
get everyone get all the stakeholders
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
around the table and try and come up
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
with with an approach that is acceptable
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
to everybody okay thank you thank you
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:03:33.720 --> 04:03:35.570 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Creighton

04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Matt thank you madam chair and
 
04:03:40.610 --> 04:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
ma'am great great testimony I'm just I
 
04:03:42.170 --> 04:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
want to clarify
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
what what do you see the difference
 
04:03:45.889 --> 04:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
between the department of agriculture's
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
poison commission and your proposed
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
group that would also look at the same
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing it seems like it's to my knowledge
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
the pesticides board does not have a
 
04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
representation from the veterinary
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics Lab at UNH for example from
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabilitators
 
04:04:09.660 --> 04:04:10.790 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabilitators
um

04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
from our organization
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
I guess there is someone on there from
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
04:04:21.010 --> 04:04:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow up so the mission would be the
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
same but the makeup will be different
 
04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
well I think the mission would be
 
04:04:34.610 --> 04:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
a little broader to do more
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
Research into
 
04:04:38.040 --> 04:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
Research into
where

04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
how often at what time of year what are
 
04:04:46.370 --> 04:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
the patterns of rodent infestations in
 
04:04:47.410 --> 04:04:47.420 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think that goes a little beyond the
 
04:04:52.620 --> 04:04:54.590 align:start position:0%
I think that goes a little beyond the
um

04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:57.530 --> 04:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
the the usual business of the pesticides
 
04:04:57.540 --> 04:04:59.150 align:start position:0%
the the usual business of the pesticides
board

04:04:59.150 --> 04:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it would be it would be kind of a
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
study group to really look into
 
04:05:08.290 --> 04:05:08.300 align:start position:0%
all aspects of the problem
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
and also to evaluate how the EPA
 
04:05:15.170 --> 04:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures that are supposed to
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
be coming out later this year
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
how effective would those be in
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire species of
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
conservation concern okay thank you
 
04:05:26.460 --> 04:05:28.250 align:start position:0%
conservation concern okay thank you
ma'am

04:05:28.250 --> 04:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
 
04:05:33.290 --> 04:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes so would you see the working
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
group as essentially
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
something that would be working in in
 
04:05:40.010 --> 04:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the pesticide control
 
04:05:42.769 --> 04:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
board in order to provide them with the
 
04:05:44.570 --> 04:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
broader range of evidence they need in
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
order to make an appropriate judgment as
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
opposed to something that would be
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
working either in parallel or even like
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
in contradiction to them
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess my vision would be that
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
this working group would would prepare a
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
report and I think that the pesticides
 
04:06:04.729 --> 04:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
control board would be an excellent
 
04:06:07.250 --> 04:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
recipient of that report
 
04:06:10.010 --> 04:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
because they would be they would be in
 
04:06:12.530 --> 04:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
the position to act on it if
 
04:06:12.540 --> 04:06:14.210 align:start position:0%
the position to act on it if
recommendations

04:06:14.210 --> 04:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:06:16.809 --> 04:06:16.819 align:start position:0%
were put forth
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so essentially
 
04:06:21.650 --> 04:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
you'd see the working group as as a way
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
of supporting the work of the control
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
board in in order to find a the most
 
04:06:25.920 --> 04:06:27.170 align:start position:0%
board in in order to find a the most
accurate

04:06:27.170 --> 04:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:06:27.180 --> 04:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
accurate
um

04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh approach to this problem
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable way of putting it yes
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much for your
 
04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:42.349 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much for your
testimony

04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call David Rousseau from New
 
04:06:47.530 --> 04:06:47.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you I'm David
 
04:06:50.809 --> 04:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
Rousseau with New Hampshire Department
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture markets and food I'm the
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
director of the division of pesticide
 
04:06:56.210 --> 04:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
control and with me is Robert bruly
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
Robert is a an environmentalist with
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
division of pesticide control and he
 
04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
also has an advanced degree in uh in
 
04:07:03.530 --> 04:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
wildlife biology I think one of the
 
04:07:05.330 --> 04:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
things that will help to this discussion
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
on the last page of the the letter that
 
04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
the department had provided it
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
identifies the chemical types of
 
04:07:15.650 --> 04:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
rodenticides there are and I think it
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
will help in this discussion to sort of
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at that there's um really
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
two groups
 
04:07:24.050 --> 04:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
of rodenticides in regard to chemistry
 
04:07:26.090 --> 04:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
there's a first generation anticoagulant
 
04:07:27.849 --> 04:07:27.859 align:start position:0%
and those were pretty much
 
04:07:30.170 --> 04:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
pre-1970s we have War firing on that
 
04:07:30.180 --> 04:07:30.910 align:start position:0%
pre-1970s we have War firing on that
list

04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
chlorophysinone and diphosinone again
 
04:07:36.769 --> 04:07:36.779 align:start position:0%
pre-70s they weren't called first
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
generation when they when they came out
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
what pushed them into that designation
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
was the second generation anticoagulants
 
04:07:45.650 --> 04:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
but it needs a rodenticide is a
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
pesticide and it's used to control
 
04:07:49.729 --> 04:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
rodents a coagulant refers to normal
 
04:07:52.130 --> 04:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
blood clotting an anticoagulant refers
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
to in this conversation is it controls
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
Road rodents by disrupting blood
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
clotting okay so that's what we're
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
talking about in regard to coagulant
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
anticoagulant so these first generation
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants that became a resistance
 
04:08:06.410 --> 04:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
the animals were resistant to those
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
materials and that's why we have the
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
second generation come about and that
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
includes the Roto vacuum the broader
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
dialogue the diphythylon and the
 
04:08:17.650 --> 04:08:17.660 align:start position:0%
diphunaculum so those second generation
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants was 1970s
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and we should we've been using them
 
04:08:24.969 --> 04:08:24.979 align:start position:0%
since um and then we have the
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
non-anticoagulants and that includes
 
04:08:26.520 --> 04:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
non-anticoagulants and that includes
bromophilin

04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
bromophilin
 
04:08:30.650 --> 04:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
Cola calciferol and the zinc phosphide
 
04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
now all these three groups currently are
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
being reviewed by the United States
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency the
 
04:08:38.330 --> 04:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
United States Environmental Protection
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency requires manufactures
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
of pesticides to satisfy certain
 
04:08:46.250 --> 04:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
standards how that chemical will react
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
in the environment what its impact might
 
04:08:50.170 --> 04:08:50.180 align:start position:0%
be to the human health
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
there's a number of standards that come
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
into play and if that company the
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer identifies or satisfies
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
those standards then those products
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
become available so these products that
 
04:09:01.969 --> 04:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today the the ones
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
on the list that I just identified are
 
04:09:06.050 --> 04:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
all identified by the the federal
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
government as being appropriate for use
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
when using accordance with their label
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
now EPA as mentioned in this discussion
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
there is some preliminary
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
intermediate preliminary decisions on
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
how to further restrict all three groups
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
so that we we don't have this this
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
concern this this this this challenge
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
with the residue and animals the
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
department is no shape in form saying
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
that we don't recognize that there is
 
04:09:33.370 --> 04:09:33.380 align:start position:0%
residue of these materials in animals
 
04:09:36.110 --> 04:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
birds and mammals there's no there's no
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
doubt that that exists and I appreciate
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the the bill from representative
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
canon in identifying that that that's a
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
concern it's a concern that we have
 
04:09:46.370 --> 04:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and the federal government right now
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
is trying is trying to address that in
 
04:09:50.090 --> 04:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
in November they released a document in
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
regards to their proposal and again
 
04:09:53.450 --> 04:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
they're proposing further restrictions
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
on these materials their public comment
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
period will end in February from for the
 
04:10:00.530 --> 04:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
U.S in United Environmental Protection
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
Agency and then they'll begin their
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
their action as far as what the
 
04:10:06.530 --> 04:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
restrictions how they'll pan out over
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so again United States Environmental
 
04:10:11.689 --> 04:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency requires manufacturers
 
04:10:14.450 --> 04:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
to of pesticides to satisfy certain
 
04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:17.330 align:start position:0%
to of pesticides to satisfy certain
standards

04:10:17.330 --> 04:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.340 --> 04:10:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:19.010 --> 04:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
okay one of the question was asked about
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
did we receive information from the
 
04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
United States uh from the University of
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh vet lab we did receive
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
them but through the
 
04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
um uh New Hampshire Fish and Game did a
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
study on animals that were
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
received through hunting not not through
 
04:10:36.600 --> 04:10:37.490 align:start position:0%
received through hunting not not through
through

04:10:37.490 --> 04:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
um uh contamination of a pesticide but
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
just to see if those animals had these
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
um residues in in them and they did and
 
04:10:47.330 --> 04:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
and I think a 34 out of 36 of those
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
animals identified as having residue
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
um rodenticide residue in them but they
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
weren't that's not what what led them to
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
their demise they were provided as as
 
04:10:59.090 --> 04:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
part of a study another important piece
 
04:11:01.010 --> 04:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
while we're talking about that is to
 
04:11:02.929 --> 04:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
really understand how that residue gets
 
04:11:05.150 --> 04:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
into the animal and actually overwhelms
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
the animal or the bird to to terminate
 
04:11:11.150 --> 04:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
it requires an intensive internal organ
 
04:11:13.610 --> 04:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
um review uh study
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
kidney I'm pretty sure it's a kidney
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and so it's a scientific clinical
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
approach to really identify that that's
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what is the reason why an animal
 
04:11:25.250 --> 04:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
would be terminated from that not
 
04:11:26.809 --> 04:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
doubting that the residue is there the
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
residue is there pretty much any bird or
 
04:11:31.610 --> 04:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
animal that's eating a rat or or a mouse
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
is is more than likely going to get this
 
04:11:33.600 --> 04:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
is is more than likely going to get this
residue

04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
residue
 
04:11:36.530 --> 04:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
um inside them
 
04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned the wildlife activity
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
Federal View and we do have rodent
 
04:11:40.620 --> 04:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
Federal View and we do have rodent
concerns

04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um we have the division of pesticide
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
control has received an increase of Road
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
and concern calls over the last 10 years
 
04:11:51.530 --> 04:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
mainly rats
 
04:11:53.929 --> 04:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
um so these these products are important
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
to that control
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
now our Focus division of pesticide
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
control is pesticides it's the chemical
 
04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
piece but in our training in our
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
training materials
 
04:12:06.050 --> 04:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
um we always identify other methods so
 
04:12:07.550 --> 04:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
we don't just talk about the chemicals
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about trapping we talk about
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
mechanical controls patching holes
 
04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
picking up trash and things like that so
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's all part of this control pieces
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
and it should be we shouldn't just be
 
04:12:19.969 --> 04:12:19.979 align:start position:0%
talking about chemical when we're
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
talking about Road and control so that
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
education piece needs to continue
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and then there was a question about
 
04:12:28.729 --> 04:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
the pesticide control board there are 13
 
04:12:30.650 --> 04:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
members by Statute
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
um the active members are listed on that
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
letter right now and you'll see the name
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
and then the department or the their
 
04:12:36.359 --> 04:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
and then the department or the their
interest

04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
um there are some members that are not
 
04:12:41.330 --> 04:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
on there right now that were in in
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
seeking out to fill and that includes uh
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
two public seats and there is one that
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh showed interest and that's moving
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
ahead there's one that should be there
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
on the representing Municipal interest
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's not on there the medical doctor
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
is the toughest one for us to keep on
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
the board and I I don't know if they've
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's just been a difficult position to
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
keep so that you won't see that um
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
filled right now so outside of those
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
four or five positions there are eight
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
active members currently
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and and again the Boyd has that
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
function of reviewing pesticides and
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
making decisions is whether they'd be
 
04:13:16.189 --> 04:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
further restricted and to that point in
 
04:13:18.410 --> 04:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
the pesticide board's rules the
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
administrative rules of New Hampshire
 
04:13:22.370 --> 04:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
there is a section to put
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
products or pesticide active ingredients
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
when they become restricted so there's
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually a a chapter within the rules
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
itself it's PES 700 but we do have a
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
list of products that are restricted
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
beyond the federal government we also
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
have a listing of products that are
 
04:13:38.150 --> 04:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
banned or active ingredients that are
 
04:13:40.490 --> 04:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
banned uh well let's it's identified as
 
04:13:42.950 --> 04:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited in in the list
 
04:13:44.929 --> 04:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
um I think that's it I there was one
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
other question that was asked I thought
 
04:13:48.530 --> 04:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
oh the number of animals the makeup of
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:13:50.040 --> 04:13:50.689 align:start position:0%
the board
um

04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
the impact if we take away these
 
04:13:52.920 --> 04:13:54.010 align:start position:0%
the impact if we take away these
materials

04:13:54.010 --> 04:13:54.020 align:start position:0%
materials
 
04:13:57.410 --> 04:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
there will be an impact but to put a
 
04:13:59.689 --> 04:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
number on it or identify I I don't I
 
04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:14:01.140 --> 04:14:01.870 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:04.370 --> 04:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
the that's that's that's all I have
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:14:05.880 --> 04:14:07.070 align:start position:0%
right now
yeah

04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
blurry of hands representative Murray
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
new Madam chair for taking my question
 
04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
crash fishing game you mentioned that
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
the original 34 out of the 36 animals
 
04:14:24.650 --> 04:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
that had tested positive for the residue
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
um met their demise some other way part
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
of what I'm also thinking about is
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
obviously fish and game has jurisdiction
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
over hunting
 
04:14:36.410 --> 04:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so to what degree this these
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
if if this is happening and
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
this is an animal that is being consumed
 
04:14:43.370 --> 04:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
by the public and they're testing
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
positive for these things as well in
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
addition to all of the other
 
04:14:47.460 --> 04:14:49.070 align:start position:0%
addition to all of the other
uh

04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
residues that are being noticed in uh
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
eggs and all sorts of other
 
04:14:55.199 --> 04:14:58.010 align:start position:0%
eggs and all sorts of other
um

04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
birds and and whether it's Offspring I I
 
04:15:01.849 --> 04:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:15:04.490 --> 04:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
going back into the 16s and 70s when we
 
04:15:06.170 --> 04:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
talked about DDT and things like that it
 
04:15:08.090 --> 04:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
did transfer into the eggs and there
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
were significant problems with that
 
04:15:12.889 --> 04:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
chemical so I guess what I'm what I'm
 
04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
asking here is
 
04:15:14.760 --> 04:15:15.410 align:start position:0%
asking here is
um

04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
what prompted the initial study and test
 
04:15:20.689 --> 04:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
by Fish and Game to look for this
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
initially and and why I guess great
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
so this has been a concern for a number
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
of years and it's it's been tracked
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
by the United States Environmental
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency has increased their
 
04:15:37.370 --> 04:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
restrictions on rodenticides over time
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
so the last group of restrictions we saw
 
04:15:42.410 --> 04:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
was in 2008. so the studies keep
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
continue so different states different
 
04:15:47.450 --> 04:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
organizations will will study residue
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
and and the impact and that's why we
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
have these recent lists
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
um of proposed restrictions from from
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency it's
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
important to note when you bring up DDT
 
04:16:02.450 --> 04:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
that DDT was a bio accumulator okay
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
these chemicals or not the the second
 
04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulants they're not
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
they don't get stronger or become a high
 
04:16:11.809 --> 04:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
intensity in strength as they go from
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
organism to organism they do transfer we
 
04:16:15.650 --> 04:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
but they don't bioaccumulate and that's
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
an important piece so we shouldn't be
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
comparing the second generation
 
04:16:25.490 --> 04:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
anticoagulanticides to DDT
 
04:16:25.500 --> 04:16:27.050 align:start position:0%
anticoagulanticides to DDT
um

04:16:27.050 --> 04:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:30.010 --> 04:16:30.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I have
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives Stuart um smart
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh Howard I'm looking at
 
04:16:39.050 --> 04:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
the place my my apologies representative
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
Howard no problem thank you
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um I I have three questions actually and
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
one of the the first one is um
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
and and I'll just ask them all in a row
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
and you can just answer them all
 
04:16:52.370 --> 04:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
together the first one is um what would
 
04:16:54.530 --> 04:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
be the harm in having this task force
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
that was suggested by the Audubon
 
04:16:56.340 --> 04:16:57.710 align:start position:0%
that was suggested by the Audubon
Society

04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
Society
 
04:16:59.330 --> 04:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe start a literature
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
review of the science that is out there
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
already because it sounds like
 
04:17:04.610 --> 04:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
each of you are looking at different
 
04:17:08.330 --> 04:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
parts of this of this existing science
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
um and also I wonder uh if uh why not
 
04:17:14.090 --> 04:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
why not err on the side of caution and
 
04:17:16.490 --> 04:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
bet and have a temporary ban while you
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
do the science in case you find out that
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
it is as lethal as or as harmful as as
 
04:17:26.090 --> 04:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
the bill claims right
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and I guess there was only two
 
04:17:27.720 --> 04:17:31.189 align:start position:0%
um and I guess there was only two
questions

04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the task force I think is a great great
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion and and a number of the
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
um uh Ms Foss had recommended uh
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
including the Diagnostic lab and some of
 
04:17:42.769 --> 04:17:42.779 align:start position:0%
these rehabilitator folks and I think
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would work well
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that those individuals
 
04:17:49.250 --> 04:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
on February 6 the Boyd has a meeting
 
04:17:52.490 --> 04:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
February 6 9 30 room 201 approached the
 
04:17:52.500 --> 04:17:53.570 align:start position:0%
February 6 9 30 room 201 approached the
Boyd

04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
Boyd
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I and that this topic is on the
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
board's agenda as it has been
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
rodenticide and and and we could we the
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
boy at the boards I'm not on the board
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
but they could at least listen to that
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion and and maybe come up with a
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
work group that would that would you
 
04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
know could meet on a regular basis the
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
division division could certainly
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
facilitate the meetings we're willing to
 
04:18:15.769 --> 04:18:15.779 align:start position:0%
do that the literature review it it is
 
04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
um there is quite a bit out there
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and that's why I said we're not
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
denying that there's residue out there
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
is uh quite a bit of information as far
 
04:18:24.840 --> 04:18:25.969 align:start position:0%
is uh quite a bit of information as far
as

04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
erring on the side of cautioning and
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
having a moratorium
 
04:18:31.610 --> 04:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
again I think that's something that
 
04:18:33.530 --> 04:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
should go through the board
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I know California has done has done
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
that on a number of these these second
 
04:18:38.450 --> 04:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulants I don't know
 
04:18:39.889 --> 04:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
where they stand right now as far as
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
their experience with going to that
 
04:18:41.520 --> 04:18:43.070 align:start position:0%
their experience with going to that
moratorium

04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but that that's certainly a point to
 
04:18:44.640 --> 04:18:47.570 align:start position:0%
um but that that's certainly a point to
consider

04:18:47.570 --> 04:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Davis
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you Mr
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
Russo for taking my question
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how they apply this is
 
04:19:00.110 --> 04:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
it is it like a commercial
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
application or
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a number of different
 
04:19:06.889 --> 04:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
products rodenticides probably the most
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
common ones
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
um from the for the commercial
 
04:19:11.150 --> 04:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
applicator they usually use traps bait
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
traps and then and they fill those traps
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
with their they look like blocks like uh
 
04:19:18.170 --> 04:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
broken pieces of chalk if you will fit
 
04:19:20.570 --> 04:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
in a box about this size they put around
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
a structure the animal goes in there it
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
takes the debate and then and then you
 
04:19:28.370 --> 04:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
know goes off and then the the homeowner
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
and what EPA has really tried to push to
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
do is get it in a a container that is a
 
04:19:36.050 --> 04:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
one one one use only and it's not you're
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
not you shouldn't be fussing with the
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
blocks it's already in the container the
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
problem with that is
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
the internet in a big way that they they
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
we they have you can you can buy pretty
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
much anything that's that's available
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
that was intended to for example for an
 
04:19:50.450 --> 04:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
agriculturist the farmer may buy
 
04:19:52.729 --> 04:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
something in an 18 pound container that
 
04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
is those blocks
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's pretty much what epa's
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on now is get that away
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
from the residential use by homeowners
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of delivery meth
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
methods there's the commercial
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
applicator that that uses that method I
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
identified as The Bait Box and there's a
 
04:20:09.290 --> 04:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
homeowner that should only be using the
 
04:20:10.729 --> 04:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
ones that are ready to use and throw
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
away type
 
04:20:14.210 --> 04:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
um and and then there are some uh some
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.319 --> 04:20:19.849 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:20:22.130 --> 04:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
I I want to touch on what representative
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
Murray had said if if this is uh
 
04:20:29.929 --> 04:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
like animals are you tested 34 out of 36
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
they had residue how would that affect a
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
hunter that may not test the animal
 
04:20:38.210 --> 04:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
shoot something and eat it uh something
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
that had that residue would how would
 
04:20:41.330 --> 04:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
that affect a human
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I um so the
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
residue is supposed to be at such a
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
level If the product pesticide was used
 
04:20:49.969 --> 04:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
in the coins with this label uh properly
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a problem
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see some some
 
04:20:55.010 --> 04:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
information on that some data and I
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have anything to add
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
Bob on that one no
 
04:21:00.889 --> 04:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
yeah so it clearly gets transferred
 
04:21:03.290 --> 04:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
um but uh but it depends on what part of
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the typical part that you're eating
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the animal anyway is not the internal
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
organs I know some people do eat them
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
but the the meat of it themselves that
 
04:21:14.689 --> 04:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be transferred to for example
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
muscle or the the most common types of
 
04:21:19.010 --> 04:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
meat that people will eat but I don't
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
know I can't give you any numbers with
 
04:21:22.330 --> 04:21:22.340 align:start position:0%
that for sure all right thank you
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:21:28.849 --> 04:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
um do you know if any other states have
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
banned this
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
California is the only state that I'm
 
04:21:34.130 --> 04:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
aware of that put a moratorium on it now
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
you will see in literature and online
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
that it's been banned but it's it's a
 
04:21:42.050 --> 04:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.450 --> 04:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh and the line of questioning there um
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
if there is this concern and I I know
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to the moratorium is
 
04:21:59.450 --> 04:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
there someone from fish and game here
 
04:22:04.250 --> 04:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.260 --> 04:22:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
nope

04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.199 --> 04:22:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:14.760 --> 04:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um is there an opportunity at Madam
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair what is the procedure if there are
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions to reach out to fish and game
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh well I guess we can uh ask the
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee researcher to find out some
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
information for us yep any other
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
questions representative germana thank
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh thank you uh so I
 
04:22:41.570 --> 04:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
appreciate I understand as you said
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
before you can't quantify what the
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
impact would be if we all of a sudden we
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
put a moratorium on this right if we
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
didn't use these products uh but I'm
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
wondering given the exceptions that are
 
04:22:55.729 --> 04:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill right which include
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural production uh I'm wondering
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
if those exceptions would apply to a
 
04:23:04.969 --> 04:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
significant number of important
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
applications of a pesticide like this so
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned about the impact on
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
the state's agriculture which of course
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
we should be that there are exceptions
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
for that here so do the exceptions
 
04:23:21.050 --> 04:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill provide a significant
 
04:23:21.060 --> 04:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill provide a significant
um

04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh amount of these kinds of products
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
that are used in the state because
 
04:23:30.290 --> 04:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
you're also speaking forward in answer
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
to representative Davis's first question
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
about the difference between commercial
 
04:23:35.090 --> 04:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
application as opposed to something
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
somebody buys off uh off Amazon uh it
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
would seem to me in terms of commercial
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
application things like agricultural
 
04:23:43.729 --> 04:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
production would make up a significant
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
amount of the usage of some of these
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
pesticides so what are these exceptions
 
04:23:50.330 --> 04:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
do you think sufficient
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we had on the
 
04:23:53.570 --> 04:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
agricultural exception it says an
 
04:23:55.610 --> 04:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
agricultural food production site and so
 
04:23:58.370 --> 04:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
is is that does that mean of any kind of
 
04:24:01.729 --> 04:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
food that's being grown I I think that a
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
definition would be helpful as far as
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
what they mean by agricultural food
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
production site and the availability of
 
04:24:09.769 --> 04:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
the products because it's also in that
 
04:24:11.689 --> 04:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
same sentence as listed slaughterhouse
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
or Cannery so I don't know really how
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
this exception would would apply across
 
04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.769 --> 04:24:23.779 align:start position:0%
any other questions I oh representative
 
04:24:27.769 --> 04:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative smart
 
04:24:30.650 --> 04:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
I was I was just wondering if there was
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
a minimum efficacy dose for any of these
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
second Generations because like with the
 
04:24:40.729 --> 04:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
majority of things
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
um there is a weight that you do your
 
04:24:47.210 --> 04:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
dosage by so if we are
 
04:24:50.929 --> 04:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
giving mice a dosage to kill a mouse
 
04:24:53.870 --> 04:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily be a dose you know
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
like you you say you have animals with
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
residue in their system obviously it's
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
not enough to kill them so is there a
 
04:25:03.410 --> 04:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
dosage I wasn't able to find one I was
 
04:25:05.150 --> 04:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
able to find um
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
the percentage of what was in I'm
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
that that's my question
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
so the the manufacturer has to identify
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
to the federal government what dosage
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
that they recommend
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
I can speak to bromothalan which is a
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
non-anticoagulant but it represents the
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
level of of dosage and inactive
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
ingredient it's
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
.005 yeah and then that you know is is
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
very little how that transfers to if it
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
ended up an animal and we eat the animal
 
04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
what that what that residue would be
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
like I don't I don't know
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
foreign Bixby
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
yes so um I'm wondering if there has
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
been uh you mentioned that with first
 
04:25:55.250 --> 04:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
generation rodenticides there had been
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that uh the uh the rat
 
04:26:01.610 --> 04:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
population was gaining resistance to
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
them and uh so I have a couple of
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions about that development of
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
resistance first of all
 
04:26:12.889 --> 04:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
um is there evidence of resistance
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
developing for the second generation
 
04:26:20.090 --> 04:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants and uh if there is that
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
gen if there is resistance developing in
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
the Target population of rats uh would
 
04:26:28.610 --> 04:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
it be reasonable to expect that that
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
resistance would not develop in the rat
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
Predators who might eat them and then be
 
04:26:37.550 --> 04:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware I'm sure there's studies
 
04:26:42.769 --> 04:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
out there on Resistance from
 
04:26:47.330 --> 04:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
to uh secondary anticoagulants
 
04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
um I think that's an awesome question
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
about the animal that eats that prey
 
04:26:55.849 --> 04:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
will they become resistant or does it is
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
it is it more of a um an impact
 
04:27:01.370 --> 04:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
situation I I don't know I I don't know
 
04:27:03.170 --> 04:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay I I have a question and then I'll
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
go to your representative.c so my
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
question is if if these substances were
 
04:27:10.319 --> 04:27:12.410 align:start position:0%
question is if if these substances were
banned

04:27:12.410 --> 04:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
banned
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
um would we have to resort to using more
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
toxic substances to eliminate
 
04:27:19.560 --> 04:27:21.649 align:start position:0%
toxic substances to eliminate
rodents

04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
rodents
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
I would say more than likely because you
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking away the second generation
 
04:27:28.969 --> 04:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
well the first generation is probably
 
04:27:31.610 --> 04:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
not as toxic or but it but it takes more
 
04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
dosing for the first generation so
 
04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
they're around in the environment longer
 
04:27:37.969 --> 04:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
than the second generation if people
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the second generation
 
04:27:41.170 --> 04:27:41.180 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants and they jump to the
 
04:27:43.250 --> 04:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
non-anticcoagulants some of the
 
04:27:46.370 --> 04:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
non-integer wildlands are more toxic
 
04:27:49.389 --> 04:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
than the second generation
 
04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
do you have anything further oh go ahead
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
if I could speak um yeah so the first
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulants
 
04:27:59.090 --> 04:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um as we heard before took several
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
feedings so that animal was exposed more
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
and more and so there was a buildup of
 
04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
resistance uh as far as what we'd rely
 
04:28:10.370 --> 04:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
on uh the uh budget review of this bill
 
04:28:13.010 --> 04:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
talked about trapping and you could
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
Institute trapping it's much more
 
04:28:18.410 --> 04:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
expensive uh what we try to educate our
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
operators and the public about is
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management which relies
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
on things other than just using baiting
 
04:28:28.130 --> 04:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
which would include exclusion and that
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
types of things but several these
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
approaches aren't necessarily that
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
practical in a farming situation or even
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
a residential tenant housing those types
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
of things where you have multiple
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
families uh so
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we took away Senate second generation
 
04:28:46.010 --> 04:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants there are other options
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
available zinc phosphide's one uh
 
04:28:52.370 --> 04:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
there's a nerve agent that's one the
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
problem with those chemicals or the
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
nerve agent is there actually isn't an
 
04:28:56.640 --> 04:28:57.769 align:start position:0%
nerve agent is there actually isn't an
antidote

04:28:57.769 --> 04:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
antidote
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh for the anticoagulant pesticides
 
04:29:03.050 --> 04:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
there's uh antidote vitamin K can be
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
administered for instance if a pet is it
 
04:29:08.450 --> 04:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
is exposed so there's obviously balances
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
pluses and minuses to all these options
 
04:29:10.620 --> 04:29:12.050 align:start position:0%
pluses and minuses to all these options
so

04:29:12.050 --> 04:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative datsy uh yes
 
04:29:17.570 --> 04:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
um if these pesticides are so effective
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
why are we receiving more inquiries
 
04:29:26.210 --> 04:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
regarding increases in
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
um pest in rodents
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good question if they're so
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
effective why are we seeing a decline in
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the rodents uh
 
04:29:38.090 --> 04:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I I don't know we
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
we do see and we do receive an increase
 
04:29:41.929 --> 04:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
in calls and and I've heard from Health
 
04:29:41.939 --> 04:29:43.610 align:start position:0%
in calls and and I've heard from Health
departments

04:29:43.610 --> 04:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
um people aren't as diligent as they
 
04:29:47.210 --> 04:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
were in the urban centers as far as
 
04:29:49.010 --> 04:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
getting the trash moved out
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
um there was a someone had identified a
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually a fire chief who was also a
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
public health identified to me that
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
during covert people home war and you'd
 
04:29:59.450 --> 04:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
think that they'd be doing more be
 
04:30:01.010 --> 04:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
diligent to pick up but for some reason
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
they felt like the trash was increasing
 
04:30:05.689 --> 04:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
and home so I don't I don't really know
 
04:30:07.969 --> 04:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
what what the answer is as far as the uh
 
04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
the increase in rats but there are so
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
many different traps and and available
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
um the city of Boston instituted one
 
04:30:18.410 --> 04:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's an electronic trap that electrifies
 
04:30:20.090 --> 04:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
the you know the road it drops it in the
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
box and you clean out the box there's a
 
04:30:25.010 --> 04:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
one that's put into um in the bigger
 
04:30:27.170 --> 04:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
cities like New York City Chicago they
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
have um dry ice which you have to cover
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
up all the holes all the ins and and and
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
that that works in an urban setting but
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
but not
 
04:30:37.849 --> 04:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
um we just I don't I don't know why uh I
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
was struggling with as many rats and as
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:30:45.410 --> 04:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh first representative Potenza and then
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
a completely foreign subject for I think
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
for a lot of us so to just try to I may
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
dump it down to me could you in a in a
 
04:31:02.269 --> 04:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
nutshell tell me where we're
 
04:31:06.530 --> 04:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
experiencing the the greatest rat and
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
mice issues across the state
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
yeah sure this gets uncomfortable for me
 
04:31:13.490 --> 04:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
when um about 10 years ago I can tell
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
you there were coastal towns cities okay
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
and then we started seeing I got called
 
04:31:20.570 --> 04:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
I actually had a call from a pesticide
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
applicator he said he's done with rats
 
04:31:24.170 --> 04:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
and and that call came from
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
um more of a rural kind of um 5000
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
population in a community that was
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
central New Hampshire
 
04:31:35.689 --> 04:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
um and and but it lately the last two to
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
three years it's been pretty much
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.729 --> 04:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question
 
04:31:50.929 --> 04:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of information thrown
 
04:31:54.290 --> 04:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
out here today regarding this and
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
 
04:31:56.640 --> 04:31:57.830 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
s

04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
s
 
04:32:01.130 --> 04:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
second generation is not allowed for
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
Homeowner use is that correct
 
04:32:05.330 --> 04:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's not supposed to be used by
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
homeowners the problem is they they can
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
purchase it
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair and
 
04:32:14.689 --> 04:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
um when you say they can purchase it is
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
that through online means I would say
 
04:32:20.570 --> 04:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
online in in addition Farm Stores you
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
know they'll have a five gallon pail
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
bucket and
 
04:32:27.110 --> 04:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I suppose it could maybe it's a label
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
violation that's something we could Step
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
Up um we're not in the you know we don't
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
go to in the houses you know I mean we
 
04:32:34.969 --> 04:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
could but we we don't you know typically
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
we're watching the complaints and the
 
04:32:40.610 --> 04:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:32:44.090 --> 04:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
in listening to the testimony it
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
is that the first generation written
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
decides the rodent needs to ingest a lot
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
more poison into the system before it
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
um dies and from and maybe I'm not
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly but it
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
would seem that if a raptor or an animal
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
ate someone something with the first
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
generation that has a lot more poison in
 
04:33:15.529 --> 04:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
it it would be much more detrimental
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
than the second generation I'm just
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:33:18.359 --> 04:33:19.849 align:start position:0%
trying to
uh

04:33:19.849 --> 04:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
discern that yeah and you'll find
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
studies first generation Second
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
Generation and noni anticoagulants as
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
residue in animals but
 
04:33:31.810 --> 04:33:31.820 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
04:33:34.010 --> 04:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
terminating animals in the in the level
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
again as a commissioner mentioned we
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
haven't been presented with a clinical
 
04:33:41.150 --> 04:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
04:33:45.650 --> 04:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question I guess a
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
little a point of concern I did have was
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
just in your recent testimony where
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying that in in fact
 
04:33:53.160 --> 04:33:54.490 align:start position:0%
you're saying that in in fact
um

04:33:54.490 --> 04:33:54.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
non-licensed professionals homeowners
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
are having access to five gallon buckets
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
of this stuff in a farm store supply
 
04:34:07.131 --> 04:34:07.141 align:start position:0%
store how is that happening
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the to the quantity in that in a
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
five gallon quantity is is that
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
something that your board has oversight
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
over or how does that get into those
 
04:34:21.051 --> 04:34:21.061 align:start position:0%
stores for sale sure
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
um the way this this uh whole topic was
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
approached and reviewed by EPA in like
 
04:34:31.730 --> 04:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
2008 and one of their strategies was to
 
04:34:36.051 --> 04:34:36.061 align:start position:0%
reduce uh private purchase of res of
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
these second Generations by increasing
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
the quantity size to make them
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
non-marketable to Consumers at the
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
homeowner level
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
um but it didn't go as far as making
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
them restricted a restricted pesticide
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
is something that a certified applicator
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
can uh have the privilege of purchasing
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
a homeowner could not do that so as part
 
04:34:58.970 --> 04:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
of this uh review that EPA is doing now
 
04:35:01.131 --> 04:35:01.141 align:start position:0%
it would actually make all of these
 
04:35:03.010 --> 04:35:03.020 align:start position:0%
second generation
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants restricted regardless of
 
04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
the container that they were in that
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
they would be in and they would be
 
04:35:14.209 --> 04:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
prohibited from uh purchased by uh
 
04:35:17.090 --> 04:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
non-certified applicators so that that
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
was kind of a problem
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
um the uh the fact that they're not
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
restricted makes them available for
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
purchase even if you know a homeowner
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
could purchase large quantities thank
 
04:35:31.369 --> 04:35:31.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
04:35:34.561 --> 04:35:35.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
um

04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:37.970 --> 04:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh this is a kind of a two-part question
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
one is
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
um do you know how soon the EPA is
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
likely to actually act on uh making
 
04:35:46.320 --> 04:35:47.689 align:start position:0%
likely to actually act on uh making
these

04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
um restricted use and would it be
 
04:35:52.730 --> 04:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
possible for us to make them restricted
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
use at the state level before the EPA
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
on the first part of the question
 
04:36:04.369 --> 04:36:04.379 align:start position:0%
I would say no less than six months to a
 
04:36:06.650 --> 04:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
year on the EPA level the comment period
 
04:36:08.209 --> 04:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
from the public closes next month
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
February and then they I'm pretty sure
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
they have a 90-day required time frame
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
to review
 
04:36:16.730 --> 04:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
um so that's three months um so any you
 
04:36:18.410 --> 04:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
know I my my best guess would be
 
04:36:20.090 --> 04:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
anywhere from six months to a year at
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
EPA level could the state move ahead and
 
04:36:22.439 --> 04:36:23.689 align:start position:0%
EPA level could the state move ahead and
restrict

04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
um in that method yeah we the board
 
04:36:28.449 --> 04:36:28.459 align:start position:0%
could could move ahead and do that um
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
certainly not without discussion and
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and and and looking the board would
 
04:36:34.970 --> 04:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
probably look at what the federal
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
government is is doing and and more than
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
likely follow the the Federal
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
approach because if the state goes ahead
 
04:36:44.449 --> 04:36:44.459 align:start position:0%
and restricts them and it it doesn't
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
match up with the federal restriction
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
and then we end up with different
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
um compliance requirements both federal
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and state that that sometimes gets a
 
04:36:56.890 --> 04:36:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
04:37:01.250 --> 04:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you um I have sort
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
of a two-part question if that's okay
 
04:37:04.730 --> 04:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner wrote in his letter
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
there were done decide concern is a
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
current topic for the board so I wonder
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
if you could just speak to the board's
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
path on addressing the rodenticide and
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
what the timeline for that looks like
 
04:37:16.490 --> 04:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding what's going on with the
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
EPA and second to that is what sort of
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions does the pesticide control
 
04:37:23.209 --> 04:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
board normally do and is there a way
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the board itself could think
 
04:37:27.890 --> 04:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
um sort of holistically about how just
 
04:37:30.289 --> 04:37:30.299 align:start position:0%
reducing the usage of this so I mean in
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
one piece would be reducing individuals
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
using it but other ways should just
 
04:37:38.330 --> 04:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
reduce the use of these these pesticides
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sure does that make sense yeah
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
well I I think I got it uh the Boyd has
 
04:37:44.929 --> 04:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
has full Authority
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
um under the statute to do as they need
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh see fit in as far as restrictions or
 
04:37:50.219 --> 04:37:52.010 align:start position:0%
uh see fit in as far as restrictions or
prohibition

04:37:52.010 --> 04:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
04:37:53.631 --> 04:37:53.641 align:start position:0%
um I missed the first part I'm so sorry
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
I um I think it was just like a little
 
04:37:57.650 --> 04:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
more information on the commissioner's
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
sentence the Redundant side concern is
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
the current topic for the board yeah
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um so last year the the
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
governor's office directed the
 
04:38:07.369 --> 04:38:07.379 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to track
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
incidents of of residue whether they be
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
um the residues that we're seeing right
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
now or if there were a situation where
 
04:38:17.929 --> 04:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
an animal was terminated but the
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
governor's office made it clear that we
 
04:38:21.410 --> 04:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
would track
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
but the department would track
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
incidents of rodenticide and so that was
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
brought to the board you know the
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
department received the information from
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
the governor in turn the department
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
identified to the board that they need
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
to um it needs to be a topic and so
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for at least six
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe eight months
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
and as far as the timeline goes I I
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a timeline put as
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
far as saying okay you know we've looked
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
at it for a year and and we're done I I
 
04:38:48.840 --> 04:38:50.570 align:start position:0%
at it for a year and and we're done I I
I don't

04:38:50.570 --> 04:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no timeline as far as
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
the decision making I think one of the
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
things that plays into this is these
 
04:38:57.170 --> 04:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagans have been
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
around since the 1970s and so that
 
04:39:02.570 --> 04:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
that becomes part of the question is
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to have a residue
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're better at examining things now and
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
identifying the chemical chemicals we're
 
04:39:09.180 --> 04:39:10.250 align:start position:0%
identifying the chemical chemicals we're
finding

04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
finding
 
04:39:11.570 --> 04:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
um but what does it mean you know and I
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
think that that that's a big question
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the board could wrap
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
that up in a year as far as what they've
 
04:39:20.449 --> 04:39:20.459 align:start position:0%
how they feel uh uh what their response
 
04:39:23.090 --> 04:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:39:27.650 --> 04:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes it occurs to me that we're talking
 
04:39:30.650 --> 04:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
about restricted use and we have a
 
04:39:32.449 --> 04:39:32.459 align:start position:0%
number of new members here this year so
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
I maybe you could explain what
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
restricted use means oh thank you um
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
so in the classification of pesticides
 
04:39:41.090 --> 04:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has four
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
classifications and this is a real
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
General and the first one is General
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
General use you might refer to it as
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
over the counter it's something most
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
anybody can buy it's a general use type
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
material so the level of toxicity is
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
such that it's it's a it's it's
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
available for use by a homeowner so
 
04:39:59.090 --> 04:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's typically the general use
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
um then when you bump up either the way
 
04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
a product is used or its toxicity is
 
04:40:05.630 --> 04:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
elevated that becomes a restricted use
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
pesticide and sometimes a manufacturer
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
can take what would normally be a
 
04:40:10.970 --> 04:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
general use and make it restricted
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
because they want it to be used by a
 
04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
commercial licensed applicator so you
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
have General use you have restricted use
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
then you have this group called The
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited limited use and those are
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
real specific uses there's only about a
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
dozen of them I would say half of them
 
04:40:26.810 --> 04:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
are for bird control and and the
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited limited use the use of them
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
requires something called a special
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
permit so it's not just a licensed
 
04:40:34.670 --> 04:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
individual could use it they would have
 
04:40:36.050 --> 04:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
to use it under a certain number of
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
clear specific provisions and then the
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
last classification is prohibited and
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:40:50.100 --> 04:40:52.670 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Potenza

04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
Potenza
 
04:40:55.610 --> 04:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
so this this basically goes um kind of a
 
04:40:57.530 --> 04:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up to our question when you were
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
the question that I asked um to the
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner was about how you know what
 
04:41:10.130 --> 04:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
are the numbers of animals that um have
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
been terminated and we're saying zero at
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
this point correct
 
04:41:17.330 --> 04:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have not received a
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire animal with clinical
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
information to say clearly that an
 
04:41:23.810 --> 04:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
animal was terminated due to pesticide
 
04:41:23.820 --> 04:41:25.250 align:start position:0%
animal was terminated due to pesticide
use

04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
so this is this is where to me it would
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
be how hard it would be that would mean
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
someone in their backyard that had
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's that sees a dead animal fox or
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever would have to report it for
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
then to for it to be tested so we really
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
don't know those numbers of how many
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
animals that are deceased from this
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
correct I mean that's a fear yeah I
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
would say it's for you can I follow up
 
04:41:50.100 --> 04:41:52.310 align:start position:0%
would say it's for you can I follow up
yes

04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:41:52.320 --> 04:41:53.230 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:41:53.230 --> 04:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
in regards with purchasing
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
um so could someone could go on Amazon
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
or something like that in even though
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
it's prohibited for
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
alcohol and all those other types of
 
04:42:05.930 --> 04:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
things are all controlled like you can't
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
send I can't go buy somebody a gift
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
package and send a wine basket to a
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain in it automatically says
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
prohibited in these states we we can't
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
have any sort of controls over that
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're for people that are like a
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
homeowner that's going to be buying
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
something that's prohibited is that just
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
really so hard to control like in an
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
online fashion I know if we're talking
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
about farm stores and all these other
 
04:42:29.690 --> 04:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
things you guys I mean there's not that
 
04:42:31.128 --> 04:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
many people to be able to police this
 
04:42:32.448 --> 04:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and controlling
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
businesses is very difficult I can
 
04:42:36.288 --> 04:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
imagine so
 
04:42:36.298 --> 04:42:37.628 align:start position:0%
imagine so
um

04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah policing the uh the sale
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be difficult
 
04:42:45.288 --> 04:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
um typically we when we find a homeowner
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
with a product that they that they
 
04:42:48.770 --> 04:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
legally shouldn't be using
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
um it's usually a neighbor complaint I
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:42:53.930 --> 04:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
um but as far as looking at what people
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
buy and how they're using that product
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
Okay so I have a question
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
if I may maybe this is a question for
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
fish and game people but so these second
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
generation anticoagulants have been used
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
since the 1970s this is what I'm hearing
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
has there been a significant decline in
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Predator population since then or
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
during this time period
 
04:43:29.090 --> 04:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't be
 
04:43:31.490 --> 04:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable putting that number on that
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
but we we've seen an increase in Birds
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
of Prey over overall with with eagles if
 
04:43:38.330 --> 04:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
you if you're talking back to 1970 and
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
when DDT was uh taken off the shelves in
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
1972 And we have seen an increase in
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
that in that that bird of prey but um I
 
04:43:48.530 --> 04:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
I couldn't speak to uh you know all
 
04:43:50.208 --> 04:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
populations across the board as far as
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
whether increasing or decreasing except
 
04:43:55.930 --> 04:43:55.940 align:start position:0%
the rats yeah yeah
 
04:43:58.128 --> 04:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
representative come to my you had a
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you madam chair and
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you director again for taking my
 
04:44:03.360 --> 04:44:04.550 align:start position:0%
thank you director again for taking my
question

04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:44:06.890 --> 04:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that
 
04:44:06.900 --> 04:44:08.208 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that
um

04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:12.530 --> 04:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
education I think is the way to go with
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
um this is there something that the
 
04:44:16.250 --> 04:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
department is doing on educating the
 
04:44:19.730 --> 04:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
public regarding rodenticides so when
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing these products they
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
understand what effects it can have even
 
04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
on their pets
 
04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
when we learned when the department
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
learned of the the eagle death in
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in 2021 directly related
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
to the second generation anticoagulant
 
04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
we put up a web page but you know how
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
web web is you know you're either going
 
04:44:38.570 --> 04:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
to find it or you're not find it but
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's an educational piece in that
 
04:44:42.530 --> 04:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
description you can look at it when you
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
get a chance it identifies other methods
 
04:44:46.730 --> 04:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
of control
 
04:44:48.410 --> 04:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
um other than going jump into the it
 
04:44:50.570 --> 04:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
says right in the in and Bob you're
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
gonna have to help me out on this one
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure we say in there consider
 
04:44:56.810 --> 04:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
non-chemical methods or consider you
 
04:44:58.490 --> 04:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
know trapping before going to chemistry
 
04:45:00.288 --> 04:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where we are as far as
 
04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
a little piece of of Education we do
 
04:45:04.850 --> 04:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
have it on our environmental page which
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
is um in our division of pesticide
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
control page and I'm sure it's not the
 
04:45:10.970 --> 04:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
first thing people would would turn over
 
04:45:13.610 --> 04:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
as far as when you go on the on the web
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
but but it is it is there as I mentioned
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
when we do trainings we always identify
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
the uh the methods that are non-chemical
 
04:45:23.690 --> 04:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um and we do get calls from the public
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
we got a call
 
04:45:28.490 --> 04:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
um where uh a husband had ordered a
 
04:45:31.010 --> 04:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
treatment using the chemical method and
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
the wife said you get back on that phone
 
04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
and you tell them we're not we're not
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
going to do that and and so it became a
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
contractual problem between the family
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the the company they hired because
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
they signed into it and then the the the
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
wife said we're going to go with
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
trapping and and not chemicals so that's
 
04:45:49.010 --> 04:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
another piece of um opportunity we have
 
04:45:50.750 --> 04:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
to say okay that's a that's a that's a
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
method you know that's a lot of
 
04:45:53.570 --> 04:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
representative come to our follow-up
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair thank you and again
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you director
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I was just noticing that you had said
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
um antidotes
 
04:46:08.410 --> 04:46:08.420 align:start position:0%
um for the second generation
 
04:46:12.010 --> 04:46:12.020 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants however for some of the
 
04:46:14.810 --> 04:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
non-anticoagulants there are no
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
antidotes is that in regards to poison
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
control in humans or animals
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
so on on the pesticide labels there's
 
04:46:26.930 --> 04:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
usually typically notes to veterinarians
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
where they're dealing with a homeowner
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
pet that might have been exposed to a
 
04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
rodenticide and
 
04:46:36.550 --> 04:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
um if you see information on a
 
04:46:38.930 --> 04:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
anticoagulant label it'll talk about
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
administering vitamin K as a as an
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
antidote when you're talking about the
 
04:46:46.810 --> 04:46:46.820 align:start position:0%
the nerve agents that are not
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants there really is no
 
04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
antidote and so
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically a wait and watch and see
 
04:46:56.570 --> 04:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
and hope that hope for the best uh with
 
04:46:59.448 --> 04:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
some of these other approaches
 
04:47:03.170 --> 04:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
the rodenticide control thank you
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:47:08.090 --> 04:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
no seeing none
 
04:47:09.770 --> 04:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
today we appreciate all your information
 
04:47:15.530 --> 04:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Representative will
 
04:47:17.638 --> 04:47:30.110 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Representative will
Darby

04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.680 --> 04:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam thank you madam chair
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
letting me testify
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to relate an abbreviated
 
04:47:46.200 --> 04:47:47.208 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to relate an abbreviated
incident

04:47:47.208 --> 04:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
incident
 
04:47:49.208 --> 04:47:49.218 align:start position:0%
um my family experience that is a result
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
of second generation any coagulant
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
rodenticides such as those prohibited by
 
04:47:56.570 --> 04:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
which led me to co-sponsoring this boom
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
my family lives in Nashua with
 
04:48:04.190 --> 04:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
neighboring houses on all sides and a
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
fully fenced in yard
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
we like to let our dogs out in the
 
04:48:09.230 --> 04:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
backyard and they enjoy the interaction
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
with other dogs beyond the fence
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
several years ago our dog Casper
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
about 20 pounds was out as normal before
 
04:48:17.100 --> 04:48:17.930 align:start position:0%
about 20 pounds was out as normal before
bed

04:48:17.930 --> 04:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
bed
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night he awoke and
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
was sick in the corner of the room
 
04:48:24.770 --> 04:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
when my wife checked on him
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
she observed a small mostly intact
 
04:48:29.690 --> 04:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
rodent in the vomit
 
04:48:31.730 --> 04:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
which she disposed of while cleaning up
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
the mess
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
we did not think much of the event but
 
04:48:37.550 --> 04:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
when we awoke in the morning Casper was
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
lethargic we monitor them throughout the
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
day and noticed he stopped eating and
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
slept the entire day
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
the following day we brought him to the
 
04:48:48.050 --> 04:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
vet and we were and we're told that he
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
probably had a stomach issue and he was
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
put on a special diet
 
04:48:54.170 --> 04:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
he continued to refuse food even when
 
04:48:57.170 --> 04:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
hand fed so my wife asked that I work
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
from home the following day
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
to continue checking on his progress
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
at some point well while I was
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
attempting to feed him I noticed his
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
gums were bleeding
 
04:49:08.810 --> 04:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
calling the vet again they indicated it
 
04:49:10.490 --> 04:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
was critical that he'd be seen
 
04:49:10.500 --> 04:49:12.610 align:start position:0%
was critical that he'd be seen
immediately

04:49:12.610 --> 04:49:12.620 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
with this additional symptom they
 
04:49:17.208 --> 04:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
conducted more blood tests
 
04:49:18.770 --> 04:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
these determined that he had consumed
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
rodents rodenticide and required a
 
04:49:23.448 --> 04:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
vitamin K infusion
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
we were besides ourselves
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
not using Rhode Island sides at home we
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
wondered how we would come into contact
 
04:49:32.448 --> 04:49:32.458 align:start position:0%
until my wife recalled the regurgitated
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
mouse from a few nights earlier
 
04:49:37.010 --> 04:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
Casper had to stay in the veterinary
 
04:49:39.770 --> 04:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
hospital for two days and be kept on
 
04:49:42.530 --> 04:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
vitamin K for two additional weeks
 
04:49:44.810 --> 04:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
we were relieved that our dear boy was
 
04:49:44.820 --> 04:49:45.708 align:start position:0%
we were relieved that our dear boy was
saved

04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
saved
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
even if we were out fifteen hundred
 
04:49:47.520 --> 04:49:49.070 align:start position:0%
even if we were out fifteen hundred
dollars

04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
an expense and an incident that could
 
04:49:53.570 --> 04:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
have been avoided if our neighbors had
 
04:49:55.550 --> 04:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
selected an alternative solution to
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
their managing their pest problem that
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
was less toxic to non-target species
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
even in Nashua we have Hawks and owls
 
04:50:05.810 --> 04:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
visit semi-regularly
 
04:50:08.330 --> 04:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
if our dog surrounded by a fenced in
 
04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
yard can ingest a poisoned Mouse and
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
nearly die
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
these birds of prey are much more prone
 
04:50:15.410 --> 04:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
to such recklessness
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote ought to pass on this
 
04:50:19.368 --> 04:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
04:50:22.250 --> 04:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:50:26.690 --> 04:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative um
 
04:50:32.690 --> 04:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me based on your testimony
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
that time was of the essence as to when
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
the vitamin K got administered based on
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
your recount of the veterinarian
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
urging you to bring the pet in
 
04:50:46.128 --> 04:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
imminently that's that's what they
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
relate to us that we had that he had to
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
come in immediately
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and which is which is what we did yes
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I may sure and are you
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
aware of there being a a sort of and
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a question for somebody
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
else but
 
04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
um what is the time frame in which post
 
04:51:08.448 --> 04:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
ingesting it an animal does have to seek
 
04:51:10.610 --> 04:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
treatment is that within hours within a
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
day two days all I can tell I mean I've
 
04:51:15.890 --> 04:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
read right that that demise may live
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
several days but I I can't I'm not a
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
better uh veterinarian
 
04:51:23.930 --> 04:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:26.448 --> 04:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and

I'd like to call uh Rob Johnson from New
 
04:51:53.230 --> 04:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Rob Johnson
 
04:51:58.670 --> 04:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Farm
 
04:52:00.410 --> 04:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
Bureau is the federation's policy
 
04:52:00.420 --> 04:52:04.430 align:start position:0%
Bureau is the federation's policy
director

04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.050 --> 04:52:08.060 align:start position:0%
we don't disagree with the importance of
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
rodents that have to the food chain for
 
04:52:12.890 --> 04:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
wildlife No Doubt
 
04:52:14.690 --> 04:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
and as I think you any of you have
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
reviewed the bill you're aware that it
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
it provides exemptions for agriculture
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
but as we previously said we are very
 
04:52:25.250 --> 04:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
much opposed to the bill
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
there's an established process for this
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
type of discussion and decision making
 
04:52:31.270 --> 04:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
in your wisdom the legislature before
 
04:52:36.890 --> 04:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
you back in the mid 80s New Hampshire
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
was one of the early states to establish
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
a a review board a pesticide review
 
04:52:46.730 --> 04:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
board delegated with a responsibility of
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
regulating pesticides in the state
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
it has the has the expertise and and I I
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
don't know of if director Russo has
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
provided with the rsas but the the RSA
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
establishing the makeup of the board is
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 430 colon 30.
 
04:53:11.448 --> 04:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
and then 430 colon 31 uh is the
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and authority of the
 
04:53:13.798 --> 04:53:15.530 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and authority of the
board

04:53:15.530 --> 04:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:53:18.530 --> 04:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I I can speak Farm Bureau we can
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
speak to the the process we've had an
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
issue with our Growers with relative to
 
04:53:26.690 --> 04:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
sweet corn in the state and bird damage
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's in it's been our some of our growth
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
had quite a Time particularly in the
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state there's a
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's a product on the market it's
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
called avatrol that some of our Growers
 
04:53:38.510 --> 04:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
are aware of and it's it's it can be
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
used around uh for bird control around
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
buildings but there it but the label
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
restricts it to that it's not allowed
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
for use in the field and we have Growers
 
04:53:49.730 --> 04:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
that would like to use it because of it
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
is effective
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
what we did we went to the pesticide
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
control board
 
04:53:57.288 --> 04:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
and brought the issue to them
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
this was if I've got my year right this
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
is before the pandemic uh 20 2019 so we
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
started this process
 
04:54:10.010 --> 04:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
and we still don't have use of it
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
and uh initially there was a there was a
 
04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
meeting we had which involved
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension we invited fish
 
04:54:19.128 --> 04:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
and game we invited a whole group of
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to discuss it so just
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to know where were the
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
concerns what could be done what was the
 
04:54:26.690 --> 04:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
process and all so we had that initial
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
meeting then we went to the pesticide
 
04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
control board
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
they they and again if you'll see the
 
04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
makeup of the boy there's there's
 
04:54:35.448 --> 04:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
expertise there from from various state
 
04:54:39.070 --> 04:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
agency Fish and Game Des HHS
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture licensed
 
04:54:41.760 --> 04:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture licensed
applicator

04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
applicator
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to see some data
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
rightfully so they wanted some data so
 
04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
we applied for some funding through the
 
04:54:52.730 --> 04:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
the IPM fund within the Department of
 
04:54:54.050 --> 04:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
Agriculture with some of the the
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
pesticide fees go towards and we we
 
04:55:02.208 --> 04:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
approached the USDA their uh Wildlife
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
Management folks who can use Avatar
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
legally and and we we set up a couple of
 
04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
of uh study points on farms in the state
 
04:55:13.610 --> 04:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
and then we went we there was report
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we provided to the pesticide
 
04:55:16.610 --> 04:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
control board
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
we all recognized based on it we that we
 
04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
needed more data we went back and we're
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the process of conducting we've now
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
completed we need to submit the report
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
but a second study so what I'm my point
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
in raising this is that that it's
 
04:55:34.970 --> 04:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
thorough and and despite this this
 
04:55:36.770 --> 04:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
whether we're our Growers are going to
 
04:55:38.570 --> 04:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
have to get the use of it that they want
 
04:55:40.850 --> 04:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
we don't know my guess is they'll look
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
at the information and then they'll
 
04:55:46.690 --> 04:55:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
I mean the the idea of a working group
 
04:55:53.448 --> 04:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
is is fine but let the pesticide con
 
04:55:55.368 --> 04:55:55.378 align:start position:0%
control board convene that work and
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
would do it through them they do it
 
04:55:56.638 --> 04:55:58.788 align:start position:0%
would do it through them they do it
anyway

04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:55:58.798 --> 04:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
as as far as as prior to our request for
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
avatrol the question was asked of you
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
know have there been other requests
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
other ideas or other things that could
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
be done our Growers have to demonstrate
 
04:56:13.128 --> 04:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
all the things that they have been doing
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
throughout the process
 
04:56:16.138 --> 04:56:18.948 align:start position:0%
throughout the process
um

04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry man I'm just trying to skip
 
04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
again if I uh the the the board they
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
they meet quarterly but they can meet
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
more often as needed they bring in they
 
04:56:34.368 --> 04:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
bring in the expertise they don't have
 
04:56:37.368 --> 04:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
they're very thorough
 
04:56:39.650 --> 04:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll close with a couple
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
things I guess I want to answer a uh a
 
04:56:45.530 --> 04:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
question that was is regarding and I
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if the it was exactly meant
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
this but what would the impact of
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
passing this bill and for those of you
 
04:56:53.090 --> 04:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
that have been in the legislature a few
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
few years you've heard me say this
 
04:56:56.448 --> 04:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
before when similar bills will come up
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
do you as a legislature really want to
 
04:57:04.368 --> 04:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
be uh taking up every single uh request
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
to ban or allow a pesticide that's going
 
04:57:09.050 --> 04:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
to come your way once you stop down that
 
04:57:09.060 --> 04:57:09.890 align:start position:0%
to come your way once you stop down that
road

04:57:09.890 --> 04:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:57:12.170 --> 04:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
you you and it's all due respect to you
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
you don't have the expertise you have
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
established a board that does that works
 
04:57:17.400 --> 04:57:18.230 align:start position:0%
established a board that does that works
well

04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
into just to give you an idea of another
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
area where that I think is pertinent to
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
this is uh hold uh for many years you as
 
04:57:28.970 --> 04:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature again many years ago uh
 
04:57:30.890 --> 04:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
you regulated hunting seasons up until
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
the mid 1980s believe it or not and it
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
was finally realized when we had some
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
real issues with a wildlife population
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
it was it was a geez we've got this
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
agency fishing game with experts these
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
biologists that that should be doing
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
this in the legislature in its wisdom at
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
the time uh provided them the authority
 
04:57:49.850 --> 04:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
to set seasons and they have been
 
04:57:51.530 --> 04:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
sentenced and they have public hearings
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they take import and such and such
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
so again I would I would urge you uh to
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill and knowing that you
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
have a process in place that will will
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
deal with the issue and I think deal
 
04:58:06.770 --> 04:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
with it relatively well and I'll leave
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
it at that Madam chair thank you thank
 
04:58:11.170 --> 04:58:11.180 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
04:58:13.490 --> 04:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.288 --> 04:58:24.298 align:start position:0%
and you indicated three minutes uh yes
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
ma'am I'm gonna try and stick to it uh
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
feel free to hit me with any questions
 
04:58:32.750 --> 04:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
related to decide this is my life I am a
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabilitator and when someone
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
finds an animal that was poisoned they
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
do not call uh your pesticide people
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
they don't call their doctor if it's
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
their pet they call their veterinarian
 
04:58:49.610 --> 04:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
if it's a wild hawk or a wild fox or any
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
other Predator they call me
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
it is not an emotional thing I come here
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
to you with it is science based that's
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
why I can answer a lot of questions some
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
people who sell this stuff can't answer
 
04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
as far as the amount of poison an animal
 
04:59:08.330 --> 04:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
has to eat for it to bleed out
 
04:59:11.330 --> 04:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
internally they can't tell you because
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
even when we test these animals livers
 
04:59:17.810 --> 04:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh for what was it called uh I think he
 
04:59:22.690 --> 04:59:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
something like a trace it's not Trace
 
04:59:24.780 --> 04:59:25.788 align:start position:0%
something like a trace it's not Trace
okay

04:59:25.788 --> 04:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:27.288 --> 04:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
have you ever been to your doctor and
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
had your kid tested for lead did they
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
tell you you had like a little bit of
 
04:59:30.600 --> 04:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
tell you you had like a little bit of
lead

04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
lead
 
04:59:33.170 --> 04:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
kid just got a little bit of lettuce got
 
04:59:34.730 --> 04:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
a little bit of poison when they test
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
those animals for poison what they do is
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
they take a sample of the animal's liver
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
and they test them and what I can tell
 
04:59:44.090 --> 04:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
you is it's very rare for a bird of prey
 
04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
or a predator species to come back
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
testing positive for just one form of
 
04:59:50.090 --> 04:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
rodenticide poisoning they usually test
 
04:59:52.250 --> 04:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
positive for at least three
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's no way on Earth you guys haven't
 
04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
had animals of prey dying from rat
 
04:59:58.860 --> 04:59:59.628 align:start position:0%
had animals of prey dying from rat
poison

04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
poison
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
I can show you multiple tests I'm just
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
over the Border in Massachusetts asked
 
05:00:08.090 --> 05:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
by many of your constituents to come
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
today because I own a wildlife rescue
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's followed by over a hundred
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
thousand people and this mattered a lot
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people because I posted by a
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
lot of the animals that I've taken care
 
05:00:17.218 --> 05:00:18.948 align:start position:0%
lot of the animals that I've taken care
of

05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:00:18.958 --> 05:00:20.510 align:start position:0%
of
um

05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:23.090 --> 05:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
it can be denied some people will say oh
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
you have an ambulance so it's standard
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
procedure now if you're taking care of a
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
predatory species and you're a wildlife
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator to draw that animal's
 
05:00:30.958 --> 05:00:31.970 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator to draw that animal's
blood

05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
blood
 
05:00:35.090 --> 05:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
rat poison works by
 
05:00:37.368 --> 05:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
depleting the body of vitamin K your
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
body has like 50 things that have to
 
05:00:40.970 --> 05:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
happen in order for your blood to clot
 
05:00:43.010 --> 05:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
if one of those things is removed your
 
05:00:45.530 --> 05:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
blood can't clot clotting is the very
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
beginning process to Healing you can't
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
clot you can't heal that doesn't mean
 
05:00:51.650 --> 05:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
that you okay you're fine unless you get
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
cut your body is healing itself right
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
now in this room you bump into something
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
anything your body is constantly healing
 
05:00:57.420 --> 05:00:58.250 align:start position:0%
anything your body is constantly healing
itself

05:00:58.250 --> 05:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
the body becomes completely depleted of
 
05:01:01.970 --> 05:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
vitamin K
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
I do mainly mammals
 
05:01:06.550 --> 05:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
California's starting a link between
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
boxes with mange and
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and poison because the poison
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
compromises the immune system makes
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
these animals more prone to these things
 
05:01:19.250 --> 05:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of foxes with mange that I get
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
four out of five their blood is not clot
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
normally your average mammal's blood
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
should clot in two to five minutes your
 
05:01:26.690 --> 05:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
average bird of preys five to seven
 
05:01:28.128 --> 05:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
we're talking about animals that can't
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
claw for 20 30 minutes I can tell you
 
05:01:33.610 --> 05:01:33.620 align:start position:0%
that your average Fox bleeds out
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
abdominally your average Board of prey
 
05:01:39.650 --> 05:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
bleeds out peripherally
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
I can tell you this because I've seen so
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
many of them I can tell you this because
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
I work with people who see these animals
 
05:01:49.550 --> 05:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
all the time and I can show you video
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
after video of blood we take from these
 
05:01:57.050 --> 05:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.690 --> 05:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
yes the amount of poison meant to kill
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
one rat is not going to kill a fox it's
 
05:02:03.530 --> 05:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
not going to kill an owl your average
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
great horned owl eats 2 000 rodents
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
every year
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
your pesticide people thought that your
 
05:02:13.250 --> 05:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
bird's a prey species are increasing
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're not you can Google it birds of
 
05:02:19.150 --> 05:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
prayer down significantly globally
 
05:02:23.330 --> 05:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
your rodent population is increasing how
 
05:02:25.250 --> 05:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
if they're using the most effective
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
methods you want to know why because of
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
a bird of prey eats six or seven
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
poisoned rats and it dies
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
that bird would have eaten two thousand
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
that year now it's dead Mother Nature
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
has her way of taking care of these
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.850 --> 05:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
I this is an emotional thing for me and
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm very scientific about a lot of
 
05:02:50.208 --> 05:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
these things I have stood by these
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
necropsies because pesticide companies
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
will tell you just because the animal
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
tested positive its liver doesn't mean
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
it necessarily died from rat poison so
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
I've had to sit by necropsies that prove
 
05:03:03.170 --> 05:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
significant internal hemorrhaging of
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
these animals
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
which basically means they've bled out
 
05:03:07.680 --> 05:03:09.250 align:start position:0%
which basically means they've bled out
internally

05:03:09.250 --> 05:03:09.260 align:start position:0%
internally
 
05:03:11.708 --> 05:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
four-month-old Fox
 
05:03:15.050 --> 05:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
four months old positive for three
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
different types of rat poison bled out
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
internally I took its blood which should
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
have clotted within two to five minutes
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
I went to the veterinarian's office four
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
hours later after it died which was
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
awful to witness by the way that is no
 
05:03:29.208 --> 05:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
easy death
 
05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
is blood never clotted
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
never clotted this animal would have
 
05:03:34.138 --> 05:03:35.150 align:start position:0%
never clotted this animal would have
helped

05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
helped
 
05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
if I were a construction worker and I
 
05:03:39.770 --> 05:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
built you a house that lasted a year I'd
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
go to jail
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
if a pesticide company is coming to your
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
house and giving you stuff it's going to
 
05:03:46.730 --> 05:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
kill the six rats in your house it's
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to kill your neighborhood fox or
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
your neighborhood owl
 
05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
your problem's going to come back it's
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
kind of going to come back way worse
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
and your pesticide people need to be
 
05:03:58.368 --> 05:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
talking to your Wildlife rehabilitators
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
those are volunteers in your community
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
that see this firsthand those are the
 
05:04:05.810 --> 05:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
people who are seeing these animals that
 
05:04:07.490 --> 05:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
are being affected by this and
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely you can see test after test
 
05:04:12.170 --> 05:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
Tufts Wildlife Clinic was studying Birds
 
05:04:14.448 --> 05:04:14.458 align:start position:0%
of Prey they tested every bird that came
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
in hit by car whatever
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
the first few years they tested
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think 70 of them were positive for rat
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
poison this last year they tested every
 
05:04:27.050 --> 05:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
single bird of prey tested positive for
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
rat poison and I can tell you even if it
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
isn't enough to kill them certainly have
 
05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:36.288 --> 05:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:04:41.690 --> 05:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
05:04:43.610 --> 05:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
so these have been around from the 1970s
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
is there any explanation given for why
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
this problem seems so maybe it's always
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
been here and it's just now getting
 
05:04:52.368 --> 05:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
attention or is there a sense that the
 
05:04:54.650 --> 05:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
problem is increasing I think the
 
05:04:56.330 --> 05:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
problem is increasing
 
05:04:59.090 --> 05:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
um Wildlife rehabilitators are newer and
 
05:05:00.530 --> 05:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
so there haven't been a lot of tests
 
05:05:01.970 --> 05:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
like in order to prove it you'd have to
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
test the animal's liver
 
05:05:06.288 --> 05:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
um and in animals that don't die from it
 
05:05:07.550 --> 05:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we're treating as someone was
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
asking about how long do you need to
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
give vitamin K for
 
05:05:10.680 --> 05:05:11.530 align:start position:0%
give vitamin K for
um

05:05:11.530 --> 05:05:11.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know how it's taken this long
 
05:05:17.628 --> 05:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
but I know that California uh has proved
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
that it's affected the the mammals and
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
the birds of prey in Massachusetts is
 
05:05:24.288 --> 05:05:24.298 align:start position:0%
also trying to pass the bill right now
 
05:05:27.530 --> 05:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
um the the vitamin K thing I want to
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
mention is uh it depends on how many
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
animals how bad
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
the poison is in the animal
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
in the animals that we take care of uh
 
05:05:40.010 --> 05:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's six weeks of treatment
 
05:05:42.288 --> 05:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
and I also sorry this thing so many
 
05:05:43.730 --> 05:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
things I want to say
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
um when I when we do knee crops to these
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
animals I don't know if you've ever seen
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
rat poison a lot of it's like lime green
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
their livers are lime green they're
 
05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a dark red
 
05:05:58.610 --> 05:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
um it's their kidneys it's awful and I
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
would love to show anyone who works for
 
05:06:01.970 --> 05:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
a pesticide company pictures and
 
05:06:04.490 --> 05:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
documentation of all these things
 
05:06:04.500 --> 05:06:06.050 align:start position:0%
documentation of all these things
sorry

05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:06:08.570 --> 05:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
05:06:10.128 --> 05:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much for your
 
05:06:10.138 --> 05:06:11.150 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much for your
testimony

05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:06:14.090 --> 05:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
um sorry would you support the creation
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
we've had the uh the Audubon uh New
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon recommend the creation
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
of working group which would include
 
05:06:23.448 --> 05:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
licensed New Hampshire wildlife
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators would you support the
 
05:06:27.650 --> 05:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
creation of a group like that because
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things we certainly
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
need to do is to be able to accurately
 
05:06:34.368 --> 05:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
quantify the the problems so absolutely
 
05:06:36.170 --> 05:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
supportive working group like that there
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
must be a disconnect for for this the
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
information that I've heard
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
um there has to be disconnected I think
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
we have to get these people talking to
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
each other absolutely
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:50.050 --> 05:06:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.330 --> 05:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
sorry oh my gosh I just went I'm sorry
 
05:06:54.770 --> 05:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:06:58.730 --> 05:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
um so when in when uh when a rat or a
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
mouse ingests
 
05:07:03.050 --> 05:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
um any of these
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
second generation
 
05:07:07.128 --> 05:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's the black box right and
 
05:07:10.490 --> 05:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
the mouse goes in and takes a piece
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
I thought what happens is they have to
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
go find water correct isn't that what
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
has to happen they die rat go try to
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
find water after they eat that they can
 
05:07:21.770 --> 05:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
digest it from where it is and it's not
 
05:07:23.208 --> 05:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
just rats and mice to get into it it's
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
Chipmunks that you gourd themselves and
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
you can see the actual hemorrhaging in
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
their cheeks when you find check monk
 
05:07:31.128 --> 05:07:31.138 align:start position:0%
that's had it and they can tell you how
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
much it takes to kill one rat that
 
05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop a rat from gorging because
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to go through the GI
 
05:07:37.368 --> 05:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
tract which takes you know after it's
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
digested then it can start making their
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
blood have difficulty clotting but they
 
05:07:42.110 --> 05:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
may have ingested far more than they
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
needed to to die
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and they're just running around and
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
they're running and the thing is
 
05:07:48.288 --> 05:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
compromise pray predator species are
 
05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
taught to look for compromised prey and
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
when an animal's slowly Bleeding Out
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
believe me that rat's gonna walk a lot
 
05:07:55.010 --> 05:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
slower than another rat that's healthy
 
05:07:57.170 --> 05:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
so that's how they're able to pick these
 
05:07:58.850 --> 05:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
guys up they're they're going after them
 
05:08:00.890 --> 05:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
because they're walking slower and
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're compromise they're slowly
 
05:08:04.610 --> 05:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
bleeding out obviously I I highly
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
suggest uh snap traps I'm not opposed to
 
05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
killing rats I understand that they
 
05:08:11.208 --> 05:08:11.218 align:start position:0%
cause a huge health risk
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and and we've suggested to people use
 
05:08:16.128 --> 05:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
snap traps take that dead rat or dead
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
mouse and throw it in the back of your
 
05:08:19.490 --> 05:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
yard let all the predator species know
 
05:08:22.250 --> 05:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
here's the place to go to to dine you
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
yes so uh we heard from the Department
 
05:08:39.708 --> 05:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
that they had not had reports of uh
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
animal of animals that had
 
05:08:42.120 --> 05:08:42.770 align:start position:0%
animal of animals that had
um

05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
have been shown to have died from uh
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
from ingestion and I'm wondering if you
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you submit rep when you run across
 
05:08:55.010 --> 05:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
these animals do you submit reports to
 
05:08:57.650 --> 05:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
government agencies uh as a matter of
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
course to make sure it's documented
 
05:09:01.550 --> 05:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
there's no testing right now it's
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
something we're trying to work with our
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
state on too there's there's no way of
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
tracking this now I do have tests and I
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
know there's no way that the rehabbers
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
in this state don't have tests too
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um it can be argued he said that they
 
05:09:16.128 --> 05:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
tested a lot of animals that were hunted
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
that tested positive for rat poison but
 
05:09:20.810 --> 05:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
without a veterinarian doing a necropsy
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
and confirming that there was actual
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging it can be argued the animal
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't die from it but there's no
 
05:09:28.368 --> 05:09:28.378 align:start position:0%
arguing that it was exposed the problem
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
is also financially cost me four hundred
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
dollars to have a fox and we don't get
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
paid to do this uh 400 have a fox knee
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
crop seat and test it it was that four
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
month old Fox and it broke my heart and
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't care I spent the money because
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
people will argue that's not what it was
 
05:09:44.330 --> 05:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
and defend actively after the vet opened
 
05:09:46.490 --> 05:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
that animal up and tested the liver it
 
05:09:48.110 --> 05:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
could not be argued that's four hundred
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
dollars one fox and we're all volunteers
 
05:09:52.850 --> 05:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
for the State uh I think it would be
 
05:09:55.070 --> 05:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
good if all the states made more efforts
 
05:09:56.690 --> 05:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
to do things like that and again like I
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
said if we're using rat poison and the
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
rat population is getting worse it
 
05:10:00.890 --> 05:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
stands to reason that we're killing the
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
birds of prey who are actually helping
 
05:10:02.760 --> 05:10:07.510 align:start position:0%
birds of prey who are actually helping
us

05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
could I have a follow-up
 
05:10:10.680 --> 05:10:12.830 align:start position:0%
could I have a follow-up
um

05:10:12.830 --> 05:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.930 --> 05:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
would it um
 
05:10:17.690 --> 05:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
if there are I I recognize you're in
 
05:10:19.010 --> 05:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that you know we're
 
05:10:20.330 --> 05:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with the New Hampshire law here
 
05:10:22.490 --> 05:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm you you have colleagues in New
 
05:10:25.730 --> 05:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that uh I'm wondering if there
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
were if it would make sense to have some
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a standard reporting procedure
 
05:10:32.770 --> 05:10:32.780 align:start position:0%
for when repel
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators get animals in that are
 
05:10:38.510 --> 05:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
showing signs or you know or showing
 
05:10:40.610 --> 05:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
clear evidence of poisoning I think
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
another difficult thing too is some of
 
05:10:43.368 --> 05:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
them we can save like they were
 
05:10:45.410 --> 05:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
mentioning Vitamin K is one way that we
 
05:10:47.448 --> 05:10:47.458 align:start position:0%
can save them and when you've had an
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
animal that you're sure has rat poison
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
because it's bleeding out and you give
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
vitamin K and it survives I can't then
 
05:10:56.510 --> 05:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
test its liver and prove it what I can
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
tell you is the vitamin K meds blood
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
clot normal again so it stands to reason
 
05:11:02.090 --> 05:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
but one could argue the only ones that
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
we could actually prove it with there
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
are the ones that die
 
05:11:07.550 --> 05:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
um but yes if if the state worked with
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
Wildlife rehabilitators more that would
 
05:11:11.208 --> 05:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
be helpful uh I know Wildlife we're here
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
with rehabilitators were asked to come
 
05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
here and nobody wanted to stand front of
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
everybody and talk about it which makes
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
it difficult but I think that um I
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
certainly anytime someone wants to come
 
05:11:27.288 --> 05:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
to you know I understand that I'm I'm
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
right across the border I'm in
 
05:11:30.288 --> 05:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but we're difficult and
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
all those things that are listed are the
 
05:11:34.850 --> 05:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
things that all the owls and the foxes
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
are testing positive for they affect
 
05:11:37.260 --> 05:11:38.330 align:start position:0%
are testing positive for they affect
mammals

05:11:38.330 --> 05:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
mammals
 
05:11:39.890 --> 05:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
whether you're in New Hampshire or
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or the other side of the
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
world the same way a follow-up
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
so uh is it uh is it possible to get can
 
05:11:53.930 --> 05:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
you can you uh detect the poisoning from
 
05:11:55.850 --> 05:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
a blood sample or do you need in order
 
05:11:57.650 --> 05:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
to confirm it you need to have a liver
 
05:12:00.050 --> 05:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
sample you would need to confirm that it
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
was poison you would need a liver sample
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
you can confirm that the blood isn't
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
clotting properly but you can't confirm
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
why if it's poison it all uh stays in
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
the liver okay thank you you're welcome
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:23.050 --> 05:12:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
excuse me if you'd like to testify later
 
05:12:31.910 --> 05:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I do have a question I'd
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
like to I'm interested to know you as a
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabber how many
 
05:12:43.128 --> 05:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
Predator animals do you see say in a
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
month's time
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
that have this issue
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's mainly the adults that I see that
 
05:12:52.128 --> 05:12:52.138 align:start position:0%
would have this issue it's probably more
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the winter because in the spring we
 
05:12:57.650 --> 05:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
have the babies I received six foxes
 
05:13:00.170 --> 05:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
this year four of which
 
05:13:00.180 --> 05:13:01.690 align:start position:0%
this year four of which
were

05:13:01.690 --> 05:13:01.700 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
so one I was able to save so I can't
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
confirm I can tell you that vitamin K
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
made its blood clot normally again but I
 
05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
can't tell you scientifically without a
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
sample of his liver but three of them uh
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
were positive for rat poison and I can
 
05:13:17.810 --> 05:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
05:13:17.820 --> 05:13:18.430 align:start position:0%
tell you that
um

05:13:18.430 --> 05:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:22.250 --> 05:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
the we work with uh call
 
05:13:22.260 --> 05:13:22.910 align:start position:0%
the we work with uh call
um

05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
Cape Ann wildlife and I have all of
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
theirs that we probably have 11 positive
 
05:13:31.128 --> 05:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
um owls
 
05:13:34.250 --> 05:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
for rat poison uh the same poisons that
 
05:13:37.368 --> 05:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
were in that the S they're all asgars
 
05:13:37.378 --> 05:13:38.990 align:start position:0%
were in that the S they're all asgars
um

05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
we don't those 11 is that in a year yes
 
05:13:45.170 --> 05:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
okay probably more to be honest with you
 
05:13:46.970 --> 05:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
some of them they were able to save so I
 
05:13:49.970 --> 05:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
can't prove definitively to you
 
05:13:52.368 --> 05:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
um but I I can certainly send the board
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
all all those positive tests
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with and the findings
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with these animals Blood Out
 
05:14:03.050 --> 05:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh their bodies just one big bruise with
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
birds their bodies one big bruise it's
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
easy to tell you just put the feathers
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
aside and it's just black and blue with
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh with a fox or a mammal it's more
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
abdominal hemorrhaging so you can't look
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
at them as much they need to be more cut
 
05:14:19.850 --> 05:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
open to see thank you any other
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:14:23.690 --> 05:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon thank you I'd
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
sorry about that Madam chair and the
 
05:14:52.730 --> 05:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Adam
 
05:14:54.530 --> 05:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
Karachi and I'm a second generation
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
owner of my family business pestend
 
05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
which is located in Plaistow New
 
05:15:00.890 --> 05:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we currently service most of
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
New England including New Hampshire for
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
general pest control wildlife and of
 
05:15:06.650 --> 05:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
course rodents we've been in business
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
since 1977 and currently have 85
 
05:15:11.570 --> 05:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
employees and I'm here today to explain
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
why we are against HB 326
 
05:15:17.810 --> 05:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
rodents are something that people do not
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
want to think about especially when it
 
05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the health and safety of their
 
05:15:23.090 --> 05:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
family unfortunately it is a fact of
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
life that rodents pose major concerns to
 
05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
our food supply well I'm not ha well I'm
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
happy to see that there is some
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment to this due to the
 
05:15:32.690 --> 05:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
exceptions list the problem does not
 
05:15:34.970 --> 05:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
stop at those type of locations
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
the problem is that these look uh I'm
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
sorry the problem is the locations that
 
05:15:40.730 --> 05:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
are not included on the exceptions list
 
05:15:43.310 --> 05:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
a major concern is the expense that
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
comes along with the Banning of the
 
05:15:46.490 --> 05:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
second generation anticoagulant
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
rodenticides landlords and small
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
business owners especially restaurant
 
05:15:53.208 --> 05:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
owners are already feeling the pain of
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
the finances in our current economic
 
05:15:57.708 --> 05:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
climate restaurant owners are finally
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
starting to recover from coveted
 
05:16:01.610 --> 05:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and then got hit with major
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
inflation costs if this bill is to pass
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to take a service that
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
maybe is 100 a month for them and turn
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
it into 100 a week because we're going
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
to have to go back to check those snap
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
traps and check everything on a more
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
frequent basis this is going to lead to
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
them trying to do it on their own and I
 
05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
know as David Rousseau was talking about
 
05:16:23.208 --> 05:16:23.218 align:start position:0%
we want to try and restrict these
 
05:16:25.128 --> 05:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
as you all know if you want to find
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
something you will find it you can get
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
what you want whether it's on the
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
internet going across state lines
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
ordering it from wherever you want to to
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
be able to do it on your own
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's when they're not going to follow
 
05:16:39.170 --> 05:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
the labels that's when there will be
 
05:16:41.930 --> 05:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
label violations and that's when bigger
 
05:16:44.208 --> 05:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
issues will come about
 
05:16:46.330 --> 05:16:46.340 align:start position:0%
the bigger impact to me
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon brought up that
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a tourist playground I
 
05:16:52.610 --> 05:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
completely agree with that between
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
skiing and lakes and beaches and leaf
 
05:16:55.680 --> 05:16:56.690 align:start position:0%
skiing and lakes and beaches and leaf
peeping

05:16:56.690 --> 05:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
peeping
 
05:16:59.090 --> 05:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
people come to New Hampshire because it
 
05:17:00.890 --> 05:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
is a great place to vacation and to
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
travel to
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to have happen is the
 
05:17:06.890 --> 05:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
negative press that Massachusetts New
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
York are already seeing due to rodent
 
05:17:09.000 --> 05:17:10.310 align:start position:0%
York are already seeing due to rodent
populations

05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
populations
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
one bad review because they were at a
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
hotel or a restaurant and a mouse ran
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
across can an area
 
05:17:19.610 --> 05:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
we've seen it happen before I know of
 
05:17:21.530 --> 05:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
restaurants myself that have been shut
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
down and gone out of business because
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
rodents ran by while someone was eating
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from a personal
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
experience that I've had we service a
 
05:17:33.410 --> 05:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
local butcher shop
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have been dealing with mice
 
05:17:38.448 --> 05:17:38.458 align:start position:0%
for five to seven years
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's generations of mice that are
 
05:17:42.970 --> 05:17:42.980 align:start position:0%
living within the store
 
05:17:45.530 --> 05:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
05:17:47.448 --> 05:17:47.458 align:start position:0%
these mice don't leave
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
that store
 
05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've pulled out in the last year 250
 
05:17:54.890 --> 05:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
rodents from this store
 
05:17:56.930 --> 05:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're using just about every tactic that
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
snap traps are not always the best
 
05:18:00.240 --> 05:18:01.310 align:start position:0%
snap traps are not always the best
option

05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:18:04.250 --> 05:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
in a mouse and rat colony especially a
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
rat colony there's an alpha male
 
05:18:08.330 --> 05:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you about an alpha male
 
05:18:11.208 --> 05:18:11.218 align:start position:0%
it's lived for a long time it's very
 
05:18:14.570 --> 05:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
smart there's videos of alpha male rats
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking their tail and hitting a snap
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
trap to set it off so it can go and get
 
05:18:19.610 --> 05:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
the bait
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
it will not get caught in these traps
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon mentioned that she
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
even had
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
traps within her home
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
and this is something that we need to be
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
very aware of we need you can't remove a
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
tool from our toolbox Banning something
 
05:18:37.070 --> 05:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're never going to get it back and
 
05:18:39.770 --> 05:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
while we've continued to have
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
this growth in the rodent population
 
05:18:45.530 --> 05:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
yes there's a lot of reasons for that
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
covid was a huge one we had all of these
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
rodents that were used to feeding at
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
their typical sites such as a restaurant
 
05:18:56.090 --> 05:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
now I had to find out find food
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
elsewhere that's why they're starting to
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
end up at homes and in places where we
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them before
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
a mouse can fit into a hole the size of
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
a dime
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
so exclusion work sure it can be done
 
05:19:09.890 --> 05:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
nothing is perfect
 
05:19:12.650 --> 05:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
also with exclusion Mark you go from a
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
300 job to a three thousand dollar job
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these food
 
05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
plants and the stuff that or the places
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
that are on the exceptions list they
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
have the resources and the funds to pay
 
05:19:26.330 --> 05:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
for these extra services
 
05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about low income
 
05:19:30.530 --> 05:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
they can't pay three thousand dollars
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
so are they supposed to live with
 
05:19:35.448 --> 05:19:35.458 align:start position:0%
rodents are they supposed to have mice
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
running around their their home
 
05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
no so instead they're gonna go and buy
 
05:19:42.650 --> 05:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
it on their own and again now we get two
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
professionals not being involved and
 
05:19:49.250 --> 05:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
the last one I have is we had a house
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
where there was an elderly couple
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
they had no kids
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
their house was infested with rats
 
05:20:01.970 --> 05:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
they only the only reason that got
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention was the
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors were complaining because the
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
rats were running all around the yard
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
and we finally got in there
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
they had over 150 rats that we pulled
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
out from this house that these people
 
05:20:13.970 --> 05:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
were living with
 
05:20:17.208 --> 05:20:17.218 align:start position:0%
the respiratory issues were unbelievable
 
05:20:20.570 --> 05:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
they had major health side effects due
 
05:20:22.010 --> 05:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
to the rats that were inside of this
 
05:20:22.020 --> 05:20:22.970 align:start position:0%
to the rats that were inside of this
house

05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
we started with snap traps and we got
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
the majority of them with snap traps but
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah at the end we had to use bait to
 
05:20:32.810 --> 05:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
finish them off
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
the single feeding is what can make the
 
05:20:38.750 --> 05:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
difference because if you have a rodent
 
05:20:40.368 --> 05:20:40.378 align:start position:0%
population going back to that butcher
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
shop the rodents there loved feeding on
 
05:20:44.690 --> 05:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
the the meat and the delicious food
 
05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
that's there
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
so they might go and feed on the bait
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
once and then not touch it for weeks
 
05:20:52.368 --> 05:20:52.378 align:start position:0%
because they have other food sources
 
05:20:53.570 --> 05:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't help if you're talking
 
05:20:55.490 --> 05:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
about first generation
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
that's where the second generation comes
 
05:20:58.490 --> 05:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
in because you want to knock this
 
05:21:00.170 --> 05:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
population out
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
so in closing I in no way shape or form
 
05:21:05.930 --> 05:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
think that there isn't a concern there's
 
05:21:07.550 --> 05:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
obviously a concern and that has been
 
05:21:10.610 --> 05:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
talked about Nationwide and there's a
 
05:21:11.690 --> 05:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
lot of people looking at it they've
 
05:21:13.610 --> 05:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
brought up the EPA is even dealing with
 
05:21:13.620 --> 05:21:14.330 align:start position:0%
brought up the EPA is even dealing with
it

05:21:14.330 --> 05:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:21:16.550 --> 05:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
but we need to make decisions based off
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
of facts and Science and not off of what
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
we think might be happening
 
05:21:24.650 --> 05:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:21:28.850 --> 05:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
05:21:31.970 --> 05:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:21:31.980 --> 05:21:33.288 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
um

05:21:33.288 --> 05:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:35.570 --> 05:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
I guess this just occurred to me in the
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
sense that I do know that the department
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
has come before our committee and talked
 
05:21:41.690 --> 05:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
significantly before about IPM programs
 
05:21:44.090 --> 05:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
and training requirements licensure
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
requirements and because this is a
 
05:21:45.958 --> 05:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
requirements and because this is a
non-restricted

05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
non-restricted
 
05:21:48.360 --> 05:21:50.750 align:start position:0%
non-restricted
chemical

05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
does that mean that somebody like
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
yourself is not necessarily tested on
 
05:21:58.010 --> 05:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
the application of that no so it's it's
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
different with us because we're
 
05:22:00.770 --> 05:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
commercial for hire so if you're
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
commercial for hire you do have to be
 
05:22:02.160 --> 05:22:03.230 align:start position:0%
commercial for hire you do have to be
licensed

05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so everyone in in our company and
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
should be in every company has licensing
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
continuing continuing education courses
 
05:22:10.970 --> 05:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
and credits that they have to have
 
05:22:12.890 --> 05:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
license renewals
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
um so there is testing that you
 
05:22:16.970 --> 05:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
initially have to take and then those
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
courses to to keep up your credits thank
 
05:22:19.920 --> 05:22:20.810 align:start position:0%
courses to to keep up your credits thank
you

05:22:20.810 --> 05:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:22:23.810 --> 05:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so it was mentioned
 
05:22:26.930 --> 05:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
that um the escars are not currently uh
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
restricted use pesticides do you think
 
05:22:31.010 --> 05:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
that making them restricted use
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
pesticides might reduce the amount of
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
um uh uh off well off label use that
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
might be happening from uh from non-red
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
from non-licensed people
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
I do as much as I don't like further
 
05:22:49.730 --> 05:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
regulation if I'm being brutally honest
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think the biggest problem here is a
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
lot of consumer use as opposed to
 
05:22:56.990 --> 05:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
professional use the typically when when
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
we see things we walk into a house and a
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
homeowner has found something we've seen
 
05:23:04.250 --> 05:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
just plates of bait put out that's not a
 
05:23:06.170 --> 05:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
professional putting that out um from
 
05:23:08.208 --> 05:23:08.218 align:start position:0%
what I've seen so I do think it would
 
05:23:08.218 --> 05:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
what I've seen so I do think it would
help

05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:23:13.128 --> 05:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
follow up yes good yeah and what's what
 
05:23:16.490 --> 05:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
sort of procedures do you use to or is
 
05:23:18.530 --> 05:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
there a procedure you can use in order
 
05:23:18.540 --> 05:23:19.788 align:start position:0%
there a procedure you can use in order
to

05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:23:22.970 --> 05:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
um reduce the likelihood that the
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
animals that are that receive the bait
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
are then uh out in the environment where
 
05:23:31.970 --> 05:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
they can be eaten by owls and foxes and
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
Etc so again we follow the label so our
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
placement of our our traps our bait
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
stations which are tamper resistant
 
05:23:42.050 --> 05:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're locked so they do go through a
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
process to make sure just no one can go
 
05:23:46.850 --> 05:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
and open them once the rodents feed off
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the bait they tend to feel sick
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
because again they're bleeding out
 
05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening they don't go
 
05:23:55.070 --> 05:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
for water to enter a previous statement
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
that was said mice don't even need water
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
they get it from their food but
 
05:24:00.410 --> 05:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
typically they go back to their nesting
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
they don't feel good when you don't feel
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
good where do you go back to your bed
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
um so what we've seen is that's what
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
typically is happening but to say that
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
you know it's a wild animal there's no
 
05:24:13.368 --> 05:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
way for me to tell it don't go into the
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
yard you have to go over this way
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your your testimony
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
today uh so I'll ask you the same
 
05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
question I asked uh our Wildlife
 
05:24:30.890 --> 05:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator uh uh witness uh would you
 
05:24:32.810 --> 05:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
be supportive of the type of working
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
group that the uh that New Hampshire
 
05:24:37.970 --> 05:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
Audubon has uh proposed which would
 
05:24:40.128 --> 05:24:40.138 align:start position:0%
include not only a wildlife
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator but also licensed
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
pesticide applicators I wouldn't be
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
against it again I do believe that the
 
05:24:48.170 --> 05:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
pesticide board does have a process
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and I I've been a part of
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittees where they do bring in
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
other people
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not opposed to it but I would
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the pesticide board and
 
05:25:00.170 --> 05:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
what they believe is the best option
 
05:25:02.570 --> 05:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you
 
05:25:12.110 --> 05:25:12.120 align:start position:0%

an organization known as talking birds
 
05:26:01.730 --> 05:26:01.740 align:start position:0%

05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
via the use of rodenticides
 
05:26:40.970 --> 05:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
rodents such as mice and rats are a
 
05:26:42.410 --> 05:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
staple for these Raptors and when a
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
rodent after feeding from a poison bait
 
05:26:46.970 --> 05:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
trap makes its way back outside for
 
05:26:48.650 --> 05:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
water and I do disagree with the
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
previous statement they do look for
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
water because they're bleeding out and
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
they need rehydration
 
05:26:57.170 --> 05:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
um they make its way out for water they
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
fall prey to a hawk or an owl and in
 
05:27:02.510 --> 05:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
turn this poison uh these highly
 
05:27:05.090 --> 05:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
beneficial predators
 
05:27:07.128 --> 05:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
it should be noted in this regard that
 
05:27:09.230 --> 05:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
over half of raptor species worldwide
 
05:27:11.810 --> 05:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
are currently in Decline

unconscionable effects on numerous

Raptor species and it's no small point
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
that these birds die a horrifically

05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%

are being poisoned in New Hampshire was
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
reflected in the recent September

Wildlife Journal regarding people a
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
survey by the EPA found that at least 25
 
05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
000 children under the under the age of
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
six ingested enough rodenticides to
 
05:28:55.610 --> 05:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
suffer poisoning symptoms in past years
 
05:28:58.730 --> 05:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
and currently about 15 000 calls per
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
year come into the CDC from parents
 
05:29:04.250 --> 05:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
whose children have eaten rodenticides
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
indeed if even if one places bait where
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
children can't get into it rodents are
 
05:29:11.090 --> 05:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
after distribute it around one's house
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
and property there's really no set no
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%

rodents by their nature they're required
 
05:29:26.270 --> 05:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
to chew they will chew through these Bay

anticoagulant rodenticides which are

listed in House Bill 326. these
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
particular rodenticides are the ones
 
05:29:41.690 --> 05:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
showing up in the vast majorities of
 
05:29:44.448 --> 05:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
raptor necropsies and in the viscer of
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%

05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
Welfare rodents will never be eliminated
 
05:30:18.410 --> 05:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
we've known this since I think 1542 or
 
05:30:20.990 --> 05:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
thereabouts with a bubonic plague
 
05:30:23.990 --> 05:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
oh can only control them many residents
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
and other visitors take much pleasure in
 
05:30:27.288 --> 05:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
the viewing of these birds and in so
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
doing contribute to the economy should
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
it should no further Raptor casualties
 
05:30:34.128 --> 05:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
occur do the element due to the
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
elimination of rodenticides from their
 
05:30:37.970 --> 05:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
environment via adoption of more
 
05:30:40.368 --> 05:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
stringent controls on escars the

likelihood of their survival for
 
05:30:44.270 --> 05:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
generations to come to cherish and enjoy
 
05:30:46.368 --> 05:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
as far better guaranteed
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are far safer and equally
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
effective ways to combat rodents from
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
house cats to ultrasonic repellers to
 
05:30:55.250 --> 05:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide pellets pellets to fully
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
automated traps and self-contained that
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
are self-contained and self-clear every
 
05:31:03.170 --> 05:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
after every instantaneous kill among
 
05:31:05.208 --> 05:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
many others but the most important thing
 
05:31:07.010 --> 05:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
people can do is eliminate their food
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
source if you have rats infestation they
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
are getting food from somewhere you need
 
05:31:14.448 --> 05:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
to keep that food from them by putting
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
it into road and proof containers taking
 
05:31:19.310 --> 05:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
care of your garbage your trash is the
 
05:31:21.050 --> 05:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
most important thing dumpsters for
 
05:31:21.060 --> 05:31:22.730 align:start position:0%
most important thing dumpsters for
example

05:31:22.730 --> 05:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:31:22.740 --> 05:31:23.810 align:start position:0%
example
um

05:31:23.810 --> 05:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
well that's why I'm here today voicing
 
05:31:27.650 --> 05:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
my support of New Hampshire house bill
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
326 as if passed it will go a long way
 
05:31:31.868 --> 05:31:31.878 align:start position:0%
towards ensuring that our children
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and Beyond will still be
 
05:31:35.930 --> 05:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
able to experience the beauty power and
 
05:31:37.788 --> 05:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
Grace of these magnificent magnificent
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
birds and mammals thank you
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.170 --> 05:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
I actually have a question
 
05:31:50.090 --> 05:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I have chickens
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I have put chicken feed out for them
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
to eat which
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
can attract rats rodents and I've had in
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
the past problems with rats and rodents
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
coming into my chicken coop and having a
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
good time eating whatever
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you suggest
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
eliminating that food supply because if
 
05:32:16.010 --> 05:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
I did that my chickens wouldn't be able
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
to have access to food
 
05:32:20.030 --> 05:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
I I guess you could maybe control
 
05:32:22.690 --> 05:32:22.700 align:start position:0%
whether where their food stuff is being
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
made available to them to eat it but I
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
also would suggest that you could apply
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
certain automatic trap measure
 
05:32:31.970 --> 05:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
measurements measures outside of the
 
05:32:33.770 --> 05:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
chicken coop where the rats may be
 
05:32:35.810 --> 05:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
entering there there's one trap called
 
05:32:39.288 --> 05:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
the uh the good nature Auto traps a20
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
model 824 and it's self-bait self sets
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
and self-clears and you could place this
 
05:32:47.930 --> 05:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
Outside The Coop and hopefully the rats
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
might find that that bait more more
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
desirable than what's in the chicken
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
coops that's one suggestion
 
05:32:54.718 --> 05:32:56.628 align:start position:0%
coops that's one suggestion
um

05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:58.490 --> 05:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of other other ones just I
 
05:33:00.410 --> 05:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
guess I could look into that but
 
05:33:02.570 --> 05:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you well you know the the other
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing is that rats are very neophobic
 
05:33:07.970 --> 05:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
which means that they don't they don't
 
05:33:09.730 --> 05:33:09.740 align:start position:0%
like to do anything new
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
and to put any kind of
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
apparatus like that it doesn't seem like
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
that would be as attractive to them as
 
05:33:21.948 --> 05:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
as going to say what you're saying is
 
05:33:23.810 --> 05:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
very true I mean even people with bird
 
05:33:25.610 --> 05:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
feeders I mean bird feeder in the yard
 
05:33:26.690 --> 05:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
and of course of course the birds
 
05:33:28.550 --> 05:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
scatter the food from the feeder falls
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the ground it will attract rodeness
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that yeah I'm
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
not sure what the answer is okay well
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your your
 
05:33:37.128 --> 05:33:37.138 align:start position:0%
testimony today anybody else have
 
05:33:37.138 --> 05:33:38.930 align:start position:0%
testimony today anybody else have
questions

05:33:38.930 --> 05:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:45.050 --> 05:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Daniel Brady
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh mcminnie my
 
05:34:03.170 --> 05:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
name is Daniel Brady I'm the co-owner
 
05:34:04.730 --> 05:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
with my brother of Anchor Pest Services
 
05:34:06.410 --> 05:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're located in Manchester New
 
05:34:08.570 --> 05:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we service from the Lakes
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
Region down to the Seacoast over to
 
05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the border so most most of the
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
population of the state
 
05:34:19.010 --> 05:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to avoid some of the topics
 
05:34:20.448 --> 05:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
just because we're not repeating them Ad
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
nauseam but
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
um our main clientele is residential we
 
05:34:28.010 --> 05:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
don't we stay away from the food
 
05:34:29.570 --> 05:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
factories we stay away from these we
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
focus them only mainly on the home our
 
05:34:35.150 --> 05:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
charge as a pest control operator
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state is to protect the
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of the individual
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
and the environment we take that
 
05:34:41.400 --> 05:34:42.430 align:start position:0%
and the environment we take that
seriously

05:34:42.430 --> 05:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
05:34:45.050 --> 05:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
we have weekly training where we review
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
best practices as well as label and
 
05:34:51.650 --> 05:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
compliance we we have regular spot
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
checks on the technicians out in the
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
field to make sure that they're applying
 
05:34:56.690 --> 05:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
we have quality control checks at random
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
with our clients to make sure that the
 
05:35:03.410 --> 05:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
the stations are up up kept and in good
 
05:35:05.810 --> 05:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
placement obviously it does take a
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
measure of IPM where you're controlling
 
05:35:08.930 --> 05:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
the environment with non-pesticide
 
05:35:13.368 --> 05:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
application methods we for instance if
 
05:35:14.570 --> 05:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
you're on there and you notice that
 
05:35:17.208 --> 05:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
there's a bird of prey Nest we don't
 
05:35:19.550 --> 05:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
apply pesticides there or especially
 
05:35:22.128 --> 05:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
rodenticides you you move it to other
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
locations because frankly they're
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
already doing to her point they're
 
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
already doing some of the control for us
 
05:35:29.930 --> 05:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
so we do work in tandem with with
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
environmental factors that being said
 
05:35:32.400 --> 05:35:33.250 align:start position:0%
environmental factors that being said
though

05:35:33.250 --> 05:35:33.260 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:35:35.570 --> 05:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
some factors are not controllable a
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
single pair of rats can have over 1250
 
05:35:40.788 --> 05:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
descendants in a year that's that's not
 
05:35:43.128 --> 05:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
sustainable with snaps
 
05:35:45.170 --> 05:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
um we have implemented and deployed the
 
05:35:47.690 --> 05:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
good nature the a24 traps and they're
 
05:35:50.810 --> 05:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
really cool not super effective
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
um because it
 
05:35:54.830 --> 05:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
it has to be constantly reset you only
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
get 99 shots out of a cartridge before
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
it has to be replaced the bait may not
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
be palatable to them in whatever you
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
choose there's just a lot of
 
05:36:08.330 --> 05:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
barriers and if you use those types of
 
05:36:10.850 --> 05:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
products then it's if it doesn't work
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
you're out of luck same thing with the
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
snap traps we've employed those because
 
05:36:17.330 --> 05:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
people like when we can take the problem
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
with us
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
um the problem is is just their rapid
 
05:36:25.250 --> 05:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
reproductive rates and some of the other
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
issues that we've found especially with
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
exclusion work is preferred I'd rather
 
05:36:31.610 --> 05:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
prevent a problem than try to solve a
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
problem absolutely and our clients would
 
05:36:34.970 --> 05:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
we do that as well
 
05:36:37.250 --> 05:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
what we found this morning I was
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to our technicians during our
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
regular weekly training meeting
 
05:36:43.610 --> 05:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I asked hey how many of you have
 
05:36:45.530 --> 05:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
crawled under a mobile home or
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured home this past month
 
05:36:50.570 --> 05:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
um all of them had raised their hand and
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
all of them reported rats we have in
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
since October
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
um of just rat and mouse so rodent only
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
new calls we've had 131 new calls for
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
rodents only not including our general
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
calls that we're getting in addition of
 
05:37:10.128 --> 05:37:10.138 align:start position:0%
those 27 have been in the higher popular
 
05:37:12.590 --> 05:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
downtown of Manchester in the high
 
05:37:14.750 --> 05:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
density housing you're going to get 11
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
of them in Nashua in the same population
 
05:37:20.090 --> 05:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
centers and then spread out throughout
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Dover Rochester each of those
 
05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
about five or six a piece and then
 
05:37:28.250 --> 05:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
sporadically throughout the rest of the
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
state and that is just since October
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
that we've had like I said that over 131
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
calls in addition and those are just the
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
ones we track that are specifically for
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
rodents not the general pest control
 
05:37:43.070 --> 05:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
control calls that include our rodent
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
treatments so it is a prolific problem
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
if we and again as I go back to those
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
trailer homes or mobile homes or
 
05:37:53.208 --> 05:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes
 
05:37:55.730 --> 05:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
rats will chew through the floor they'll
 
05:37:58.010 --> 05:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
chew through the wall we've seen it you
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
cannot exclude that it's physically
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
impossible to prevent that through other
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
methods you have to kill the rats and so
 
05:38:08.810 --> 05:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
yes we can trap it
 
05:38:11.690 --> 05:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
but it's prohibitively expensive they
 
05:38:15.110 --> 05:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
cannot afford more often than not the
 
05:38:15.120 --> 05:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
cannot afford more often than not the
additional

05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
visits that it would require to set that
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
many especially when you consider like I
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
said up to 1200 per food and
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
environmental factors up to 1200
 
05:38:28.550 --> 05:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
descendants per pair that it's just a
 
05:38:28.560 --> 05:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
descendants per pair that it's just a
hurricane

05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
hurricane
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
task to try to overcome that with just
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
snaps alone and especially the
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
underserved and our lower income
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
clientele they just wouldn't be able to
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
afford the required trip visits so for
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
that and because there is a responsible
 
05:38:47.690 --> 05:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
use there is a methodology and practice
 
05:38:49.490 --> 05:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
in place that we support and we do
 
05:38:52.128 --> 05:38:52.138 align:start position:0%
adhere to the the department of AGS and
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
Department of pesticides um
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and Licensing we
 
05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
definitely oppose this bill and support
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
the existing organization as it is
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
05:39:07.850 --> 05:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
questions representative germanna thank
 
05:39:09.410 --> 05:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for your
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
testimony uh so I I think it's clear
 
05:39:13.970 --> 05:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
though one of the things that that we're
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to need is more accurate
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
information right to tell us something
 
05:39:21.708 --> 05:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
about the extent to which these escars
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
are ending up in predators and their
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
lethality for for Predators but my
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
question for you is do we at least in
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
some applications do we end up putting
 
05:39:34.490 --> 05:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
ourselves uh kind of behind the eight
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
ball in in the sense that if we are
 
05:39:39.650 --> 05:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
doing damage to the Predator population
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
right if we think about the the pest
 
05:39:45.530 --> 05:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
control that is done Naturally by uh
 
05:39:49.190 --> 05:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
Predators like Raptors right uh at some
 
05:39:51.410 --> 05:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
level are we making the problem worse
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
because there is this question about why
 
05:39:54.650 --> 05:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a proliferation of of
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
rodents if we now have uh and have for
 
05:39:59.448 --> 05:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
quite some time had these pesticides
 
05:40:01.970 --> 05:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
which are are so effective so isn't
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
there at least in some applications the
 
05:40:09.410 --> 05:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
danger of doing damn image to Natural
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
Predators who would be taking out a
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
considerable number of of those rodents
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
if they were not affected by the
 
05:40:17.100 --> 05:40:19.310 align:start position:0%
if they were not affected by the
pesticides

05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
pesticides
 
05:40:22.550 --> 05:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
well yes you could technically have that
 
05:40:24.530 --> 05:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
as an issue but I mean as Adam was
 
05:40:26.570 --> 05:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
mentioning a house mouse for instance
 
05:40:29.330 --> 05:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
they don't leave a house a lot of our
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
clients we do a lot of multiple
 
05:40:32.448 --> 05:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
occupancy dwelling in downtown
 
05:40:32.458 --> 05:40:34.250 align:start position:0%
occupancy dwelling in downtown
Manchester

05:40:34.250 --> 05:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
that that's not an issue that's not the
 
05:40:39.770 --> 05:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
problem but that you can't seal
 
05:40:41.448 --> 05:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
especially with like fire codes and all
 
05:40:42.770 --> 05:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
this other stuff there's so many other
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
limiting factors that our rodenticides
 
05:40:47.690 --> 05:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
aren't even placed outside of the
 
05:40:50.330 --> 05:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
property but if they are responsibly
 
05:40:53.930 --> 05:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
used at or responsibly used and placed
 
05:40:53.940 --> 05:40:55.670 align:start position:0%
used at or responsibly used and placed
it's

05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
if it is a factor in the decline of of
 
05:41:01.788 --> 05:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
Predator animals it's
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
very far down the list of factors I mean
 
05:41:06.530 --> 05:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
I would say the fact that we're just
 
05:41:08.090 --> 05:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
building houses in their environment is
 
05:41:09.530 --> 05:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
driving more of them away and driving
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
them just environment loss is going to
 
05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
be more of a factor than rodenticide use
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it's enough to factor
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
in especially when weighed against sorry
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
for taking too long but especially when
 
05:41:25.610 --> 05:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
weighed against the diseases and the the
 
05:41:27.770 --> 05:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
problems that come from rats
 
05:41:27.780 --> 05:41:29.628 align:start position:0%
problems that come from rats
specifically

05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I mean you see it in other states
 
05:41:37.010 --> 05:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
that have the bands in a sense this and
 
05:41:39.050 --> 05:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
they're seeing increase especially in
 
05:41:40.930 --> 05:41:40.940 align:start position:0%
population centers of
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
these rodent instances but also the
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
disease diseases that they transmit
 
05:41:47.930 --> 05:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
which is again the primary function we
 
05:41:48.890 --> 05:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to just kill stuff for
 
05:41:50.750 --> 05:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
killing's sake the point is to protect
 
05:41:52.550 --> 05:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the people the residents of New
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's who we focus on
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
can I ask a quick follow-up sure sure
 
05:41:59.208 --> 05:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and so would you be in
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
favor of you've asked this so you should
 
05:42:03.170 --> 05:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
know it's coming right of of a working
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
group because it seems to me that not
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
only do we need the data but there are
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
also questions about what applications
 
05:42:11.090 --> 05:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
we have a list of exceptions here
 
05:42:13.010 --> 05:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps that list is not comprehensive
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
enough but would you be in favor of a
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
working group that would be designed to
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
aggregate this data and to talk about
 
05:42:23.690 --> 05:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate applications uh I mean who's
 
05:42:25.128 --> 05:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
ever going to be against more
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
information and more knowledge for that
 
05:42:29.690 --> 05:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
we do have a wonderful board that is
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
very robust and involved and they're
 
05:42:33.470 --> 05:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
easy to get a hold of they're easy to
 
05:42:35.690 --> 05:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
answer questions and so if you want to
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
add to that if it's not undue burden I
 
05:42:40.490 --> 05:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't see an issue with that as long as
 
05:42:43.970 --> 05:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
it then follows the existing enforcement
 
05:42:47.810 --> 05:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
and Rule regulating process but I don't
 
05:42:50.448 --> 05:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
see an issue with more information ever
 
05:42:52.368 --> 05:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
being a problem thank you thank you
 
05:43:26.810 --> 05:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
so the population just to clarify
 
05:43:31.368 --> 05:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
population of residents here not the
 
05:43:33.410 --> 05:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
rodent population are kind of both
 
05:43:35.810 --> 05:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the population of uh people
 
05:43:38.090 --> 05:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
moving uh right we've had a growth in
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
our population of people into the state
 
05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
and I live in a rural area and notice
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot more building going
 
05:43:48.410 --> 05:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
on uh which concerns me how the wildlife
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
is going to their normal track tracks
 
05:43:52.850 --> 05:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
through the woods they're going to have
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
to divert and everything else so with
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
the increase of population uh would that
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
help contribute to the rodent growth
 
05:44:03.590 --> 05:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
um yes and no what we've noticed so I've
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
my brother and I we've been in pest
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
control for over a decade and a piece
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
and what we've noticed is that anytime
 
05:44:12.530 --> 05:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
they clear ground for a new neighborhood
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
we always tend to get increased phone
 
05:44:16.250 --> 05:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
calls in the periphery of that area
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
where they've cleared obviously as we're
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
removing their habitat so yeah we're
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to display some and obviously
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
force them into where we live and
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
commensal rabbit rodents excuse me
 
05:44:29.208 --> 05:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
that's they live with humans
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
um so yes as we displaced the
 
05:44:33.770 --> 05:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
populations they'll move in with us and
 
05:44:35.810 --> 05:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
they'll they're very smart and they'll
 
05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
adapt to live with us very quickly but
 
05:44:44.330 --> 05:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
also sanitation is huge the rats as it
 
05:44:45.288 --> 05:44:45.298 align:start position:0%
was said earlier have been around
 
05:44:48.170 --> 05:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
forever with us uh you know we can think
 
05:44:49.610 --> 05:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
back to history some of the major
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
plagues have been transmitted by them
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
and so they're very Adept at living with
 
05:44:56.690 --> 05:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
us so I wouldn't say that the population
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
growth is fueled rats pretend per se but
 
05:45:04.970 --> 05:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
I would say that the poor sanitation and
 
05:45:07.610 --> 05:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
especially with you know garbage removal
 
05:45:12.288 --> 05:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
and uh just food wastes and uh we get a
 
05:45:13.850 --> 05:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
lot of clients where they have the bird
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
seed and they have the the chicken feed
 
05:45:19.070 --> 05:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it's just of course it's easy just
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
to throw it out and throw the bag and
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
you'll get it in the morning
 
05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
um but it's just it's the sanitation so
 
05:45:26.930 --> 05:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
much as not people don't breed rats they
 
05:45:26.940 --> 05:45:27.770 align:start position:0%
much as not people don't breed rats they
just

05:45:27.770 --> 05:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
like the same environments that we do
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they eat a lot of the same foods
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.530 --> 05:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any other
 
05:45:39.410 --> 05:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murray
 
05:45:41.090 --> 05:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sure thank you for my question uh
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for for
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
testifying and taking my question and
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
just to be clear is it the rodents
 
05:45:49.128 --> 05:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
themselves that are transferring the
 
05:45:51.708 --> 05:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
diseases or is it also fleas and ticks
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
and things like that that may live on
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
the rodents that are actually
 
05:45:57.890 --> 05:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
transmitting some of the diseases that
 
05:46:00.410 --> 05:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
you mentioned like plagues and other
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
tick-borne illnesses but my
 
05:46:04.850 --> 05:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a primary way that
 
05:46:04.860 --> 05:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a primary way that
um

05:46:05.750 --> 05:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:08.090 --> 05:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
tick-borne illness is is transmitted is
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
is through the fact that they live on
 
05:46:12.650 --> 05:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
mice and they live on deer
 
05:46:15.230 --> 05:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so I guess to that point is it The
 
05:46:17.208 --> 05:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
Mouse and the rat themselves or is it
 
05:46:20.208 --> 05:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
some of these other cohabitors it really
 
05:46:22.610 --> 05:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
depends on the disease but to your point
 
05:46:25.128 --> 05:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
yeah a rat doesn't transmit Lyme disease
 
05:46:27.708 --> 05:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
but a tick that's eaten it can't or
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
typical in the mice but so depending on
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
their disease it can be on the other
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
parasitic or other latch on you know
 
05:46:37.250 --> 05:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
fleas ticks things like that or there
 
05:46:38.930 --> 05:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
are some diseases that are transmitted
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
by the rodents themselves so
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
pick your problem I guess
 
05:46:46.490 --> 05:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any other
 
05:46:49.850 --> 05:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:46:51.890 --> 05:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for coming
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Joan O'Brien
 
05:46:57.120 --> 05:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Joan O'Brien
to

05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
so these are not instances that happen
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this is from out of
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you just to clarify
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
so my name is Joan O'Brien and I am
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
representing voices of wildlife in New
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today
 
05:47:53.470 --> 05:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
to start citizens of New Hampshire care
 
05:47:58.490 --> 05:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
deeply about wildlife and that's why
 
05:48:01.070 --> 05:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
stories of poison owls and Eagles make
 
05:48:02.930 --> 05:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
the front page and get on the Nightly
 
05:48:02.940 --> 05:48:04.190 align:start position:0%
the front page and get on the Nightly
News

05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
News
 
05:48:06.410 --> 05:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
no one wants to see these animals
 
05:48:06.420 --> 05:48:07.610 align:start position:0%
no one wants to see these animals
suffering

05:48:07.610 --> 05:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
and dying and that's why we're here
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
appealing to you our elected officials
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
to do something to make it stop
 
05:48:17.930 --> 05:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
there's been discussion about cost to
 
05:48:19.970 --> 05:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
homeowners of one solution versus the
 
05:48:23.330 --> 05:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
other let's not forget the cost of
 
05:48:25.368 --> 05:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
losing these animals the cost to New
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of losing losing these animals
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
and the cost of the anguish that people
 
05:48:32.750 --> 05:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
feel when they read a story about how an
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
owl you know was sick and fell from its
 
05:48:39.310 --> 05:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
nest dead from poisons people are
 
05:48:44.090 --> 05:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:44.100 --> 05:48:45.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:48:45.730 --> 05:48:45.740 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:48:48.410 --> 05:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
Solutions can be more expensive up front
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
but if they last you can save money in
 
05:48:54.170 --> 05:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
in the long run when we arrived in New
 
05:48:55.788 --> 05:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and bought our home we took
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
over a contract to have rodenticide put
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
around our house we thought we better do
 
05:49:03.708 --> 05:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
that because the previous owners had it
 
05:49:05.330 --> 05:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to risk a rodent
 
05:49:05.340 --> 05:49:06.830 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to risk a rodent
infestation

05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
infestation
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
and since then I learned about the
 
05:49:11.930 --> 05:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
dangers nobody ever said to me that
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
there was an alternative they would come
 
05:49:16.128 --> 05:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
they would check they would report that
 
05:49:18.170 --> 05:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
they'd been feeding in the rodent
 
05:49:20.030 --> 05:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
stations so I assumed well I've got a
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
mouse problem so I better keep this
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
spending the money on this and it's
 
05:49:26.690 --> 05:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars a quarter so you
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
take that and put it into some you know
 
05:49:31.670 --> 05:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
upfront solution and then you don't have
 
05:49:33.830 --> 05:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
to pay you know these these quarterly
 
05:49:33.840 --> 05:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
to pay you know these these quarterly
bills

05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:49:37.730 --> 05:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
um which is what I did I used copper
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
mesh and I Mouse proofed the house and I
 
05:49:44.810 --> 05:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:46.850 --> 05:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's well documented that these poisons
 
05:49:48.890 --> 05:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on Wildlife we've
 
05:49:50.090 --> 05:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
gone through all the studies today
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
they're in your packet one animal nobody
 
05:49:54.410 --> 05:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
has mentioned I don't believe is the
 
05:49:56.090 --> 05:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
Northern Harrier which is a state
 
05:49:59.690 --> 05:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
endangered bird which would also be you
 
05:50:01.448 --> 05:50:01.458 align:start position:0%
know vulnerable to eating these poisons
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Audubon found just one
 
05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
nesting site in the whole state for the
 
05:50:08.930 --> 05:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
northern harrier we don't want to lose
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.448 --> 05:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
and it's important to point out that
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
businesses are not required to use these
 
05:50:17.930 --> 05:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
poisons what they're required to do is
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
to provide a sanitary environment
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
and there are safe and effective
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
Alternatives we've talked about snap
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
traps and some other things that are
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
expensive but birth control for rodents
 
05:50:32.330 --> 05:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
is an up-and-coming area and shows some
 
05:50:32.340 --> 05:50:33.850 align:start position:0%
is an up-and-coming area and shows some
promise

05:50:33.850 --> 05:50:33.860 align:start position:0%
promise
 
05:50:36.650 --> 05:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
on page 35 of the packet you got at the
 
05:50:39.650 --> 05:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
beginning it lists some Alternatives
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
including Contra pests which is a form
 
05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
of birth control
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
and you can be sure that the pest
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
control industry is looking into all of
 
05:50:50.570 --> 05:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
these Alternatives because they have
 
05:50:52.190 --> 05:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're seeing the bands coming and
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:51:00.410 --> 05:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
birth control is something that you
 
05:51:02.270 --> 05:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
would have to apply at regular intervals
 
05:51:05.230 --> 05:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
so there is a chance to to make it into
 
05:51:08.330 --> 05:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
a profitable business in the same way
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
that the poisons that are applied at
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
regular intervals are profitable as and
 
05:51:15.890 --> 05:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's Humane nobody is dying of you know
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say one last thing is
 
05:51:29.208 --> 05:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
that British Columbia had a moratorium
 
05:51:32.690 --> 05:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
on these second generation anticoagulant
 
05:51:32.700 --> 05:51:34.250 align:start position:0%
on these second generation anticoagulant
regenticides

05:51:34.250 --> 05:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
regenticides
 
05:51:37.310 --> 05:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
they they instituted a moratorium for 18
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
months during which time they did a
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
study and at the end of that period
 
05:51:43.730 --> 05:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
which was three days ago
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
those poisons are now banned in British
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
Columbia as of as of January 21st so I
 
05:51:50.638 --> 05:51:51.770 align:start position:0%
Columbia as of as of January 21st so I
think

05:51:51.770 --> 05:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:51:54.170 --> 05:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
we would find whatever they found if we
 
05:51:55.970 --> 05:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
did a study I mean animals are the same
 
05:51:57.350 --> 05:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere and the poisons are the same
 
05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere so thank you for taking my
 
05:52:00.120 --> 05:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
everywhere so thank you for taking my
testimony

05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:52:03.170 --> 05:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I have a
 
05:52:03.180 --> 05:52:04.490 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I have a
question

05:52:04.490 --> 05:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:52:06.770 --> 05:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
um if if we did apply birth control
 
05:52:10.490 --> 05:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
methods for these rodents wouldn't the
 
05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
Predators also be ingesting birth
 
05:52:12.600 --> 05:52:14.930 align:start position:0%
Predators also be ingesting birth
control

05:52:14.930 --> 05:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:14.940 --> 05:52:17.448 align:start position:0%
 
chemicals

05:52:17.448 --> 05:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
05:52:19.548 --> 05:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
I I suppose they would and I don't know
 
05:52:21.470 --> 05:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
about anything about how what would
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
happen then thank you any other
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:52:30.770 --> 05:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
today I'd like to call Kurt Ehrenberg
 
05:52:40.368 --> 05:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon this late afternoon
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and uh I will be
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
brief uh I'm Kurt Ehrenberg I'm the
 
05:52:50.208 --> 05:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
state director for the Humane Society
 
05:52:53.330 --> 05:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
the United States and our job is to
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
protect the animals so I'm here
 
05:53:00.288 --> 05:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
because I think what I've heard is the
 
05:53:03.410 --> 05:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
science is pretty clear uh these
 
05:53:06.610 --> 05:53:06.620 align:start position:0%
pesticides damage our wildlife
 
05:53:09.310 --> 05:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
not allow these pesticides to be used
 
05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
but I have not heard
 
05:53:22.128 --> 05:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
that that would be all that impactful
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of the residential use of these
 
05:53:30.170 --> 05:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh the former types of pesticides
 
05:53:30.180 --> 05:53:32.208 align:start position:0%
uh the former types of pesticides
um

05:53:32.208 --> 05:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:34.490 --> 05:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
please think about
 
05:53:37.490 --> 05:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
the future of the wildlife of the state
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity we've heard that
 
05:53:43.010 --> 05:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
these have been used for decades since
 
05:53:45.530 --> 05:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
the 70s or 80s
 
05:53:48.530 --> 05:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
so we heard the Commissioner of
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture say there is a problem
 
05:53:53.570 --> 05:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
we heard him say the governor went to
 
05:53:57.288 --> 05:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
him and said fix this problem
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is a fixed to the problem
 
05:54:03.650 --> 05:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
we support this bill
 
05:54:07.010 --> 05:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
if the committee in its wisdom thought
 
05:54:09.650 --> 05:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
there should be some
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
study that would augment in some way the
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
pesticide body board that is already
 
05:54:17.570 --> 05:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
looking at these things clearly
 
05:54:20.930 --> 05:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
ineffective in my opinion
 
05:54:23.230 --> 05:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with these pesticides
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
getting into our Wildlife for decades
 
05:54:29.330 --> 05:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
they're not doing anything about it
 
05:54:31.910 --> 05:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
so we've heard that there is a problem
 
05:54:34.250 --> 05:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner the governor's
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
asked him to do something about it we're
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
asking you to pass this Bill thank you
 
05:54:39.288 --> 05:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:54:41.040 --> 05:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:54:46.490 --> 05:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd also like to call up Ted
 
05:54:48.948 --> 05:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
Brayton thank you for your testimony Ted
 
05:54:48.958 --> 05:55:10.910 align:start position:0%
Brayton thank you for your testimony Ted

05:55:13.490 --> 05:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
put on your microphone there there you
 
05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
go I thought I saw red from the back of
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
the room thank you welcome thank you
 
05:55:18.770 --> 05:55:18.780 align:start position:0%

Professionals in New Hampshire and I am
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
here at today to oppose House Bill 326.
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
you've already heard from a couple of my
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues I could have brought more
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
today but I wanted to try to minimize
 
05:55:36.530 --> 05:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
the redundancy in our testimonies for
 
05:55:38.690 --> 05:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
your time's sake we thank you when I
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
when I first started in the industry 30
 
05:55:43.010 --> 05:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
years ago almost all of our rodent calls
 
05:55:44.690 --> 05:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
came in between September and December
 
05:55:46.610 --> 05:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
we were told that was because the first
 
05:55:48.230 --> 05:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
Frost would be taking away their food
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
sauce and they were coming in looking
 
05:55:50.868 --> 05:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
for food
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
that just isn't the case anymore they
 
05:55:55.010 --> 05:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
are coming in year round and often bring
 
05:55:57.170 --> 05:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
in their own food supplies like grass
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
seed bird seed and acorns we now are
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
getting calls year round and are
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
actually having more calls for rodents
 
05:56:04.368 --> 05:56:04.378 align:start position:0%
than ants for the second consecutive
 
05:56:04.378 --> 05:56:05.810 align:start position:0%
than ants for the second consecutive
summer

05:56:05.810 --> 05:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
summer
 
05:56:08.330 --> 05:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
in my experience all types of wildlife
 
05:56:10.850 --> 05:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
appear to be thriving I never saw a deer
 
05:56:13.010 --> 05:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
or turkey in the wild when I was a kid I
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
now see deer and turkeys on the side of

asked me what's that smell

the EPA is in the process of finalizing

some new rules regarding sjr's
 
05:58:18.048 --> 05:58:18.058 align:start position:0%
that will increase training requirements
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
and restrictions on licensed structural
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
applicators like ourselves
 
05:58:24.850 --> 05:58:24.860 align:start position:0%
that apply over 90 percent of our
 
05:58:27.650 --> 05:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
rodenticides inside the structures not
 
05:58:30.170 --> 05:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
out and near the fields in the woods
 
05:58:32.208 --> 05:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
they are also severely restricting
 
05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
rodentside access to homeowners for
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural applications where I would
 
05:58:36.360 --> 05:58:37.250 align:start position:0%
agricultural applications where I would
think

05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:58:39.530 --> 05:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
the intersection of wildlife is much
 
05:58:41.930 --> 05:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
more likely to be happening
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
I ask that you not get ahead of the
 
05:58:45.410 --> 05:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
science New Hampshire and continue to
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
leave the pesticide regulations to the
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
EPA and the division of pest control
 
05:58:50.690 --> 05:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
within the department of agricultural
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
markets and food
 
05:58:54.890 --> 05:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
as for an update from California I have
 
05:58:56.990 --> 05:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
several colleagues in California I
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
believe this rule has been in place for
 
05:59:00.830 --> 05:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
about a year and what they tell me is in
 
05:59:03.170 --> 05:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
the inner cities the calls are up the
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
costs are doing business in the inner
 
05:59:06.650 --> 05:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
cities are up and in the affluent
 
05:59:08.510 --> 05:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where the houses are
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
starting off in a better place and the
 
05:59:13.490 --> 05:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
homeowners can afford more exclusion
 
05:59:15.530 --> 05:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
they were more available for providing
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
additional sanitation and can afford the
 
05:59:19.430 --> 05:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
more frequent visits required with
 
05:59:21.170 --> 05:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
trapping and first generation
 
05:59:23.090 --> 05:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
rosenthocytes those folks are doing okay
 
05:59:27.288 --> 05:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
but the inner city the cost calls are up
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
I thank you for allowing the time today
 
05:59:31.010 --> 05:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
to voice my opposition the house bill
 
05:59:33.170 --> 05:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
326 I have also submitted written
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
testimony and available for any of your
 
05:59:35.458 --> 05:59:36.948 align:start position:0%
testimony and available for any of your
questions

05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative knabb
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm not sure
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
you'll have the answer to this but a few
 
05:59:45.170 --> 05:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned the EPA regulation
 
05:59:47.208 --> 05:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try you
 
05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
um are there other recommendations
 
05:59:50.330 --> 05:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
outside of the two that have been
 
05:59:51.288 --> 05:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
mentioned by a couple of people
 
05:59:53.810 --> 05:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
collecting the dead carcasses and using
 
05:59:57.048 --> 05:59:57.058 align:start position:0%
boxes because it seems like those don't
 
05:59:59.448 --> 05:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
go that far to address the issue here
 
06:00:03.650 --> 06:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is already Incorporated in
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
the present requirements in labels so
 
06:00:08.690 --> 06:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
what they're looking at specifically is
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
some additional requirements on I
 
06:00:13.368 --> 06:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
believe it's 11 different uh products
 
06:00:15.410 --> 06:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
for those Products off the top of my
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
head we're looking at restricted use
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
which takes it away uh from the
 
06:00:20.160 --> 06:00:21.788 align:start position:0%
which takes it away uh from the
homeowner

06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
is going to increase some licensing
 
06:00:27.170 --> 06:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
requirements and some training uh credit
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
hours for folks Like Us in the industry
 
06:00:32.930 --> 06:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's going to require some additional
 
06:00:35.048 --> 06:00:35.058 align:start position:0%
training meetings and some paperwork
 
06:00:36.830 --> 06:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
from that
 
06:00:40.610 --> 06:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at proposed regulations
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
for protective personal equipment such
 
06:00:45.670 --> 06:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
as gloves and
 
06:00:48.770 --> 06:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
some respirators for tracking powders
 
06:00:51.650 --> 06:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
and pelletized loose bait that are often
 
06:00:55.368 --> 06:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
put in rodent Burrows and uh which
 
06:00:57.708 --> 06:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect us presently they have
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
some more stringent requirements that
 
06:01:02.208 --> 06:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
they're proposing in place in areas
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
where they have documented endangered
 
06:01:08.510 --> 06:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
species where they are much more uh
 
06:01:10.610 --> 06:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
restrictive as far as what can be used
 
06:01:13.810 --> 06:01:13.820 align:start position:0%
how long it can it can go out and then
 
06:01:13.820 --> 06:01:15.490 align:start position:0%
how long it can it can go out and then
regular

06:01:15.490 --> 06:01:15.500 align:start position:0%
regular
 
06:01:21.770 --> 06:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.690 --> 06:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
and obviously that's the bulk of it
 
06:01:27.650 --> 06:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:30.650 --> 06:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
06:01:33.530 --> 06:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:01:34.810 --> 06:01:34.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time today
 
06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
I actually have an extra question for uh
 
06:01:39.650 --> 06:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
Mr Russo
 
06:01:42.288 --> 06:01:42.298 align:start position:0%
and his colleague
 
06:01:45.170 --> 06:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
and that is just a personal uh you know
 
06:01:49.490 --> 06:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
question with regard to chemicals that
 
06:01:52.368 --> 06:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
are have been used or the chemicals that
 
06:01:54.610 --> 06:01:54.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is there any kind of
 
06:02:00.048 --> 06:02:00.058 align:start position:0%
chemical that could be combined with
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
these rodenticides that would result in
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rodent
 
06:02:05.760 --> 06:02:07.610 align:start position:0%
the rodent
being

06:02:07.610 --> 06:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:02:07.620 --> 06:02:09.650 align:start position:0%
being
unpalatable

06:02:09.650 --> 06:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
unpalatable
 
06:02:14.030 --> 06:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:15.708 --> 06:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
do you know of anything like that great
 
06:02:15.718 --> 06:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
do you know of anything like that great
question

06:02:17.570 --> 06:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:19.368 --> 06:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not aware of anything like that
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have Incorporated uh
 
06:02:25.250 --> 06:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
the ability to track animals using
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
luminescence so when an animal ingests
 
06:02:30.350 --> 06:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
the product you can track their feces
 
06:02:31.730 --> 06:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
and their trails and find out where they
 
06:02:34.490 --> 06:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
go to be more efficient at uh at
 
06:02:36.530 --> 06:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
Exterminating them or trapping them or
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
baiting for them but as far as making
 
06:02:40.730 --> 06:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
them less palatable I'm not I'm not
 
06:02:42.890 --> 06:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
aware of anything like that okay thank
 
06:02:42.900 --> 06:02:44.570 align:start position:0%
aware of anything like that okay thank
you

06:02:44.570 --> 06:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:02:47.030 --> 06:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Russo while
 
06:02:48.610 --> 06:02:48.620 align:start position:0%
he's here yeah
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza I'm so glad she
 
06:02:53.330 --> 06:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
brought you back up
 
06:02:53.340 --> 06:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
brought you back up
so

06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:58.910 --> 06:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm for of course less government all
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
of that I don't want encroachment on
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that's you know that's my
 
06:03:05.448 --> 06:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
core but when listening to all this
 
06:03:08.090 --> 06:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
testimony it just seems to me I think
 
06:03:09.530 --> 06:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
that the bill could be written so much
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
better but why isn't it why can't it be
 
06:03:14.750 --> 06:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
for the state for example because this
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
is really focused on the state which of
 
06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
course will impact businesses as well
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
why couldn't you use all of those other
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
options and have literally the poison be
 
06:03:27.048 --> 06:03:27.058 align:start position:0%
the last resort especially in the cities
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about you said
 
06:03:31.250 --> 06:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a problem all over why
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
aren't we focusing like in Manchester
 
06:03:35.150 --> 06:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
for example if we're in you know if
 
06:03:38.090 --> 06:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
we're in specifically urban areas why
 
06:03:39.770 --> 06:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
can't we do
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the electric shock why can't
 
06:03:44.330 --> 06:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
we do I know New York City did I think
 
06:03:46.730 --> 06:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
they did cats at one point but I'm not
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we throw a whole bunch of
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
cats in the city but I just don't
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
understand why we couldn't have a a
 
06:03:55.850 --> 06:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
pecking order in a sense of what we're
 
06:03:58.490 --> 06:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
using in The Last Resort be the poison
 
06:03:58.500 --> 06:04:00.048 align:start position:0%
using in The Last Resort be the poison
and

06:04:00.048 --> 06:04:00.058 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:01.910 --> 06:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know if anybody else on
 
06:04:04.128 --> 06:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
this committee we had a house when
 
06:04:06.770 --> 06:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
um we lived in Concord at the time in in
 
06:04:08.750 --> 06:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
my kids were little they were they were
 
06:04:10.610 --> 06:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
two and three and there was a mouse
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem it was pretty much a brand new
 
06:04:14.570 --> 06:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
house and it was ridiculous they left
 
06:04:16.850 --> 06:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
the garage open all the time we went
 
06:04:19.070 --> 06:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
through every single
 
06:04:22.850 --> 06:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
um Avenue to get rid of those mice and
 
06:04:26.330 --> 06:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
those black boxes that were outside the
 
06:04:28.368 --> 06:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
glue traps everything you could possibly
 
06:04:30.048 --> 06:04:30.058 align:start position:0%
have snap traps I didn't like those at
 
06:04:31.250 --> 06:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
all of course because I had little
 
06:04:33.410 --> 06:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
children and the only thing that worked
 
06:04:36.288 --> 06:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
were the no kill traps with a little bit
 
06:04:37.970 --> 06:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
of peanut butter in it that's what
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
worked we tried everything and the other
 
06:04:42.770 --> 06:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
thing that is so unbelievable that we
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
did in our home was we used foam
 
06:04:47.690 --> 06:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
insulation we we did all of that first
 
06:04:49.490 --> 06:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
and that was really unbelievable too
 
06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're not coming in
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
I mean we've got a surplus in the state
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry do you have a
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
question I know so I'm just saying isn't
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can get parties to
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
the table and and have a solution on
 
06:05:04.368 --> 06:05:04.378 align:start position:0%
this bill that makes more sense that I
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't know not just a study committee
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
we've got a surplus of money
 
06:05:10.670 --> 06:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
if it's going to cost more to in on the
 
06:05:14.448 --> 06:05:14.458 align:start position:0%
out front why can't we make that happen
 
06:05:17.330 --> 06:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
and save our lives at the same time yeah
 
06:05:19.310 --> 06:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I think that with
 
06:05:19.320 --> 06:05:21.048 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I think that with
um

06:05:21.048 --> 06:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:23.510 --> 06:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
population controls there's a number of
 
06:05:25.368 --> 06:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
variables in your Urban environment is
 
06:05:27.530 --> 06:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to be different than Rural and
 
06:05:30.350 --> 06:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
suburb and so the approach can be
 
06:05:31.490 --> 06:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
different and I think what we heard
 
06:05:33.048 --> 06:05:33.058 align:start position:0%
today from The Pest Control folks is if
 
06:05:35.868 --> 06:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
there's an infestation the the the the
 
06:05:38.208 --> 06:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
non-chemical methods are really a real
 
06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know challenge to make that work
 
06:05:42.288 --> 06:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
um integrated Pest Management is
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
something we always include in our
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
training and that that somewhat
 
06:05:48.890 --> 06:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
um identify as you try everything before
 
06:05:50.448 --> 06:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
you get to the chemical but but not
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
always it'll come down to the the level
 
06:05:54.288 --> 06:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
of the population but but that and we've
 
06:05:55.970 --> 06:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
been you know that's been a topic for
 
06:05:58.850 --> 06:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
for many years and uh
 
06:06:01.128 --> 06:06:01.138 align:start position:0%
um it just it seems like we're
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
um as far as how do you how do you you
 
06:06:04.730 --> 06:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
know how do you mandate you know you use
 
06:06:06.288 --> 06:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
the snap trap before the chemical I
 
06:06:07.490 --> 06:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how you'd approach
 
06:06:08.750 --> 06:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
that and I don't know if I'd even
 
06:06:11.150 --> 06:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that depends I think it comes
 
06:06:12.410 --> 06:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
down to the variables and the
 
06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
infestation levels
 
06:06:16.430 --> 06:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
06:06:20.208 --> 06:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh one of the other people
 
06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
testifying mentioned the development of
 
06:06:25.970 --> 06:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh birth control which could be uh
 
06:06:30.650 --> 06:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
baited to the uh for rodents uh are you
 
06:06:33.530 --> 06:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
aware of any developments in that and
 
06:06:35.330 --> 06:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
does that seem to have a promise on the
 
06:06:35.340 --> 06:06:36.410 align:start position:0%
does that seem to have a promise on the
horizon

06:06:36.410 --> 06:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
horizon
 
06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we we've um I think the closest
 
06:06:40.200 --> 06:06:41.448 align:start position:0%
yeah we we've um I think the closest
um

06:06:41.448 --> 06:06:41.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:43.128 --> 06:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
municipality I can think of that really
 
06:06:45.048 --> 06:06:45.058 align:start position:0%
instituted the birth control concept was
 
06:06:46.970 --> 06:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
Somerville Massachusetts and we took in
 
06:06:46.980 --> 06:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
Somerville Massachusetts and we took in
a

06:06:47.750 --> 06:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
um a presentation of two or three years
 
06:06:51.530 --> 06:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
back now
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
um in regards to that but I couldn't I
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer how how successful they
 
06:06:57.230 --> 06:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
are with that with that program of
 
06:06:59.090 --> 06:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
course it doesn't um terminate the
 
06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
population it just um it drops the
 
06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
population that that's the that's the uh
 
06:07:04.730 --> 06:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
concept behind it is to limit the
 
06:07:04.740 --> 06:07:07.250 align:start position:0%
concept behind it is to limit the
numbers

06:07:07.250 --> 06:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:07:12.650 --> 06:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
06:07:15.530 --> 06:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
chair uh and so would you find it useful
 
06:07:17.448 --> 06:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking through the
 
06:07:19.250 --> 06:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
um the membership of the pest control
 
06:07:23.208 --> 06:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
board uh it seems that one piece that
 
06:07:24.470 --> 06:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm skimming back through it again
 
06:07:26.510 --> 06:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
now uh this seems to be missing we've
 
06:07:28.250 --> 06:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
had some some testimony here from the
 
06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabilitators uh do you think
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
that that is an important piece of the
 
06:07:35.930 --> 06:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
equation for the board to be able to
 
06:07:40.250 --> 06:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
have to get some more data around the
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
impact of uh these pesticides
 
06:07:45.410 --> 06:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
particularly in Wildlife which I know is
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
separate from say more urban areas but
 
06:07:49.368 --> 06:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
that does seem to be a piece that's
 
06:07:52.368 --> 06:07:52.378 align:start position:0%
missing from representation on the board
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
the um Fish and Game component on the
 
06:07:55.200 --> 06:07:56.448 align:start position:0%
the um Fish and Game component on the
board

06:07:56.448 --> 06:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:07:57.890 --> 06:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and I can't speak for other agencies
 
06:08:00.288 --> 06:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
but but during the the discourse of of
 
06:08:03.288 --> 06:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
of the car of the topic it would be more
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
than likely that fish and game would say
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know what whether what are we
 
06:08:08.330 --> 06:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
hearing from the wildlife rehab centers
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that does need to play into
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
the input how the board wants to um
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
engage that
 
06:08:15.530 --> 06:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
um they could either have a work group
 
06:08:17.510 --> 06:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
like was discussed or they could ask the
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
rehab centers if they'd be comfortable
 
06:08:21.170 --> 06:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
sharing their information
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and maybe have a few meetings
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the year where it includes
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
that group as well as maybe a
 
06:08:27.708 --> 06:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the board the boy
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
historically has been very good at
 
06:08:31.128 --> 06:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
rooting out
 
06:08:33.770 --> 06:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
um these these types of challenges
 
06:08:35.090 --> 06:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
um but I think it would be helpful to
 
06:08:37.430 --> 06:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
have that input from the wildlife rehab
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
folks and there was one other was
 
06:08:41.690 --> 06:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned was that the UNH um yeah and
 
06:08:43.730 --> 06:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
and that one is somewhat of an
 
06:08:46.250 --> 06:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
embarrassment to me that that uh that we
 
06:08:47.330 --> 06:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't have that we didn't have that
 
06:08:50.090 --> 06:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
immediate conversation with UNH lab we
 
06:08:51.650 --> 06:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
should have I don't know how that
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
dropped off the plate but uh the
 
06:08:55.010 --> 06:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
information that they collected in
 
06:08:56.208 --> 06:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
regards to the studies that they've done
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
with with rodenticides those two pieces
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the lab and the wildlife rehab would
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
be really helpful to this discussion for
 
06:09:04.080 --> 06:09:08.208 align:start position:0%
be really helpful to this discussion for
sure

06:09:08.208 --> 06:09:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:11.208 --> 06:09:11.218 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Bixby so um
 
06:09:14.570 --> 06:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that uh you know there
 
06:09:16.610 --> 06:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
were some people mentioned a preference
 
06:09:19.610 --> 06:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
for the us as legislators to get the
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
working group going uh other people
 
06:09:24.890 --> 06:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned the preference for the working
 
06:09:27.288 --> 06:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
group to be initiated by the board of
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
pest control pesticide control one of
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that I'm looking at is that
 
06:09:34.368 --> 06:09:34.378 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill so we need to act
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
on it pretty soon and it's I think it's
 
06:09:39.410 --> 06:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
going to be before I think we may need
 
06:09:41.990 --> 06:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
to uh have the action out of this
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee before your next meeting and
 
06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh which means that
 
06:09:50.990 --> 06:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of balancing the the
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
timing on that's a little bit of a
 
06:09:57.410 --> 06:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
challenge uh would you if we chose to uh
 
06:09:59.930 --> 06:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
put this in as a bill would you be
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
profoundly offended by that
 
06:10:05.448 --> 06:10:05.458 align:start position:0%
would I be offended if if the bill were
 
06:10:07.730 --> 06:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh we put in a bill to make that to make
 
06:10:11.208 --> 06:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
a working group oh I see my Audubon
 
06:10:11.218 --> 06:10:12.048 align:start position:0%
a working group oh I see my Audubon
um

06:10:12.048 --> 06:10:12.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:13.490 --> 06:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen there'll be
 
06:10:15.650 --> 06:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
there'll be an action by the board you
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
know whether whatever they determine as
 
06:10:19.490 --> 06:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
far as the work group itself and as I
 
06:10:20.930 --> 06:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned the board meeting is coming up
 
06:10:22.850 --> 06:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
on February 6th
 
06:10:24.590 --> 06:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
and they're aware of what's going on
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
here and and they'll they'll probably
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
want to include that information from
 
06:10:29.930 --> 06:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
the other groups I mean that's how they
 
06:10:32.090 --> 06:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
go about their businesses they they try
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
to gather as much information as they
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
can to to to address the concern so I I
 
06:10:39.230 --> 06:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't know if they'd be
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
offended I don't know if I could answer
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not on the board so uh okay I don't
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
know yeah thank you uh representative
 
06:10:46.320 --> 06:10:48.170 align:start position:0%
know yeah thank you uh representative
Murray

06:10:48.170 --> 06:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
06:10:50.330 --> 06:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I did just have
 
06:10:52.610 --> 06:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
one follow-up question with regard to
 
06:10:54.890 --> 06:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
sort of the communications between
 
06:10:56.510 --> 06:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's UNH Fish and Game
 
06:10:58.970 --> 06:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
yourselves I know that when study
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
committees are formed in this body or
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's other working groups that I
 
06:11:06.170 --> 06:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
oftentimes other departments are carbon
 
06:11:09.230 --> 06:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
copied on those types of things is that
 
06:11:11.270 --> 06:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
just is that a best practice thing or is
 
06:11:13.250 --> 06:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
that something that is outlined in
 
06:11:15.470 --> 06:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
statute to you all to ensure that that
 
06:11:18.170 --> 06:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
is facilitated so that nobody's sort of
 
06:11:20.570 --> 06:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
missing one another in the future that
 
06:11:22.910 --> 06:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
sort of these communications for studies
 
06:11:25.610 --> 06:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
like you mentioned with UNH aren't
 
06:11:29.330 --> 06:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not quite sure I understand the
 
06:11:34.190 --> 06:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
question of but typically when a
 
06:11:36.170 --> 06:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
pesticide issue comes up we are a
 
06:11:38.990 --> 06:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
notified a study especially within the
 
06:11:41.090 --> 06:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
state and I'm not I'm not faulting you
 
06:11:42.890 --> 06:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
know whatever the community how where
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the communication breakdown was I think
 
06:11:46.850 --> 06:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
it was an opportunity that came up there
 
06:11:48.670 --> 06:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
was some there was some money available
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
offered to fish and game to to have that
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
study conducted and I think the lab just
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
happened to be the best place for the
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
for the I don't think it was a a
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
situation where someone just you know
 
06:12:02.030 --> 06:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
didn't take the time to say oh we got to
 
06:12:05.090 --> 06:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
pull pesticides in this discussion early
 
06:12:07.788 --> 06:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
um so no we're not always obligated to
 
06:12:10.010 --> 06:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know whenever we do outside topic
 
06:12:12.770 --> 06:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
work to immediately contact you know
 
06:12:14.448 --> 06:12:14.458 align:start position:0%
other agencies we do it as a practice
 
06:12:15.890 --> 06:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I think we're I think we're done
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
good with it in this state actually
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but that that one fell off the and I
 
06:12:22.250 --> 06:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
think it fell off the the the the table
 
06:12:22.260 --> 06:12:23.330 align:start position:0%
think it fell off the the the the table
because

06:12:23.330 --> 06:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:12:24.770 --> 06:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
um someone was trying to do the best
 
06:12:26.570 --> 06:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
they could they had an opportunity I you
 
06:12:28.730 --> 06:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
know I really believe that
 
06:12:31.610 --> 06:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh sure representative Murray thank you
 
06:12:32.930 --> 06:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
very much and and to be clear that's
 
06:12:34.250 --> 06:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
what I was just trying to make sure that
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
there wasn't something that needed to be
 
06:12:37.610 --> 06:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
stipulated so that you you all could
 
06:12:39.048 --> 06:12:39.058 align:start position:0%
talk to one another or something like
 
06:12:41.090 --> 06:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative NAB you have a question
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
clarify ask we don't have any stats
 
06:12:49.610 --> 06:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
Authority statutory authority to direct
 
06:12:52.970 --> 06:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
who if you do a subcommittee to discuss
 
06:12:54.590 --> 06:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
this as part of the pesticide control
 
06:12:56.510 --> 06:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
group who's on it
 
06:12:58.548 --> 06:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
like is there a way for us to say hey
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
could you make sure you include the
 
06:13:01.610 --> 06:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
Audubon Society and
 
06:13:03.948 --> 06:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
you know wildlife rehabilitator
 
06:13:05.868 --> 06:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
outside of creating a separate working
 
06:13:08.208 --> 06:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
group that is sort of gonna in a lot of
 
06:13:10.368 --> 06:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
ways overlap what you're already doing
 
06:13:12.048 --> 06:13:12.058 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't even think I can I could
 
06:13:13.970 --> 06:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
answer that about statutory Authority
 
06:13:16.250 --> 06:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
and and specifics of a work group I
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
think if you pass a law I mean we have
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
to abide by but I don't know how that
 
06:13:21.410 --> 06:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
would work but you're amenable to having
 
06:13:24.890 --> 06:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
such groups on a subcommittee again I'm
 
06:13:26.690 --> 06:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
not on the board I would recommend that
 
06:13:28.610 --> 06:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
to them and then and typically when the
 
06:13:30.470 --> 06:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
division recommends especially a study
 
06:13:32.330 --> 06:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
that they're pretty amenable to to to to
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
to you know bringing that as part of the
 
06:13:35.868 --> 06:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
discussion and
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
um earlier a discussion of birds was
 
06:13:39.590 --> 06:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned and and we did pull in people
 
06:13:41.810 --> 06:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
from outside and uh and that's pretty
 
06:13:43.850 --> 06:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
much standard practice as you go to The
 
06:13:46.730 --> 06:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
Experts and if the wild life rehab folks
 
06:13:48.770 --> 06:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
are seeing this on a K on you know on
 
06:13:51.288 --> 06:13:51.298 align:start position:0%
occasions that they mentioned then you
 
06:13:53.690 --> 06:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
know I think it's fair game to say what
 
06:13:54.770 --> 06:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
does that look like you know how many
 
06:13:56.750 --> 06:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
animals and
 
06:13:58.490 --> 06:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
um whatever other information they have
 
06:14:01.010 --> 06:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
so I I can tell you right now I'm going
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
to say this to the board on February 6.
 
06:14:05.030 --> 06:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we ought to invite you know
 
06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehab representative in in UNH
 
06:14:08.100 --> 06:14:09.350 align:start position:0%

06:14:11.570 --> 06:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
um to this discussion and and go from
 
06:14:11.580 --> 06:14:13.128 align:start position:0%
um to this discussion and and go from
there

06:14:13.128 --> 06:14:13.138 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:14:14.810 --> 06:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:17.810 --> 06:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh and we
 
06:14:19.368 --> 06:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
are out of pink cards if anybody else
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
would like to make a
 
06:14:24.470 --> 06:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
you sir back there please fill out a
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
pink card and uh
 
06:14:33.470 --> 06:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:35.150 --> 06:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you can fill it in after you
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
testify but uh
 
06:14:38.390 --> 06:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
please state your name where are you
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
from yes thank you I'm Paul dubo Grafton
 
06:14:42.170 --> 06:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
County New Hampshire fishing game
 
06:14:44.208 --> 06:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm on the legislative
 
06:14:46.850 --> 06:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh with that group and they
 
06:14:48.170 --> 06:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
asked me to come today because I'm
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
actually a wildlife control operator I
 
06:14:52.850 --> 06:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
don't use these baits I seal up houses
 
06:14:54.288 --> 06:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
like the guys are talking about the
 
06:14:56.690 --> 06:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
exclusion process so I'm very familiar
 
06:14:57.650 --> 06:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:14:57.660 --> 06:14:58.610 align:start position:0%
with that
um

06:14:58.610 --> 06:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:01.128 --> 06:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
my squirrel work does not cover mice I
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
never give warranty on mice because they
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
just show up and they continue to show
 
06:15:04.320 --> 06:15:05.810 align:start position:0%
just show up and they continue to show
up

06:15:05.810 --> 06:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
um our our subcommittee uh talked about
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
this at Great length not quite three
 
06:15:11.810 --> 06:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
hours but we talked about this at Great
 
06:15:11.820 --> 06:15:12.830 align:start position:0%
hours but we talked about this at Great
length

06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
length
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and we chose not to take an issue
 
06:15:16.430 --> 06:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
aside on it because we're certainly
 
06:15:18.170 --> 06:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
worried about the chemical traces that
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
are showing up in the Predators and we
 
06:15:22.128 --> 06:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
understand the difficulties of
 
06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
controlling the agricultural pests and
 
06:15:25.730 --> 06:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
health and safety pests and we went back
 
06:15:27.288 --> 06:15:27.298 align:start position:0%
and forth on it and decided the division
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
of pesticides is on a working group with
 
06:15:32.510 --> 06:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
it already and EPA is working on it so
 
06:15:34.070 --> 06:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
we'd like to kind of ride it out and see
 
06:15:36.770 --> 06:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
how it goes before we come back to it
 
06:15:39.650 --> 06:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
this study from fish and game I'm quite
 
06:15:41.270 --> 06:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with it
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um the and I apologize Madam chair for
 
06:15:44.990 --> 06:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
laughing out loud when you asked about
 
06:15:47.570 --> 06:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
Predator populations because there is a
 
06:15:48.890 --> 06:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
special interest group in this state
 
06:15:50.810 --> 06:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
that feels like the foxes are dying off
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
because the Trappers are over trapping
 
06:15:55.128 --> 06:15:55.138 align:start position:0%
them and we have a reduction in Trappers
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
we've had a poor fur trade and so that
 
06:16:01.128 --> 06:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
study was actually because there was a
 
06:16:04.730 --> 06:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
good information that there was a
 
06:16:07.490 --> 06:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
a strain of distemper going through the
 
06:16:10.128 --> 06:16:10.138 align:start position:0%
fox population so an individual raised
 
06:16:13.250 --> 06:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
money and the lab at UNH was excited
 
06:16:14.570 --> 06:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
about having samples and they were
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
testing for a whole bunch of stuff and
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
so this these traces of uh
 
06:16:21.110 --> 06:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
anticoagulants came up kind of as a
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
sidebar and wasn't really part of the
 
06:16:25.970 --> 06:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
study they were looking at distemper uh
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
and and that in the prevalence of it in
 
06:16:30.470 --> 06:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
Fisher gray fox and red fox and I
 
06:16:31.970 --> 06:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
actually contributed a few animals to
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
that study because I'm a chopper so um
 
06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the background on it it
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
was kind of a side thing that came up
 
06:16:40.190 --> 06:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know if fishing game was
 
06:16:42.530 --> 06:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
officially doing a study it's just that
 
06:16:43.970 --> 06:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
they're by their biologists had a
 
06:16:47.208 --> 06:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
relationship with UNH lab and so um
 
06:16:48.830 --> 06:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know and as science goes it was a
 
06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
one-off you know they you know science
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
likes to repeat things so it wasn't like
 
06:16:53.868 --> 06:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
a formal paper it was just a summation
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in that article that was
 
06:16:58.070 --> 06:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
provided they found Trace Amounts with
 
06:17:01.010 --> 06:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
no continued research as to whether or
 
06:17:02.810 --> 06:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
not it had anything to do with fecundity
 
06:17:04.490 --> 06:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
or reproductive Behavior or anything
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
like that so so that was the background
 
06:17:08.750 --> 06:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
on and that may be why it did not get
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
transferred over the pesticide board
 
06:17:13.128 --> 06:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
so that's the background I have for that
 
06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions
 
06:17:18.170 --> 06:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for that everybody else
 
06:17:23.090 --> 06:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
in passing on the foxes being so many
 
06:17:25.850 --> 06:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
Fox there's a lot of foxes and with all
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
my sister owns a feed and grain store
 
06:17:31.128 --> 06:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
and during coven she got sold out of all
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
the chicken feed the bird feeders I
 
06:17:34.670 --> 06:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
think during covid we had a lot more
 
06:17:37.190 --> 06:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
bird feeders come along and our transfer
 
06:17:38.690 --> 06:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
stations are under staff I think there's
 
06:17:40.670 --> 06:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
a reason we have a lot of rats and I
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know what's because we
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't know so just as a question I had
 
06:17:46.010 --> 06:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
asked earlier
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
um have you found that there's a decline
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the Predator population yeah I I
 
06:17:52.190 --> 06:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
personally have not seen that the way
 
06:17:55.368 --> 06:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
that the state tracks It Is by Fox is by
 
06:17:58.430 --> 06:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
fur reports provided by fur Trappers and
 
06:17:59.868 --> 06:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
the number of fur Trappers have gone
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
down significantly in the age of fur
 
06:18:04.010 --> 06:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
Trappers you've got the elderly guys
 
06:18:05.690 --> 06:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
that do it a little bit and you've got a
 
06:18:07.010 --> 06:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
lot of young guys that aren't as
 
06:18:08.750 --> 06:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
experience there's a lot of things in
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
Dynamics while that why that curve looks
 
06:18:13.970 --> 06:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
the way it looks so the special interest
 
06:18:16.548 --> 06:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
groups wants to stop stop trapping foxes
 
06:18:18.770 --> 06:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
but we see them all around our houses
 
06:18:20.990 --> 06:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
we've got bird feeders we've got
 
06:18:23.150 --> 06:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
chickens I mean they're everywhere but
 
06:18:24.530 --> 06:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
the Trapper's not chasing them like they
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
used to and that's so that that's a
 
06:18:27.948 --> 06:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
statement separate from the commission I
 
06:18:30.530 --> 06:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
mean that's my own kind of experience so
 
06:18:33.048 --> 06:18:33.058 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you appreciate it any
 
06:18:38.810 --> 06:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you my name
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:18:46.010 --> 06:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
there is data proving that our predators
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
are declining and I can get you that
 
06:18:52.190 --> 06:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
data if you would like that yes okay
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
and it's it's from the Trapper it's like
 
06:18:56.208 --> 06:18:56.218 align:start position:0%
that man over there and it's Trapper
 
06:18:57.530 --> 06:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
data that
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
predators are declining just because
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a lot of foxes that's just
 
06:19:04.670 --> 06:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
antidotal that that isn't proven that
 
06:19:07.190 --> 06:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's not science see in a fox is not
 
06:19:07.200 --> 06:19:08.448 align:start position:0%
that's not science see in a fox is not
science

06:19:08.448 --> 06:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
science
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
and we do have that scientific
 
06:19:11.590 --> 06:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
information that I will send you okay
 
06:19:14.330 --> 06:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am um
 
06:19:16.128 --> 06:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
the other thing I just wanted to say
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
were a couple of things but let's not
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
wait too long we waited too long with
 
06:19:24.350 --> 06:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
gdt we almost lost our Eagles because of
 
06:19:24.360 --> 06:19:25.970 align:start position:0%
gdt we almost lost our Eagles because of
ddg

06:19:25.970 --> 06:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
ddg
 
06:19:29.930 --> 06:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
so let's you know let's do this now
 
06:19:29.940 --> 06:19:31.070 align:start position:0%
so let's you know let's do this now
like

06:19:31.070 --> 06:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
um you said let's err on the side of
 
06:19:35.330 --> 06:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
caution please
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
and um my story is I get mice all the
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
time I've lived in Bremen New Hampshire
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
for 40 years I have an old house so I do
 
06:19:45.770 --> 06:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
get uh mice and of course I will will
 
06:19:47.930 --> 06:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
not use poisons but the one year I did
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
not get mice was the year I had a weasel
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
now if I had poisons in my house those
 
06:19:54.650 --> 06:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
poisons would have killed that weasel
 
06:19:57.048 --> 06:19:57.058 align:start position:0%
and then I still would have the mice
 
06:20:00.410 --> 06:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
so that's the Predator is the best
 
06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
population controller of mice and rats
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
not poisons
 
06:20:11.208 --> 06:20:11.218 align:start position:0%
and I have I also I just got chickens
 
06:20:13.548 --> 06:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
but you know so I don't want any weasels
 
06:20:13.558 --> 06:20:14.770 align:start position:0%
but you know so I don't want any weasels
anymore

06:20:14.770 --> 06:20:14.780 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:20:17.868 --> 06:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
I feel you I just lost two of myself
 
06:20:21.170 --> 06:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so um but the thing the thing is I
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
want to use poisons either you know I
 
06:20:24.650 --> 06:20:24.660 align:start position:0%

and committee thank you uh for hearing
 
06:20:51.410 --> 06:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
all of this today my name is Jeff
 
06:20:53.990 --> 06:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
Traynor I am a pest control business
 
06:20:55.850 --> 06:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
owner from the southern portion of the
 
06:20:57.350 --> 06:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
state I reside in the town of Mount
 
06:20:57.360 --> 06:20:58.910 align:start position:0%
state I reside in the town of Mount
Vernon

06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
Vernon
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
um I've already submitted written
 
06:21:03.048 --> 06:21:03.058 align:start position:0%
testimony to you guys uh I believe
 
06:21:04.910 --> 06:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday so I'll keep my points brief
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure everyone wants to get
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
out of here I wasn't even going to
 
06:21:09.830 --> 06:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
testify but I just wanted to round some
 
06:21:11.390 --> 06:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
things out that I've heard while sitting
 
06:21:13.970 --> 06:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
here today when I first heard this
 
06:21:16.310 --> 06:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislation was coming the first thing
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
that came to mind after 20 years of
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
doing rodent control was do you want
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
typhus because this is a good way to get
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
typhus we need to control our rodent
 
06:21:27.530 --> 06:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
populations I have a very unique
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
position here because in addition to
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
being a pest control professional I've
 
06:21:35.750 --> 06:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
also worked voluntarily as a citizen
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
06:21:39.230 --> 06:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
department as a Trapper procuring and
 
06:21:42.170 --> 06:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
submitting carcasses from some of those
 
06:21:42.180 --> 06:21:43.310 align:start position:0%
submitting carcasses from some of those
animals

06:21:43.310 --> 06:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
animals
 
06:21:46.010 --> 06:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
um that subsequently tested for these
 
06:21:48.170 --> 06:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
materials now again I could get into the
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of Road and control and the
 
06:21:51.288 --> 06:21:51.298 align:start position:0%
importance of it but I just wanted to
 
06:21:53.750 --> 06:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
emphasize that one of my first rat calls
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
was about 20 minutes from this building
 
06:22:00.650 --> 06:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
and it was such an impactful infestation
 
06:22:03.650 --> 06:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
that the rats were actually nesting in a
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
baby crib mattress while the child was
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
sleeping there oh dear and again my my
 
06:22:12.048 --> 06:22:12.058 align:start position:0%
position in my job is not Glamorous by
 
06:22:15.048 --> 06:22:15.058 align:start position:0%
any means there's no joy in doing Pest
 
06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
Control it's it pays the bills but it's
 
06:22:20.150 --> 06:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
certainly not the most glamorous uh job
 
06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
but the point I want to make with
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
bringing that example up is uh the
 
06:22:26.570 --> 06:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
individual that lived in that house was
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
attempting non-poison attempts for
 
06:22:31.970 --> 06:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
months and months before it got to that
 
06:22:34.430 --> 06:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
point where the state actually had to
 
06:22:36.230 --> 06:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
come in and mandate that they get some
 
06:22:37.610 --> 06:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
kind of professional Pest Control to
 
06:22:39.410 --> 06:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
deal with the situation
 
06:22:42.770 --> 06:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh chemical use is important when
 
06:22:45.530 --> 06:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
properly regulated and I just wanted to
 
06:22:47.570 --> 06:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
emphasize today with all of you with
 
06:22:48.770 --> 06:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
everything that you've heard from both
 
06:22:51.230 --> 06:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
sides I think anyone who supports this
 
06:22:53.690 --> 06:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill is coming with absolute good
 
06:22:55.730 --> 06:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
intentions we can't have chemicals
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
getting into our environment it's very
 
06:22:58.730 --> 06:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
important to keep our environment
 
06:23:02.330 --> 06:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
pristine and clean but we also have to
 
06:23:04.730 --> 06:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
not rush to judgment and sacrifice the
 
06:23:06.650 --> 06:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
importance of Public Health for
 
06:23:09.070 --> 06:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves in addition to our environment
 
06:23:11.570 --> 06:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think an incredibly good compromise
 
06:23:13.010 --> 06:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
that has been brought up here today
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be an amendment to this bill to
 
06:23:17.690 --> 06:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
remove second generation anticoagulants
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
from the hands of the layperson who does
 
06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
not know how to use them all of you can
 
06:23:24.410 --> 06:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
pull up your smartphones right now jump
 
06:23:27.410 --> 06:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
on Amazon and order a five gallon pail
 
06:23:30.410 --> 06:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
of brotifycume you don't need a license
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
to do it you don't need a license to
 
06:23:34.010 --> 06:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
apply it you don't need any kind of
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Regulation from the state as long as
 
06:23:37.128 --> 06:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
you've got money in your bank account
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
you can buy as much as you want and you
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
can distribute it on your property
 
06:23:43.310 --> 06:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
however you see fit whether it's in
 
06:23:44.890 --> 06:23:44.900 align:start position:0%
accordance with the label or not
 
06:23:48.410 --> 06:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
meanwhile I myself am required to have
 
06:23:50.810 --> 06:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
continued education to ensure that I'm
 
06:23:53.090 --> 06:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
using these materials properly there are
 
06:23:55.548 --> 06:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
agents from the pesticide board that are
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
actively out looking for lettered
 
06:23:59.570 --> 06:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
Vehicles pest control companies to
 
06:24:00.650 --> 06:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're following
 
06:24:02.750 --> 06:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
regulations we are required to follow
 
06:24:04.610 --> 06:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
label directions when using these
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
materials we are using these materials
 
06:24:08.990 --> 06:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
in a locked bait station some are metal
 
06:24:11.750 --> 06:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
some are plastic the bait blocks are
 
06:24:14.090 --> 06:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
placed on rods inside of these bait
 
06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
stations to ensure that other animals
 
06:24:17.628 --> 06:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
such as raccoons and other creatures
 
06:24:20.030 --> 06:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't pull them out so essentially it's
 
06:24:21.890 --> 06:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
rodents and rodent-sized animals that
 
06:24:23.390 --> 06:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
are accessing them
 
06:24:25.510 --> 06:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
so the point I'm trying to make is that
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
the licensed applicator in the state of
 
06:24:30.048 --> 06:24:30.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is already heavily
 
06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
regulated we're not out there winging
 
06:24:34.190 --> 06:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
blocks bait around to just kill whatever
 
06:24:35.990 --> 06:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
we can kill we're here for a public
 
06:24:38.090 --> 06:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
health situation to address rodents
 
06:24:38.100 --> 06:24:39.708 align:start position:0%
health situation to address rodents
accordingly

06:24:39.708 --> 06:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
06:24:41.570 --> 06:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and I would just hope that there's
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
some Credence given to that aspect for
 
06:24:45.350 --> 06:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who may be on the fence with
 
06:24:48.048 --> 06:24:48.058 align:start position:0%
wanting to proceed with moving this bill
 
06:24:50.090 --> 06:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
along and as it's currently written I
 
06:24:52.310 --> 06:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
would I would implore you all to put a
 
06:24:56.030 --> 06:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
contingency in there to exempt licensed
 
06:24:59.030 --> 06:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
applicators from this ban but I do feel
 
06:25:01.250 --> 06:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
strongly personally that something has
 
06:25:04.970 --> 06:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
to be done about the immense access to
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
the layperson unregulated to all of
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
these chemicals not just second gen's uh
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll wrap it up there thank you sir
 
06:25:16.250 --> 06:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony at all did
 
06:25:18.410 --> 06:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
you send any in I did I submitted uh
 
06:25:20.990 --> 06:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony via email uh I believe
 
06:25:23.390 --> 06:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
to your email uh Vice chair as well as
 
06:25:25.250 --> 06:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh the committee I believe yesterday or
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
Sunday evening thank you that's helpful
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr trainer
 
06:25:33.650 --> 06:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative Potenza
 
06:25:35.930 --> 06:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
um first comment I just I really
 
06:25:38.330 --> 06:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony I think it was
 
06:25:40.430 --> 06:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
um exactly kind of what I've been
 
06:25:41.930 --> 06:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bait boxes
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
is there a way that those animals that
 
06:25:53.510 --> 06:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
are you know they eat and they're off is
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
there a is there some other way to keep
 
06:25:58.128 --> 06:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
them so they're not because that's
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
really the problem right is because
 
06:26:02.330 --> 06:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's when an owl or another Predator
 
06:26:04.610 --> 06:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
is going to Hawk whatever now they're
 
06:26:06.770 --> 06:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
just going to take them so
 
06:26:08.570 --> 06:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
06:26:10.128 --> 06:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this will answer your
 
06:26:11.690 --> 06:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
question or not but I'll see
 
06:26:14.628 --> 06:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
um there are regulations on the label as
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
to how much we can put
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
in each one of those bait boxes for
 
06:26:21.770 --> 06:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
example if I'm controlling mice all of
 
06:26:24.230 --> 06:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
these rodenticides go by body weight so
 
06:26:26.750 --> 06:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
if I am there to address a mouse issue
 
06:26:30.288 --> 06:26:30.298 align:start position:0%
I'm using far less bait than I would for
 
06:26:31.810 --> 06:26:31.820 align:start position:0%
say a rat
 
06:26:35.810 --> 06:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
in that regard so I would say that we're
 
06:26:38.690 --> 06:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
mandated professionally to limit the
 
06:26:40.610 --> 06:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
amounts that we are putting out each one
 
06:26:42.650 --> 06:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
of those bait boxes have to be placed a
 
06:26:44.990 --> 06:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
certain distance apart per EPA and
 
06:26:48.470 --> 06:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
manufacture regulations so I I would say
 
06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we are reducing the odds I I can
 
06:26:52.670 --> 06:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
never tell you that it can't happen it
 
06:26:55.190 --> 06:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
can it clearly is but the point being
 
06:26:56.810 --> 06:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
that in a professional standpoint
 
06:26:59.270 --> 06:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's far more regulation on how we
 
06:27:02.208 --> 06:27:02.218 align:start position:0%
are Distributing that material and where
 
06:27:04.010 --> 06:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's ending up as opposed to someone
 
06:27:05.810 --> 06:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
that can buy the same exact bucket that
 
06:27:08.810 --> 06:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
sits on my truck and let's face it I'm a
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
dad first thing I do when I get a new
 
06:27:12.708 --> 06:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
stereo is throw away the the directions
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
and do it myself I'm not reading
 
06:27:18.048 --> 06:27:18.058 align:start position:0%
instructions it's fine for a stereo not
 
06:27:20.690 --> 06:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
so great for hazardous chemicals and the
 
06:27:22.610 --> 06:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
fact that these things are just readily
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
available to the public who has no
 
06:27:27.288 --> 06:27:27.298 align:start position:0%
experience or no regard unbeknownst to
 
06:27:27.298 --> 06:27:28.190 align:start position:0%
experience or no regard unbeknownst to
them

06:27:28.190 --> 06:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:27:31.010 --> 06:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I think is is the bigger concern so I
 
06:27:32.330 --> 06:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
guess to answer your question we're
 
06:27:34.190 --> 06:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
regulated in how we're putting that
 
06:27:36.610 --> 06:27:36.620 align:start position:0%
stuff out to minimum demise
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
the odds of that material getting out
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
additionally my company we mandate uh
 
06:27:42.890 --> 06:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
with all my technicians and myself
 
06:27:45.948 --> 06:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
carcass cleanup so when we go back to a
 
06:27:48.288 --> 06:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
rad infestation if we find signs of of
 
06:27:50.628 --> 06:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
of dead animals or we visually see dead
 
06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
animals we are picking them up and
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
disposing them accordingly in a bucket
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
and then in a dumpster so that we don't
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
have any contamination issues
 
06:28:00.770 --> 06:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:28:02.810 --> 06:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
06:28:05.270 --> 06:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
06:28:08.930 --> 06:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon anyone else
 
06:28:12.470 --> 06:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay I think that we have
 
06:28:16.010 --> 06:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
talked this enough today
 
06:28:18.410 --> 06:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
I appreciate everybody's time and
 
06:28:21.530 --> 06:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
attention and I will call this hearing
 
06:28:21.540 --> 06:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
