the chair uh this is
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
a session on the uh HR 209 and I would
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
like to open
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
when you first heard this bill over here
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
electronic relative electronic weight

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of conversation whether or
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
not we felt uh
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
sorry we had a lot of discussion whether
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
or not we felt this should be mandated I
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
tell you that the personal issue I have
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
with these cards is while I may be
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
accused of being an old man and liking
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
the old way we did things versus
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
technology I remember my uh our clerk
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
John Mackey he'd like to check and
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's what our law says if you want to
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
check you can get a check and I
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
understand employers are trying to be
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
more efficient they're not doing their
 
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
own payrolls in a lot of respects
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're hiring payroll companies and the
 
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
payroll companies it's more costly for
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
them to issue checks and send them along
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
so they've gotten into these these cards
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I have no problem the cards the
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
problem I have with the cards is the
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
fees I really do you know the the one
 
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
thing you all remember your first job I
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember my first job I was a landscaper
 
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
you know made uh 450 an hour in high
 
00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
you know made uh 450 an hour in high
school

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
we we had a place where we could go and
 
00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
cash our checks
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
but if I had to pay a dollar every time
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
I wanted to use a debit card or two
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
dollars uh
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
every dollar counts
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
and for some a dollar a transaction or
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
two bucks a month or or something
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
and then you say well you can take that
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
card and for one for no fee
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
take it all out and cash it
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
well I guess you can do that uh I just
 
00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099 align:start position:0%
don't like if we're not going to mandate
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
my buddy uh Mike Cahill we we have had
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
discussions all summer I enjoy emailing
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
with Mike and
 
00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:05.089 align:start position:0%
with Mike and
um

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's certain things that we or I
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
don't like to mandate on businesses
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's what makes New Hampshire
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
different from a lot of things we don't
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
mandate on businesses what to do and we
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
try not to mandate employees having to
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
do things and I just unless you can come
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
up with a better mousetrap the way this
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
one was explained to us and the fees
 
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
associated with it no disrespect to a
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
company wanting to make business and
 
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.490 align:start position:0%
company wanting to make business and
capital

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh you know Capital way of doing
 
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.750 align:start position:0%
um uh you know Capital way of doing
business

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I I uh capitalism I just I think they
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
make a lot of money off fees and I'm
 
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
just not a real fan
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um I think even
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
um outside of the
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
um preference issue
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the big issues I see with the
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
pay cards is the insecurity of the
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
reliability of the payment
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
um if you have one of the pay cards
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
um odds are it's through a third party
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
of a third party
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and the actual process of
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
um getting their attention if your
 
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
payment is short late
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
um untraceable is far more complicated
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
than just uh reaching out to your
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
employer and asking for the issuance of
 
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
a second check
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
um I that that is terrifying
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
um if you are a person who like the
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
majority of people live paycheck to
 
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.250 align:start position:0%
majority of people live paycheck to
paycheck

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and you have an unexpected turn in
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
the unavailability of the money that
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
you've earned then that can create other
 
00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.769 align:start position:0%
you've earned then that can create other
problems

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
um as much as I would love to see pay
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
cards go entirely I would be content
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
with just uh not mandating it at this
 
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.570 align:start position:0%
with just uh not mandating it at this
time

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth is
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman I'd
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
like to take the Devil's Advocate
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
position for a moment here
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
um and jostling my memory for what we
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
talked about uh back in the spring
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
first of all if my recollection serves
 
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.570 align:start position:0%
first of all if my recollection serves
me

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
this is part of the bigger picture where
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
the what we're talking about is a what
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
the the law basically says what are
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable payments
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
and then secondly what is the order of
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
preference and if I remember the first
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
preference is the direct deposit if if
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
the employee has a bank account
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
and wants direct deposit the employer
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
must offer that so what we're talking
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
about here is what is the fallback
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
position and that fallback position is
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
if you either don't have a bank
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
or you don't want to use it for some
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
reason in a direct deposit capacity what
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
must the employer do if the employee
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
requests it the answer now and has been
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
for some time a check this law would
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
change that to make the default position
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
a pay card but again remembering that it
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
is if the employer likes a check and the
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
employee likes a check you could still
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
go that way it's just if there's a
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
disagreement what is the fallback
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
position so I wanted to make that clear
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
in everybody's mind as we're discussing
 
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.230 align:start position:0%
in everybody's mind as we're discussing
this

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
um the second thing that I recall is
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the fees in
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the discussion in the spring
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
we were assured that those fees don't
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
apply in the cases that we're talking
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
about that no employee should have to
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
pay fees to get their their paycheck and
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's only kind of extra stuff that might
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
incur fees and we as a committee we were
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
a little uncomfortable with that I don't
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
think we like taking some one bank's
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
assurance that this is the way it's
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
going to work when that protection's not
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
in law so that seemed to be a sticking
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
point but it's it's not entirely clear
 
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
to me what the full answer is on that so
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
having said all that is kind of a
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question to the committee
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
is there a solution to this
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
and because that's what we're here to
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
talk about today is If there is a better
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that might be
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
acceptable then I would vote to
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
if on the other hand the answer is you
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
know what this is just all wrong then I
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
I understand that as well but I wanted
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
to offer that as as uh
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
framework for our discussion here today
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair
 
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:14.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
I I believe the
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
um representative seaworth is uh correct
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
in most of what he's saying but just to
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
clarify this bill would make it so that
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
the paper checks were no longer required
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
any employer who did not want to do
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
paper checks anymore could say I won't
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
do them and that fall back then would be
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
the um the payroll cards and the problem
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
with what we were told was that
 
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.290 align:start position:0%
with what we were told was that
um

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
each pay period
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
every employee would get one withdrawal
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
from that payroll card without charge
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that assumes that they are going to
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
go to the bank and take all of their
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
money out or as much money as they feel
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to use during that pay
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
period and um
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
take it from the card to avoid fees the
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
problem is that the people that who are
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
probably going to get stuck with the
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
payroll cards because they don't have a
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
bank or you know because they're living
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
in Dire Straits of some form they're not
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
the most sophisticated people in the
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
world and basically they would probably
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
be delighted to have a debit card that
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
they could use on a regular basis to you
 
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.250 align:start position:0%
they could use on a regular basis to you
know

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:24.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
buy a bag of chips or you know fill up
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
the tank or whatever and those
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
additional transactions are where the
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
additional fees come in so that I
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
believe is the objection that some of us
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
have to to the cards so
 
00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:41.949 align:start position:0%
have to to the cards so
um

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh I think I do know what the solution
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
is the solution is um you know to leave
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
it alone I have no problem if the
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
payroll cards are available to an
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
employer an employee who both think that
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
they're desirable
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
um or think the fees are acceptable
 
00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:00.110 align:start position:0%
um or think the fees are acceptable
um

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
but I think the current law says You
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
must provide a paper check if that's
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
what an employee asks for should stay in
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
place so I would suggest that no
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
additional legislation is necessary
 
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.650 align:start position:0%
additional legislation is necessary
thanks

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh I also believe that
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um representative seaworth's
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
recollection is correct as far as
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
the belief among the financial
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
institutions that testified that
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
employees would have access to uh one
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
full out cash withdrawal
 
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.810 align:start position:0%
full out cash withdrawal
um

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
I guess the thing that I wonder is
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
would that be a thing that goes into
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
statute and would that statute be
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
constitutional because you can take the
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
um promise from the financial
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
institutions that the employees would
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
have access to that one withdrawal I
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
don't I wouldn't bet anything on that
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
but um point with standing
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
um I would be interested to see how the
 
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.150 align:start position:0%
um I would be interested to see how the
um

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
like if you have a company that's based
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
out in California or Oregon or in a
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
different state that's New Hampshire
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and how would the
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
um legality of an enforcement of a one
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
withdrawal without fee hold up in the
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
wake of the Wayfarer decision a few
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
years ago I don't know
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
um that would be a gamble that I would
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
not want to take so I would concur
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
um on not moving legislation forward on
 
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
um on not moving legislation forward on
that

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
a chair rep recognizes uh representative
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
Seifert thank you Mr chairman and I want
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
to answer that to the best of my ability
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
because I think we did look at a similar
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
issue in this bill and the answer from
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor on that similar
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
issue was that their enforcement ends
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
with the employer
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so if an out-of-state Bank was not
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
living up to the legal obligations in
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
providing that pay card our department
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
of labor would go after the employer
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
for providing their employees with a
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
non-compliant pay card because you are
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
correct they can't regulate a bank that
 
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
infanting thank you Mr chair I think you
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that I've watched
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years is as I've gone
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
from you know you had to make remember
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
guys some of you older folks you had to
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
get to the bank by five o'clock on
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
Friday to have cash
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
all not you
 
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.510 align:start position:0%
all not you
people

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
some of us are white-haired people here
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
remember you had to get to the bank by
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
Friday at five for money for the weekend
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't if you ran out of
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
money for the weekend cash and and you
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put on a credit card if
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
you're lucky you had a little uh card at
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
the grocery store where you could get
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
like a 50 you could cash a check at the
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
local grocery store because they had
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
already you know they already signed up
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
with them and then when these uh
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
bank cards showed up they were just
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
you could make a deposit or get cash
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
there was no what you could do with it
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
now so you know at almost 60 years of
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
age I've seen all this thing happen and
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
we try to push things and you know
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just happen by themselves
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many people out there
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
um our our clerk who is an owner of his
 
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
company and still wants a paycheck every
 
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
company and still wants a paycheck every
uh

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
um week or whatever and gets that
 
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.289 align:start position:0%
um week or whatever and gets that
um

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
how big of a problem is this
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
are there that many people that don't
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
want a a a card are there that many
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
people that don't want direct deposit
 
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:01.220 align:start position:0%
uh out there
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
is it that burden burdensome to
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
employers we didn't hear one employer I
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
believe that I recall come in and say oh
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a major cause for me it's a
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
major problem
 
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.409 align:start position:0%
major problem
um

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and since I am in the insurance
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
business and I see so much Computer
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
Fraud and hacking I've had three claims
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
this year of people getting in and
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
stealing money from people's accounts
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
um Unfortunately they let them in uh
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
computer uh genius over here
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
representative Prout uh probably knows
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
more about some of this nefarious stuff
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
than than I'd like to even know exists
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
I don't know I like to err on this side
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
of caution I'm showing my age here but
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
um uh it would be nice
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
if it worked out
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
where employers could save money it
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
could be more efficient for the employee
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
but again whose problem are we trying to
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
solve here
 
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
usually If This Were big enough I would
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
think the Bia would be coming in here
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
saying guys this is a major problem this
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
is making us non-competitive with the
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
rather other states around us we need to
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
do this as a state to keep up to be able
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
to retain and keep employees and bring
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
them to New Hampshire I didn't hear it
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative just anyone
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
else uh care to be heard on this
 
00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:26.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh representative
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
avelini thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
avelini thank you Mr chairman
um

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
without beating the dead horse if a
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
payroll card is requested by a
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
employee at the under this
 
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.570 align:start position:0%
employee at the under this
um

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the original
 
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.049 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the original
bill

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um there will be a you know roll-up cost
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
to having that card available to the
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
employee in a timely fashion
 
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.990 align:start position:0%
employee in a timely fashion
um

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
losing the card the original Bill had 24
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
hours of being notified so if they lose
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
it on a Saturday they're not going to
 
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
get a car till at least Monday morning
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
so that part is just unworkable in the
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
original bill it was taken out of the
 
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.250 align:start position:0%
original bill it was taken out of the
amendment

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.330 align:start position:0%
amendment
but

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.950 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
we have no definition for a b or c we
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
have definitions for D and E
 
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.409 align:start position:0%
have definitions for D and E
um

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
I think a b and c work very well
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
payroll cards again I think we only
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
heard from a payable company about
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
payroll cards
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and the checks again smaller
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
employers don't have Sometimes some
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
don't have access to or can't afford
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
larger payroll companies and use a
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
smaller company or even their accountant
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do their payroll at least where I'm
 
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.029 align:start position:0%
to do their payroll at least where I'm
from

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
so most of them do
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
direct deposit or checks having payroll
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
cards you know again we have One Bank in
 
00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.330 align:start position:0%
cards you know again we have One Bank in
town

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not the bank that everybody
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
uses in town so would that be convenient
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the people that work for you
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't have Banks
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult to have that
 
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.710 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult to have that
accessibility

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
with the cards and then you know the
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
same thing with the checks so I I think
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
leaving well enough alone
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
um going forward would be in our best
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
interest unless we have like
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew time said a call
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
to move to payroll cards as a permanent
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
solution to checks but we haven't heard
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
that yet thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh chair represent recognizes
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Prout
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so kind of how I
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
see this bill is all about changing what
 
00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:44.690 align:start position:0%
see this bill is all about changing what
the

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh Position will be if the employee and
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
the employer can't come to an otherwise
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
um and currently the the fallback
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
position is a check and this would
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
change the fallback position to
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the payroll card
 
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.850 align:start position:0%
uh the payroll card
um

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to to keep in
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
mind that we're talking about what
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
happens when they actively disagree
 
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.710 align:start position:0%
happens when they actively disagree
um

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
something else that's in our current
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
laws that essentially if the employee
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't see the preference at all then
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the fallback position is also a check
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'd be much more okay with changing the
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
default if nobody expresses an opinion
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
to a payroll call card
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
but changing the default when there's an
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
active disagreement
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
from uh from a check to a payroll card I
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot bigger qualm about because
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
there might be reasons that the employee
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
actively dislikes the payroll card
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so changing the default of the
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
employer if the employee says nothing
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'd be fairly okay with but changing the
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
default when there's an active
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
disagreement I think is something that
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I just want to
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
remind all of us that the the real
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
default is the direct deposit that's
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
what almost everybody does
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
um I like direct deposit I think most of
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
us given that option would choose direct
 
00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.529 align:start position:0%
us given that option would choose direct
deposit

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
deposit
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
um what we're dealing with are the
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
outliers the few people who um either
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
will not or cannot do direct deposit
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
most of them are people without bank
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
accounts so this is a small number of
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
people who will either get a check or
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
will get a payroll card
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
and in either case it's a very very
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
small number because the vast majority
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
of folks in New Hampshire are very happy
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
with direct deposit it's incredibly
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
convenient there's no worries about five
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the bank or fees or anything
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
else the money just shows up and you
 
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
start spinning it as soon as it's there
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
um so um you know I I just uh I think
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that much of an
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to require an employer to
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
provide a check
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
um to a very few people who simply are
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
unable to do the
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
direct deposit or you know we still have
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
situations I remember I think during the
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
hearing I referred to the people who
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't do
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
um direct deposits as dinosaurs
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
um I was approached by one of our
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues after the hearing with a
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
smile on his face but he says I guess
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a dinosaur
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
um but at any rate it's a very small
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
number of checks or a very small number
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
of payroll cards
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
um you'll never have a fee well you
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
could have a fee but basically you have
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
to be able to cash that check without a
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
fee and I
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
the payroll cards can very well turn
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
into fees for people who can't afford it
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
um better to do nothing than to do
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
do any other Representatives want to be

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
our second and final bill has to do with
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 377 FN relative to the
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of post-traumatic stress
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.250 align:start position:0%
yes yes
this

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
darn it I didn't uh bring the right page
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
I didn't believe this had to do with the
 
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
I didn't believe this had to do with the
the

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:05.420 align:start position:0%
um the workers compensation to and from
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry I don't have the amendment
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
with me I apologize that was the
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
original bill so um I will open that uh
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
the open this
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
um interim study
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
hearing to anyone who would like to
 
00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:21.410 align:start position:0%
hearing to anyone who would like to
opine

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
opine
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
okay representative attitude
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan remember m c
 
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan remember m c
worth

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman can we start off with a
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
motion and then move to discussion after
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
I don't mind is there any objection to
 
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.069 align:start position:0%
I don't mind is there any objection to
that

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh you're
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
right you're welcome to make a motion I
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
would move to consider future
 
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.170 align:start position:0%
would move to consider future
legislation

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
um and if I could briefly speak to that
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
motion yes you may
 
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused now
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
um because of the new title and the lack
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
of the amendment I think the underlying
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
bill has a good point
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and because it's essentially
 
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.810 align:start position:0%
um and because it's essentially
non-binding

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
non-binding
 
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.530 align:start position:0%
non-binding
um

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
I think it could use more consideration
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
after but I don't
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused as what we're
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
talking about now
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
um so I suppose that's where I would be
 
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:16.820 align:start position:0%
at on it observe Sullivan
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with the chair I'd like to
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
take a minute to try to review exactly
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about so we can
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
actually know what we're talking about
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and my recollection is that this bill
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
was dealing with state troopers who
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
um were in uniform
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
in their patrol car and moving to and
 
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.310 align:start position:0%
in their patrol car and moving to and
from

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
workplaces such as a construction zone
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
where they were technically not on duty
 
00:38:49.089 --> 00:38:49.099 align:start position:0%
um and the The
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
Fairly convoluted situation I found it
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
interesting to learn about but basically
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
it meant that if
 
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.010 align:start position:0%
it meant that if
um

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
if they ended up in a workers comp
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
situation an injury on their way to this
 
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:05.900 align:start position:0%
work site
 
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:09.740 align:start position:0%
they witnessed some sort of lawlessness
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
they as is appropriate they act on it
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
and somehow end up becoming injured
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
dealing with a Law Enforcement issue on
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
the way to a
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
they want to be considered on duty and
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
therefore or at least they want workers
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
comp to cover them even though they're
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
not on duty I guess is the way it worked
 
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
not on duty I guess is the way it worked
and

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
as I recollect some members of the
 
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.530 align:start position:0%
as I recollect some members of the
committee

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:44.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
upon reviewing this thought that perhaps
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
there might be other members of law
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement that may also benefit from
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh type of provision and I believe that
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
is how it ended up
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
um as a interim study bill and you know
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
the the question before us is whether or
 
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
the the question before us is whether or
not

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
um any um for the legislation ought to
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
be suggested
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I also recall discussion during the
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the hearing of
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
um whether or not there is any pressing
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
need expressed from
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
the patrol officers and um it there
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of testimony to that effect
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I believe their organization was
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
came forward but there was not a lot of
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
other others so
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
and if somebody has a clear or a
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
different recollection I'd be delighted
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
to have it clarified but um hopefully
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
that that's helpful
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
I believe your recollection is sound
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative representative uh
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I too will
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
agree uh representative Sullivan's
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
recollection matches my own and I think
 
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:01.700 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
yes it there was some question on the
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
committee does this bill not go far
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
enough was it too narrow in its scope
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
or maybe even was it unnecessary is it
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
something that workers comp already
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
would do and isn't necessary in law and
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
the hold up as I recall was that we
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get that kind of information that
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
um at least some of us thought was
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
necessary to being able to act on the
 
00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:31.370 align:start position:0%
necessary to being able to act on the
bill

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
I also would agree with my colleagues
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
that it would be appropriate to resubmit
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
this bill and to get that extra detail
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be absent this time
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
around and I think we could
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
we could work with it in a future
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
session thank you thank you
 
00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
session thank you thank you
representative

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
um my recollection mostly matches uh
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
what has been said already
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and I recall that my big concern was
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
the extreme specificity of the language
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
before us to a certain set of
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we could clearly
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
identify circumstances very similar but
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
just outside the wording
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't understand didn't
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
understand why they were excluded
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
um for example if two officers are going
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
to a construction site together one in
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
the Opera driver's seat of the vehicle
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
one the passenger seat the driver's
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
covered but the passenger is not
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
under the wording we had before us uh
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
similarly if the officer you know
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
stopped to do something and the car was
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
off he was standing right at the
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
driver's door he wasn't operating the
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle it wouldn't be covered there
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
were so many
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
the language was so specific to a
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
certain set of circumstances we didn't
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand if there was a reason driving
 
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.730 align:start position:0%
understand if there was a reason driving
that

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
or if it was just the by happenstance
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
those words were chosen and we didn't
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
have any testify any testimony to
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
clarify any of that confusion or
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
questions that we had and so that's why
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
we placed it in term study
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
as far as I can recall
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:07.319 --> 00:43:09.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
um there was several questions that
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
remained still remain unanswered one is
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
why this isn't covering
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
um County Sheriffs they take their
 
00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:21.740 align:start position:0%
vehicles home this also doesn't cover
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
local officers that take their vehicles
 
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.790 align:start position:0%
local officers that take their vehicles
home

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
um fishing game fishing game as well uh
 
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshals fire wardens I mean we can
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
go across the the whole Spectrum
 
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.730 align:start position:0%
go across the the whole Spectrum
um

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's one and
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
the the problem I had with it is it
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the diagnosis of
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder and state
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
troopers when it was simply traveling
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
from their house to a off-site job you
 
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
know technically off duty but in a car
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
and in the uniform of the day how does
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
that transfer to a post-traumatic stress
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
disorder and straight Troopers and
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's was also unanswered
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
um if it's just some simple coverage to
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
and from it doesn't seem to be it seems
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be a simple workman's comp but to
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
expand the definition of post-traumatic
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
stress disorder seems to be a little
 
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
more we need a little more on that
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
we heard nothing about post-traumatic
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
stress nothing so I have to believe that
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills that the
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
other body hijacked and repurposed
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so I think we can set the
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress aside
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I agree that there are unanswered
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
questions there are folks that might
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
benefit from it I think at the time my
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
sense was
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
what harm can it do to go ahead and pass
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
this and if other people need to pile on
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
we can expand it in the next session
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.829 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
um

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
but um I I would be supportive of uh you
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
know encouraging the uh
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
involved folks to bring this back answer
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that we've got and
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
give it another go so I I would support
 
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.410 align:start position:0%
give it another go so I I would support
that

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rudy thank you
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this is one of those cases
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
leaves a little at a lower open and the
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have very sharp
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
lawyers and they're not going to want to
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
pay anything they don't have to so I see
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
this an incident happening and it winds
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
up in the Supreme Court because the
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor won't be able to
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
I would encourage us to go next year and
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
do our job
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
there was no Sullivan like you I also
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to see if we can come up
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
with something and I did offer to
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
compromise to
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
um the lobbyist for the Troopers
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
Association they took it back to their
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
members and they were afraid the
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
compromise was narrow when they wanted
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
it broader just for
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
edification of what goes on with workers
 
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.609 align:start position:0%
edification of what goes on with workers
compensation

00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
if you are driving if I am driving to a
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
work site
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where I go to work that day I
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
am not covered under my employer's
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
workers compensation from my home to my
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
work site however if I'm a roving
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent or I leave my office I am
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
going to four different calls or I go to
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
four or five different jobs that is
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
considered on the job
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm not just going to the
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
office to start my day or wherever the
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
wherever the place is I'm not going to
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
the restaurant to start my day
 
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.609 align:start position:0%
the restaurant to start my day
um

00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
um you know that's not covered however
 
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.430 align:start position:0%
um you know that's not covered however
if

00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh my my boss tells me to go pick up
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
four different supplies at food at four
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
different places I am on I am I'm
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
covered so that is kind of the law there
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
was an article I am it's probably
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
sitting on my desk there was a actually
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
a case in New Hampshire that went all
 
00:47:16.609 --> 00:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
the way to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
Court this year
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
um about this there's this whole concept
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Labor and within
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation about this
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
concept of on the way to work when is it
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and um I think that ruling will be
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
important to Future legislation
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
but there's no question that Troopers
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
are driving vehicles and anyone and you
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
know one of the things we had a
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
discussion was well in uniform well
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
uniform is a officer's uniform or an
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
undercover officers and plain clothes so
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the uniform of the day is
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
whatever that is
 
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
whatever that is
um

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
they are going to uh their uh they're
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:56.870 align:start position:0%
going to
um

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
target shoot
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
because they have to do that as
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
requirements they're going to continued
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
education they're going to continue
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
training they're going to a detail when
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
they're leaving their home
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
so her first question is well should
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
they be covered on the weight of those
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
things I my opinion as an insurance guy
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
I think yes they're driving a company
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're on the way to do that as
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
part of their job then the question was
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
well if they happen to see something
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
going where they have to
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's a bad situation going down there
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
a mile away even though they're off duty
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
they call and say hey I'm here I'm going
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
to go or they stop at the side of the
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
road to see a stranded vehicle or a car
 
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
road to see a stranded vehicle or a car
accident

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
accident
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and um they have to engage so when
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
they engage
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's when it should start
 
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.069 align:start position:0%
that's when it should start
um

00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
again all these things get complex
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
and they have to be well defined and
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
um I think the Supreme Court case will
 
00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
um I think the Supreme Court case will
help

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
um that happened this year but uh
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
without question I don't think there's
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
anyone here that does not want a Sheriff
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officer state trooper
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be injured in the line of duty and
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
someone have a technicality and say well
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know you kind of weren't on duty yet
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
you know kind of like yeah I don't think
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
anyone's here to do that that's not the
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way so I'm in agreement
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
with all of my colleagues
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
um that uh would like to see this for
 
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.730 align:start position:0%
um that uh would like to see this for
future

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.950 align:start position:0%
future
legislation

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
so representative adigent moved
 
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation for future legislation
 
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
so if you would like this for future
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislation you would vote Yes if not
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%

committee I've served on and uh I have
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
to say that I've been proud to be a part
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
of all three of those committees they've
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
all been differently made up
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
um the first committee I was on was a
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
republican majority the second one I was
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
uh lucky enough to be chair of the third
 
00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:39.530 align:start position:0%
uh lucky enough to be chair of the third
one

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
um is had chairman infantine is uh the
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
lead in the on the committee and um
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that if
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
by some Stroke of Luck I should be in
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
the position of chairing this committee
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
again I hope I'm able to do chair it as
 
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
effectively and fairly as chairman
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
infantine has I will uh I hope I did it
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
that way when I had the opportunity and
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
I would always keep in mind the manner
