00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
I thought uh someone was will be here
 
00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 align:start position:0%
but at any rate let don't we continue
 
00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
and uh good morning thank you so much uh
 
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
to the committee for uh allowing this
 
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.390 align:start position:0%
to the committee for uh allowing this
time

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
to revisit this bill and and see what we
 
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
can do to make it amenable for um what
 
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm seeking as well as uh the goals for
 
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
Dees um I did receive a uh an email from
 
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolia who said she
 
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't join us today um but she has
 
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
asked for a replace all Amendment which
 
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
is before you um which is very
 
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
simple she apparently spoke at length
 
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
with uh Miss Darlene forest from Dees
 
00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
and concluded that the word remove in
 
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
current statute is confusing and keeping
 
00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
people from proceeding with debris
 
00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
clearing from their streams and at the
 
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
risk of putting words in her mouth even
 
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
um Miss Forest admitted she didn't know
 
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
what remove meant in the
 
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
RSA and she stated again that Dees
 
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have jurisdictional authority
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
over the removal of sticks and debris in
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
culverts and
 
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
streams I looked at this you know if we
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
just took out the word remove from the
 
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0%
just took out the word remove from the
statute

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
I think that gives a lot more leeway to
 
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
a property owner
 
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
to have the statutory authority
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
to remove storm debris
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
from uh a stream that can be causing
 
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
some problems where the stream is being
 
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
diverted to damage their their Gardens
 
00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
their field crops their structures on
 
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
their property animal pens and so forth
 
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that that goes a good way to
 
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
um change statute and then Dees can then
 
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
go and adapt rules to match
 
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
this I would also like to um am amend
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
this simple change even further to add a
 
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.390 align:start position:0%
this simple change even further to add a
sentence

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 align:start position:0%
um because the the RSA
 
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
482a colon
 
00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
3 states no person shall excavate remove
 
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
which is the word we want to take out
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
fill dredge or construct any structures
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
in or on any Bank flat Marsh or swamp in
 
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
and adjacent to any Waters of the state
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
without a permit from the Department so
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
that clearly says that you need some
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
sort of whether it's an emergency permit
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
or a Wetlands permit that you need a
 
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
or a Wetlands permit that you need a
permit

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
to do that kind of work I would like to
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
then add some kind of statement that
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
says removal of storm debris from a
 
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
stream by a property owner is
 
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
permissible and does not require a
 
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
permit to be absolutely
 
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
clear so that's kind of where we are
 
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
with this and the rest of the bill I
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
mean I'd be happy just to scrap the bill
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I submitted originally add this
 
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 align:start position:0%
very small change and I think that that
 
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
would cover it um because the goal of my
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill is basically to allow a property
 
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 align:start position:0%
owner to clear a stream out of debris
 
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
after a storm happens without having to
 
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
jump through enormous numbers of Hoops
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
through the permitting process and
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I am with that so I'd be
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
happy to ask ask answer any questions
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay this is a since this is a
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
a uh work session it's a little more
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
informal it isn't the normal card or
 
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that um so does anyone uh
 
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.430 align:start position:0%
anything like that um so does anyone uh
on

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
on
the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair good
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
morning good morning
 
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
um to to potentially make your um you
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
suggested change um a bit broader to
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
can't handle other cases I wonder if you
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
consider um except as um supported by or
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
except except as defined by emergency
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
removal Provisions uh in rules adopted
 
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.230 align:start position:0%
removal Provisions uh in rules adopted
by

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
Dees and then they could put the rules
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
in that say that they could clear which
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
is what they said they were going to do
 
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
and then it would it wouldn't just be
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
like maybe there's other cases is where
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
they need to account for these emergency
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
procedures not just for not just for
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
storms okay I mean that that would be
 
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
fine too
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the the only issue I have with the
 
00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.909 align:start position:0%
um the the only issue I have with the
emergency

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
procedures is that just along with the
 
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
rules as well as the paperwork it says
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
that if you do any emergency work that
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
you still have to file
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
um the the regular
 
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.189 align:start position:0%
um the the regular
permitting

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
necessary and that says that in in their
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
rules um i' have to find that but
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I I think I had sent a uh
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a copy thank you yeah yeah
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um so we have
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
um the emergency author authorization um
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
3154 and it says you know as well as on
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
their website with the
 
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
directions um that the property owner
 
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know can or or the well I I'm I'm
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
concentrating on property owners I'm not
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
concentrating on um what what a
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
municipality does because
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
clearly I think they're different
 
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.909 align:start position:0%
clearly I think they're different
entities

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
um but it says that with the um with the
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization you still have
 
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:43.710 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization you still have
to

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
paperwork I have to
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
can I point out the piece that I should
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
see yeah sure on um
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
3155 where it's um work done during
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
emergencies without prior
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
authorization so this is the case
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
where um you if if your property is in
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
imminent danger you can stabilize
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
it and then once you've done that work
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
you have to report the
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
work but as I read it as long as you
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
don't do further work that's you just
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
have to report it there I just reported
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
it this is what I did I sent the I sent
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
pictures in preferably um and then they
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
say okay that that makes sense that's
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
with that's if you didn't get that's in
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
like the extreme case this is like the
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
emergency case you're you know you've
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
got a bank that's collapsing and you've
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
got you know some kind of fence or
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
something that's going to collapse
 
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay I but I did see
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
said so like maybe you've seen 3156
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
emergency okay I'm looking I'm trying to
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
find the um Dees Wetlands emergency fact
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
sheet because
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:58.110 align:start position:0%
that yeah
okay

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:29.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay so then
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
you what what I saw somewhere though it
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
said that that the um homeowner would
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
still have to
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
um submit permits applic a permit a
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
regular permit application after the um
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
done in in the in the email you sent on
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
um on the 18th right um You said I just
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
quote you um you said as you can see
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
below in the rule 130 uh
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
352a a home owner sorry a homeowner May
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
request an emergency authorization and
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
then you underlined prior so I think the
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
prior was the thing that you were trying
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
to focus on there um prior to filling
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
out the lengthy and detailed application
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
is what you said right so I think you're
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
352a so yeah so a property owner May
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
request an authorization to act on an
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
emergency basis prior to filing an
 
00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
application under ENT WT 310 or 311 so
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
that says to me me that yes you can get
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
this emergency
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
authorization but you have to follow up
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
with filing the normal
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
wrong so with with this change this just
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
small change of taking out the word
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
remove I think
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
does a good amount to clarify things but
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
I think even further
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
clarification should be some sort of
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
statement in that part of Statute that
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
says removal of storm debris from a
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
stream by the property owner is
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
permissible and does not require a
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
permit either an emergency permit or an
 
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:53.910 align:start position:0%
permit either an emergency permit or an
regular

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
permit yeah I I I guess I these seem to
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
be in in conflict to each other to me
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
the um the fact sheet which says which
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
seems to me says that you can fill out
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
the abbreviated version for emergency
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
authorization um to get things cleaned
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
up right but then you don't have to file
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
file another one and this the line you
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
just read that says prior like the prior
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
does make me question but I do wonder if
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
we if we could generalize that um uh you
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
know the statute to to provide ex
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions by rule yeah um and Dees were
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
willing they can testify perhaps or talk
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps about how they could CLE clean
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
up this language and what they int this
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
yeah this be fine with that okay
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely I and I think that is it's
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
just a matter of clarifying what the
 
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.389 align:start position:0%
just a matter of clarifying what the
intent

00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
is and if we can do that and accomplish
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm a happy
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
comments I just have myself I have one
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh just in reading the law as it is now
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
whether you removed remove remove or not
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
just the way it reads the way I read it
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
until I had a chance to really think on
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
it no person shall excavate fill dredge
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
or construct any structures and or or on
 
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:35.759 align:start position:0%
the bank of any
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
bank I first read it to mean that This
 
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
bank I first read it to mean that This
concerns

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
structures uh it would be
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
better in if if we do an amendment to
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
May to maybe change it to no person
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
shall construct any structures comma
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
remove excavate
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
remove uh fill dredge
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
in any Bank otherwise to me it it'll as
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
it exists now it appears that this only
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
modified what a person could do with
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
structures and that's not what it's
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be I
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
presume yeah I I I agree I I think the
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
language here is very clumsy and it's
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
not it's not real clear what someone can
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
do and can't
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
do you know in terms especially in in um
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
an emergency situation or a situation
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
where you've got a a stream that's all
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
blocked up uh on your property that's
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is and I'd be happy to you
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
know work with representative um Harvey
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
bolia to to um clear up that language if
 
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.990 align:start position:0%
bolia to to um clear up that language if
you

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
like I would personally I think it would
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
help okay but uh
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the language the additional
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
language that you're looking to put in
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%

Dees again my name is Darlene forc
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
I the previous 20 some years was the
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
Shoreland section
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
supervisor which also covered Shoreline
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
for wetlands and then in the last two
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
years have now become the wetlands bu
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
administrator uh so representing the
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services on
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
Wetland bureau's behalf I've distri Ed
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
this morning a copy of the rules
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
pertaining to emergency situations which
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
is ENB WT 315 as well as the emergency
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
actions fact sheet so that you folks
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
could see those
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
today uh she's not here but I do want to
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
thank representative Harvey bullia for
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
taking the time um like an hour of time
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
on an afternoon to contact us and and
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
discuss and uh Thea is on to kind of
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
point out what she was hearing from
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
folks that we might not have been
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and one of the things she
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned was there's this issue of
 
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned was there's this issue of
remove

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
um which when the department as you can
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
see from the emergency action back sheet
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
when folks call us Woody debris we don't
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
even think that remove applies to Woody
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
debris we don't believe it's
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional because it's not part of
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
the land at that point it is lying on
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
the land so it never crosses our mind
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
but knowing that the issue is the word
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
remove why is this
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
issue why why is this a source of of
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
concern for
 
00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:36.029 align:start position:0%
concern for
folks

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
um the only place that remove occurs is
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
statement and I was quite open with
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative bolia that we're looking
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
at that word remove and we have been as
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
we go through and are in the process of
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
updating our rules trying to determine
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
what that means for our
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um I representative rulu as
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the common makes it weird
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
it makes it look like you're removing re
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
the structure there's a comma missing
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
um absolutely agree with you on that
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
there is a comma missing um not the
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
first piece of legislation that's lacked
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
a comma won't be the
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
a comma won't be the
last

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
so I understand that what's interesting
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
though is if you read that sentence and
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've looked at
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
is each one no one shall excavate a bank
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
no one shall fill a bank Wetland Mar you
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
know Bank Marsh it says no one shall
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
remove a bank
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
Marsh or public water doesn't say remove
 
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.149 align:start position:0%
Marsh or public water doesn't say remove
material

00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
material
from

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.710 align:start position:0%
from
um

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
so I understand wanting to strike the
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
word remove but we're not certain that
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
it actually applies to this material
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
anyway it may not be the change that you
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
need to affect what you wish to do in
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
context just grammatically it still
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem that this would apply to
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
Woody debris I understand the word is a
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
hang-up but I'm not certain written you
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
know read on its plain face English
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
meaning it means what folks have taken
 
00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
meaning it means what folks have taken
it

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.230 align:start position:0%
it
for

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
so if you remove that word if you strike
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
the term
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
remove what you're really striking is
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on removing a bank
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
removing a surface water
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
removing a wetland of marsh which we've
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
looked at is it might also mean
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
dewatering and we have had some recent
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
issues with some gravel mining
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
operations and other things where folks
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
have dewatered wet
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
areas so please understand in context
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're not certain that that word
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
does what it's alleged to do and I'm not
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
saying that because I want to you know
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
undermine representative eron concerns
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
are very real and and we respect them
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we want to find the best way to
 
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
and we want to find the best way to
correct

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
them the rules in chapter 300 are about
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be reopened there are many things
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
throughout chapter 300 that need to be
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
fixed and the emergency Pro procedures
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
in 315 are only one of them we cannot
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
for the life of us figure out why
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
private homeowners get 30 days but
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state only gets 10
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
days to report that makes no sense we
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be happy to correct that language
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
that said is prior to getting an
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
application prior to filing an
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
application you may request an EA
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
because we do not interpret that as you
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
always must do an after theact
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
application we filter these as if there
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
is additional work that you need to do
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you lose a covert for your driveway
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
if you pull that covert out put that put
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
the new covert in and back fill over it
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
there's no work left to be done
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
therefore all the work was covered under
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
the EA we do not request an after the
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
fact application um in part because we
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't have time to deal with the EXT we
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
try surprisingly enough to not make
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork for ourselves that we don't
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
have to do we require the after theact
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
reporting because that way if someone
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
complains we have a record of it so that
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
we don't pursue things at violation and
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
make people's lives unnecessarily
 
00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:22.750 align:start position:0%
make people's lives unnecessarily
stressful

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
um so we would be happy to to work with
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
folks on rules we know we have to open
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
this whole section we know we're going
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
to be making changes to it because the
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
time frames there's a 30 to 60 day
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
limitation on how long you can do the
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
work we're looking at the 30 60 days and
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
with the sheer volume of things to be
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
done the inability to obtain materials
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it doesn't matter if
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're a homeowner or you're a town
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
and other than the fact that we give the
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
homeowner longer to respond everything
 
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
else in this is essentially the same
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're a homeowner or you're
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
municipality the rules apply the
 
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.029 align:start position:0%
municipality the rules apply the
same

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
so there's as I said there's a lot in
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
there that we know we need to fix um
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
when you have a widespread disaster
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
event everyone is competing for the same
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
resources so giving someone 30 days that
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
presumes that you can actually find
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
somebody with the equipment to do it
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
find the materials you know whether it's
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
a c rock fill and actually get it done
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
in 30 days and I also want to you know
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
point out that when we do this it's not
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily from the disaster it's from
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
the date of discovery on an on emergency
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
authorization one is you can do work
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
during the disaster and the other is
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
where we have so many absentee Property
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
Owners if you're living out of state and
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
you come up to your place when things
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
finally clear up enough that you can get
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
here and you realize oh this is bad
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
it might have happened two months ago
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
but we go by the time of
 
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
but we go by the time of
Discovery

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
Discovery
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
so I I guess where I'd sum this up
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
is the word
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
remov or might not mean what it's been
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
imply to me you might
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
not we know what the perception is and
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
we know we need to correct it because
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's causing people unnecessary
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
stress um but to actually make a change
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental change read that word for
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
word this still doesn't look like it
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
applies to Woody debris or trash in a in
 
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.149 align:start position:0%
applies to Woody debris or trash in a in
a

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
stream um that said we're happy to work
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
with folks on the rules we know we're
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
opening these up um we know that that
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
process is flawed we are getting ready
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
to introduce new tools we're happy to
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
work with you and the rule making
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
Authority for this is RSA 42
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
a11 you skip down to it's like five or
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's like Roman 56 or 7 somewhere in
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
there it says we can adopt rules that
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
talk about activities that can be can be
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
conducted without permits that is the
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
authority that we use to do this um and
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
it probably is even cited at the
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of um the emergency
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
procedures but we have the tools to make
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
this happen um and we know that we're
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
going in to fix them so there is another
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
method happy to work with folks
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
um we did this last year with the the
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
pbn process we're happy to you know if
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
you guys want to hold this out there to
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we fix that we're happy
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
to say yeah we're going to fix this and
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
if we don't fix it you guys are going to
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
fix it for us um but there's more than
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
one way to there's more than one way to
 
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.070 align:start position:0%
one way to there's more than one way to
approach

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.149 align:start position:0%
approach
this

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
um just please you know keep that in
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
question from representative
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman thanks for your
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
helpful analysis on the sentence
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
construction so a quick question for you
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
um so I understand representative aon's
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
constituent concern and and
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey buo as well um on
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
the First on that first sentence would
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
you put the comma after structures or
 
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
you put the comma after structures or
after

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.549 align:start position:0%
 
construct

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
put it after construct because it be
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
constructed on or in any Bank okay so as
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
I read this sentence no person shall
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
excavate in or on any Bank flat right
 
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
skip the rest of the series if you want
 
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
to really determine the meaning of this
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
no person shall
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
remove what onor any so I think the
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
comma has to go after structures okay
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
right because I think remove modifies or
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
references something and and there's no
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
other something in this sentence besides
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
structure there's no other object that
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
remove modifies if if that's my reading
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
of it right because you don't remove in
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
or on would make sense you do dredge you
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
do fill you do excavate in or on but it
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
almost I think it would be better
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
constructed as two sentences right you
 
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
have two different two different sets of
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
verbs here one is talking about removing
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
that modifies I think the intent is
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
structures what is the verb after remove
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
Phil problem is that doesn't so remove
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
being out of sequence with construction
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
of structures because it wouldn't
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily fill up structure you need
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
two sentences so we've been looking at
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
it is does it mean remove the bank we've
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
interpreted it as remove the bank remove
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
the marsh remove the we've been and I'll
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
be honest with you like we um remove any
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
Bank okay so
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
remove any bank and the in or on refers
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
to structures as does
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
construct wow it's a terrible sentence
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes it is no one's going to argue that
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
so so I see so I see there's multiple
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
problems because you could actually read
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
it no person shall
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
excavate any
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
Bank remove any Bank fill any Bank flat
 
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.230 align:start position:0%
Bank remove any Bank fill any Bank flat
Marsh

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
Marsh
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
swamp construct or remove any structures
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a terrible s we really really
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
with sir uh can we get everybody
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the conversation it's a it's
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee work session or are we
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
having a new public hearing it's a sub
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
work session so informal discussion is
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
definitely appropriate for what it's
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
1968 the word remove had been alter and
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
that was decided to be a little too
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive so the word alter in the
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
and and what I'm hearing you say is it
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's immaterial in terms of the
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislation because you
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
never had a never met it to refer to a
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of debris that washed into your
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
Culvert which is essentially a seasonal
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
stream yeah that's we don't consider
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
that to be a part of the actual resource
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
itself so it's either in your opinion if
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't mean to put words in your
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
mouth but in your opinion it's either
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
not necessary or we could use this
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity and use this legislation as
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to correct those sentences or
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
you can do it in rules um this is
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron's legislation with
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
representative aon's purpose so I don't
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
want to hijack representatives langu to
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
like fix a problem that she didn't mean
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
to fix so I don't think it's fair for us
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
to s for for Dees I don't think it's
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
fair for Dees to do that but I don't
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
think this as a this wording issue is
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the solution to the
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
problem representative Aaron is trying
 
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.310 align:start position:0%
problem representative Aaron is trying
to

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.149 align:start position:0%
to
solve

00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
gu representative B for
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming in and taking
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
our questions so I've been so this for
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
the second time this morning um you said
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a new way of
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
reporting coming up an app or something
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
like that so I had some questions about
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
how that would speed the matters
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
up um and what the flow of um like the
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
chain of custody of the information
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
would be once somebody says oh there's
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
something wrong in my yard I got to do
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
something about it and takes a
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
picture of what happened and sends it in
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you we have been using um we have
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
been adapting an online e filing
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
process to create a tool in which people
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
can come
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
in it can be the owner or it can be an
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
agent on behalf of the
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
owner create a file list the address of
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
the site in question list the contact
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
information for the person who owns the
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
property or who's going to be doing the
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
work they'll have the option of actually
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
using a mapping tool where you can zoom
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the area put a dot on a
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
map they can explain what they're going
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
to do just type in in a narrative this
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
is we need to replace the cber here and
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
they can upload the
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
photo if they're doing it as an after
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
Action Report they can upload the before
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
photo there is no fee associated with it
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
once it's once they upload everything
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
all the fields are completed the map dot
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
is optional if all the required fields
 
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.669 align:start position:0%
is optional if all the required fields
are

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
completed then they can hit send that
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
will come into us we will log that into
 
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.029 align:start position:0%
will come into us we will log that into
our

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
database um I've got to be honest up
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
until this past spring or actually I
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
guess it would probably be about
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
November of last year these were all
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
handled do disaster events and they
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
weren't logged in the wetlands normal
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
database which meant tracking them
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards and figuring out who did what
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
wear on some of the 2021 Disaster
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
Response and trying to get paperwork out
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
to people to file their applications or
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
their insurance or whatever they needed
 
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.950 align:start position:0%
their insurance or whatever they needed
it

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
for was hard it was far we made that a
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
lot more difficult on ourselves than it
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
had to be so now that will be logged
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
into our database which means we can
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
show where all the after action damage
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
is which helps us report out
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
later um but once they send that to us
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
we'll log it in we'll then send them a
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
confirmation letter that identifies
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
either the work you did the work you did
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
complies with 3154 or 3155 no further
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
permitting is necessary the work you did
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't even in our jurisdiction thank
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
you for reporting it you definitely are
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
in compliance with Wetlands rules rules
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
of law uh the work you did complied
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
please note if you need any additional
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
work the future work will require a
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
permit or there will be some that will
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
say yeah that did not comply we have had
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
some folks who have done some things
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
that didn't fit that process that didn't
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
comply and you should be submitting an
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
application for that but we will then be
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
able to send them a cover letter we'll
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
send them a response that closes that
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
door for them and gives us a permanent
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
record so that if anybody calls us and
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
said you know like hey I got back from
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
vacation and this happened or my
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
property was being damaged and I'm
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
blaming that work over there even if it
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
was that work it was legal like we can
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
put to bed future complaints we can
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
track where we have weak spots in the
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
system uh but it will be there is no fee
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
there is no it just gives them a way
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
that they can load everything in hit
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
send uh we can log it and give them a
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
closure thank you that was very
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
helpful representative Darby for another
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
question or statement yeah thank you Mr
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
chair I have a few questions if it's
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
okay um first off I I think you just
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
explained why the prior word I hopefully
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
people can hear me I think you just
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
explained why the word prior is in
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
352a which is that there are some cases
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
which is where the work wasn't compliant
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
where you do require the full process
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
but you know to representative aon's U
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
Point um it looks um it looks uh
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
excessive in most cases and in fact it
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't even seem like it's required in
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
many cases so in the work um would you
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
consider uh would you imagine the
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
department considering rewarding that to
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
make it more um obvious when those cases
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be when you Revis these when you
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
re um reopen these Ru rules yeah I've
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
already made a note to do that yeah we
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
will definitely that's that's an easy
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
fix and we will definitely add something
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
we will strike prior out of there and do
 
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.710 align:start position:0%
we will strike prior out of there and do
an

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
after um we'll put something at the end
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
that says if additional work is to be
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
done in fact I think that's picked up in
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
the a actions after emergencies at
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
3156 um anything that's needs to be done
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
after the emergency has ended we can
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
expand that to say that's where your
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
application is necessary great my second
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
question was you said that you're going
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
to reopen them what's the timeline
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking at for that well I had
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the first draft of that
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
available to staff
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
um uh Thursday of last
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
week which would have put us before the
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
Wetland Council in February which is our
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
first step before actually going into
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
the process uh we want them adopted by
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
September or
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
October of this year so we look at all
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
of we look at changes to 300 as a
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
critical operational issue for us um so
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's a high priority for us and this is
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
just one of the this is going to be
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
added into that high priority list of
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
changes okay great thank you my last
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
question is with respect to um you know
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
represent Aaron's um concern that the
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
the wording in the statute is pretty
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
black and white it says you know you
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
need a permit but there are cases where
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
you don't need a permit um which are you
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
know um in emergency you know response
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
situations would would you be would you
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
think would you be um accepting of you
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
know some language um at the end of that
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
sentence that said something like accept
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
emergencies I think that's probably too
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
restrictive because that's going to let
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
people think they need a permit only if
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency when in reality you
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
have additional except exeptions further
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
down in A3 there's the world's longest
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
sentence um down below so perhaps even
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
broader except as Exempted by rule by
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay right are you finished yes thank
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
you sorry representative done for
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
question or question in your opinion do
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
you feel like this bill is necessary or
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
can you fix it through the rules
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
now okay so in your opinion this bill is
 
00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:36.790 align:start position:0%
now okay so in your opinion this bill is
not

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
necessary we have yeah
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
you that's our decision I know I
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
know you know representative harb thank
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
this question I actually have two where
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about floods emergencies
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
but am I incorrect at any time can I
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
remove Woody debris a trash at any
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
time okay my second question is would it
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
be appropriate if it's not already in
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
the regulations to just add a sentence
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere that says specifically Woody
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
debris or trash in a stream can be
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
removed without a
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
permit if you chose to do
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
that I would suggest the place to do it
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
is further down in A3 there's a list of
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
exemptions that's already
 
00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
exemptions that's already
there

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
there
[Music]

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
um as I said we have the world's longest
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
sentence which is comprised of a whole
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
lot of things that are
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions in fact most of A3 there's a
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
series of exemptions with an A3 that
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be the appropriate place to put it
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
if you wish to do
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
so thank you
anyone

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
else if I may I would just say one thing
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
experience we have had some applications
 
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.510 align:start position:0%
experience we have had some applications
once

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
um we have had applications where folks
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
have actually gone onto Lake beds and
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
recovered artifacts under the guys that
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
it was
trash

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
trash
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um when you choose to if you choose to
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
language um there are many wrecks on the
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
beds of lakes in New Hampshire that are
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
tourist attractions and dive sites that
 
00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.430 align:start position:0%
tourist attractions and dive sites that
are

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
technically public trust so if you're
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to say something about trash you
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
might just want to make sure that you
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't create a loophole where someone
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
goes down and actually takes something
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's part of the state's historic
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
Legacy shall we say um that would be the
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
only thing I would caution on that
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you um Mr CH
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the and the other thing about Woody
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
debris um so on private property clearly
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I'm not arguing against that
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
but there's um you know I I I'm on the
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
public water advisory access Advisory
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
Board and I was down in uh at the niss
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh River Management um and one of the
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
things that is a real area of contention
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
is removing Woody debris in streams in
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh rivers rivers that are um where
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
people canoe because fishermen want it
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
and canoeists don't want it so it it
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
would need to be the exemption would
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
need to be specifically on private
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
property as opposed to people thinking
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
they can just go pluck this stuff out of
 
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
they can just go pluck this stuff out of
any

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
River that is the most common request
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we get about Woody de breze from
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
canoe and kayak groups who want to do a
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
river we go down this River we'll get a
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
call yes we go down this River all the
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
time there's a log Jam it's a hazard
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
someone's going to get hurt we want to
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
pull it out and the first thing that we
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
ask is do you own the
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
land and many times they don't and we'll
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
tell them to get the permission of the
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
landowner and the landowner will refuse
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
depending on what the land owner's
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
interest is so that is a
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
valid riverbeds are privately
 
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
valid riverbeds are privately
held

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
held
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
and you do have to unfortunately not all
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
the people are going to
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
respect that they don't own that they're
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
just going to want to continue to canoe
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.670 align:start position:0%
just going to want to continue to canoe
down

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
it so that is a valid point of caution
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
Derby okay representative Aaron you had
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
a comment concerning that D
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's
 
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's
question

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
talking Woody debris yeah I'm not just
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
talking about Woody debris after a storm
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
you get a lot of rocks
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
silt uh vegetation that's been ripped up
 
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.630 align:start position:0%
silt uh vegetation that's been ripped up
from

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
Upstream that's that's also part of this
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
debris that that results from flooding
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
and storm
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
damage and
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
hearing the emphasis is just on plucking
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
out Woody debris and I don't know that
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's that i' want to limit it to that
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's not what I was just trying to
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
respond to that one thing and and I
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
think I don't want to speak for
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative harb but I heard
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative harb say since Woody
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
debris is not called out maybe it needs
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
to be explicitly mentioned someplace I
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we're trying to under under
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
estim emphasize at all the ability to
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
restore the stream bed where you where
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
you need to right yeah okay just so
 
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.230 align:start position:0%
you need to right yeah okay just so
clear

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.750 align:start position:0%
on thank
you

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
have your name am I okay to speak from
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
here yeah go ahead sure Kevin Nyan I
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
work at the Department of Transportation
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
and the environmental Bureau I manage
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
the environmental Bureau there I think
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
it's important um as we're talking
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
about what you you know what is
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
allowable without notifying Dees after
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
or during an emergency I think it's
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
important to be clear that um I think
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
the rules you know except in the fact
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
that maybe there's some language that
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
could be clarified that removing Woody
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
debris and accumulated debris from a
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
stream by a by a private land owner is
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
something that is is not harmful per se
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know but as we're talking
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
about um removing rocks or or relocating
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
rocks along a stream bed or or or
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
without notifying Dees or putting a a b
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
Bank back without an emergency
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
authorization so something that Dees is
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
aware of that could have ramifications
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
for Downstream infrastructure so for
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
example if we're if we're talking about
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh a private property a private land
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
owner who's not just
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
stabilizing what happened because the
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
emergency right so stabilizing would be
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
you armor with you know what's left or
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
something like that in an emergency that
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
I that I completely understand but if
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about taking that stuff
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
and putting it back what happens if
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
there's a state asset Downstream a
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
bridge for example that's been
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
undermined the abutments are undermined
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
and it's precarious as it is if Upstream
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
land owners are now putting that stream
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
back to where it was without
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
notification or without de's involvement
 
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
who can say oh I understand what you're
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do but you need to be aware of
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
this Downstream or in that case Dees
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
notifying do in this example that that
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some work that isn't
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
coordinated you could have the
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of negatively
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
affecting that uh that um compromised
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Downstream so I think if
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about cleaning out a
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
stream channel to make sure that it can
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
flow or
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
stabilizing uh stabilizing property
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
after or during emergency I think the
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
rules adequately deal with that now but
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about putting something
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
back without notification or
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
coordination with Dees I think that can
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
become a real problem for Downstream
 
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
become a real problem for Downstream
sensitive

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um if I can that there is
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
a gentleman that has contacted us on
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
this December floods out
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
of sandag and Country Club um don't
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
think it's in Borum but it's it's up
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
there in that neck of the woods who
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
tried to build a levy as the water came
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
up um he did get it done he did put the
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
river back in its Channel but not before
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
the river did a significant amount of
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
damage his request to us was when is the
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
state going to come and fix the
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
river because his point was he couldn't
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
do it he just didn't have the money to
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
do it and it didn't matter if he did
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
anything to the river on his property
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
the part of it he owned if the person
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
Downstream didn't do anything and the
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
person Upstream didn't do anything and
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
they everybody did their own
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
thing if the gist of this bill is that
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
every homeowner gets to go in and move
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
sediment we're not talking about Woody
 
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
sediment we're not talking about Woody
debris

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
debris
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
anymore that every homeowner who has the
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
means to actually move
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
material not every homeowner is going to
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
have that goes in and does what they
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
want to their portion of the riverbed
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
own which after some of these floods I
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't even know where the property line
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
is because River start to make you know
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
the the new channels Channel changes I'm
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
not even going to go get into how a
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
surveyor figures out the center line of
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
the channel
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
anymore everyone goes in and does what
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
they think is right to take care of
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
their property not to do what's right
 
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:11.079 align:start position:0%
for the river I'm going to make sure my
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
property doesn't get damaged then the
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
person Upstream the person Downstream
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
the person across the river from
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
you you're going to end up with a bunch
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
of people that are doing work that's
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to one another I do
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
not have the solution to this but I can
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
tell you environmentally scientifically
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
rivers are Dynamic systems you cannot
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
get that River to do what you want one
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
property at a
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
time one of the big things I mentioned
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
we are behind the game on this flood
 
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
we are behind the game on this flood
issue

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
is how do you how do you address the
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
system as a
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
system this cannot that is one of the
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
things that's fundamentally wrong with
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is it cannot be every every man for
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
themselves to see what
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
happens and if it's roulette someone is
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
going to have their property damaged
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be because someone was
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
trying to be mean to their neighbor it's
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
because these things are Dynamic systems
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
that are hard to predict and seldom do
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
what we think they're going to do it
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
requires a coordinated response the
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
Wetland statute opens
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
with we recognize that the peac meal
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
unregulated impacts to these systems to
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
Wetlands to jurisdictional areas will
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
result in it lists a series of negative
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
things it is the peacemeal nature of
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
that that is not that would be something
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
that the wetlands Bureau would ADV would
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
inform you would be very
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
dangerous it's not that we're going to
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
Advocate we're just going to tell you
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
experience shows if
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
everybody goes in and does their thing
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
on the limited part of the rivered along
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
its reach that they
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
own it is not the river is it's not
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
going to solve anybody's problem you're
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
just going to make new problems for
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
other people that's the thing that's
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
missing yes there's a problem yes
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
material is
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
deposited it's no one has the problem is
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
everyone on that section of the river is
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
under stress and you don't have time and
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have me and there's a lot of
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
ation that comes
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
out but there needs to be a coordinated
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
response to addressing these River
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
issues not every man for themselves and
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the answer to that is
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
I know do has been involved with several
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
projects in different towns that we've
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
been trying to help and consult on but
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
it's a systematic problem that covers
 
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.630 align:start position:0%
it's a systematic problem that covers
multiple

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
properties and there's not really mean
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
right now coordinated
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
response do I have the answer no but
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's the coordinated response that
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't create a problem that's missing
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to build that but
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
need I think we're going a little I
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
think we're kind of gone a little bit
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
further than this uh bill I think
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
intense uh but that's my personal
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
opinion all right we uh
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
of this is put this to the committee
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
where we go from
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
here I mean this is not an executive
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
session so uh just uh think on what we
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
might want to do with this bill uh there
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a uh we are we looking for an
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I thought we were at an
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
amendment early on but I think we might
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
have moved away from that I'm not
 
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.630 align:start position:0%
have moved away from that I'm not
certain

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative rung for remember we
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
only have a couple of minutes okay thank
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think uh when Miss forse
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there may be a good
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
solution to this without having to pass
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that there could be some
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the rules I'd like to
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps ask representative Aaron if she
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
and Miss fores could you know maybe work
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
together on that rules change to make
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
sure that any change um addresses the
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
the the problem that these homeowners
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:52:03.309 align:start position:0%
 
event

00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
say change rules
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
but that's why I think it needs to be
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
clear made clear in the
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
RSA what a homeowner can cannot do in
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
the event of De beinging up a stream on
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
all right remember we got two minutes
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
now okay I mean I I um my preference of
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
course maybe not of course but would be
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
that this was handled by rules but I
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
respect um representative Aaron and
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh Harvey buy as as
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
perspective that an amendment would help
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
it I think that the combination of what
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
um representative har F buy put together
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
as well as you know M another minor
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
change to I that like I was discussed
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
earlier um I think would would wrap this
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
thing up
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
honestly okay represent representative
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
wolf or comment I'm concerned one
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
minute we have one minute okay okay I'm
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about putting changing one
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
word now because of the repercussions
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
that came from that we've heard all
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I think it would be
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
unwise to remove one word When Miss
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
Frost said they interpret it another way
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think we need to clarify that
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation and then maybe a an
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment won't even be
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
necessary but I'm scared to start
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:00.789 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
Y for the for the first time
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead y representative given the
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
amount of information that we were
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
presented with today that's additional
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that there may be some kind of
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
a non-legislative
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
solution but also the concerns of some
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee members that we do need
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm just wondering if
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's if we would if it's possible to
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
time uh this I do not have this bill
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled for uh executive session so we
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
do have more
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
time you know except we do eventually
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
have crossover time and then the bill
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
yes so we we have to we have into March
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we do if we wish to do it I would
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
rather not spend that amount of time
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
but you know it is available now it is
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
not I next week we have an executive
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
session this bill is not on it a lot of
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
other bills are including the bills
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing now
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
so last wrap it up I just um mention
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
that um Miss Forest I believe said if we
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to hang on to the bill send it to
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
interim study um that way they'll have
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
the Draft rules out um so that they can
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
start the process like she described we
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
we can all and representative Aaron can
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
look at those draft rules make sure that
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
they um meet the intent um and then we
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
can decide a you know after the summer
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
if the Draft rules be they're moving
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
represent or sorry um Miss Forest said
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
they were moving very quickly on this
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we could just sort of hold on to it
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
minute all right we I will close
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the work
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
session and I yeah it well that says
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
you oh oh we go by Verizon Standard Time
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
let's yeah give subm minute while we
 
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
let's yeah give subm minute while we
change

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:37.789 align:start position:0%
 
over

00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'll open the hearing of on House Bill
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
1143 including control of cyano bacteria
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
blooms under the New Hampshire clean
 
00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:50.950 align:start position:0%
blooms under the New Hampshire clean
Lakes

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
program chair recognizes representative
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
rung as the prime sponsor okay thank you
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy to introduce House
 
00:57:01.599 --> 00:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy to introduce House
Bill

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
1143 this bill um came out as a as a
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
result of a report that the state issued
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
um regarding ccio bacteria management
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
and um there's the suggestion from the
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh DS in that report and also with input
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
from a uh citizens or Community advisory
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
panel was to incorporate
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria into um current statute
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
which um outlines the clean lat program
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
so you you'll see in the Bild um where
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
specific uh uh paragraphs are added that
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
address the needs for C uh the needs and
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
strategies for cyanobacteria
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
mitigation um DS is here I'll let them
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
speak in more detail they're probably
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
better app um in a better position to
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
answer questions but I do want to alert
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
the committee that within the hour there
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment to this bill and
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
the specific changes that the amendment
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
reflects is that um there'll be language
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the issuance of permits
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
for inl management projects including
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
but not limited to the use of chemical
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
or physical inl treatments for the
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
specific purposes of preventing or
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
remediating cyanobacteria blooms and
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
then there'll be a strike out of
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
language that's in the very um end of
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that
 
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.510 align:start position:0%
the bill that
says

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
um uh chemical applications or physical
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
treatments shall be made in consultation
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
with the fishing game department and
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
shall be implemented with or without the
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
concurrence of the Department of fishing
 
00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
game that last phrase is going to be
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
deleted it'll just end with Shelby made
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
in consultant with fishing game
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
department so I expect that any minute
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
that amendment I I won't wait until the
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
executive session to to share that with
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
you it should be ready soon but I'd be
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain any questions because
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
as I said there are officials from uh
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
Dees that are here that are going to be
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
in a better position to answer your
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay there any questions by
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee will you entertain putting
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
giving us a oh I will yes sorry Mr
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
chair repres representative Darby thank
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative R
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um so this is uh you know it
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
says the department shall be directed to
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
reduce nutrient inputs but then it seems
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
that it's really there the focus is two
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
things education and then in the case of
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
lakes where chemical treatment might
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to do that of course there's
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
lots of lots and lots of other ways that
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
phosphorus can be you know nutrients can
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
be reduced but that you really just
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
trying to limit DS's scope to these two
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
areas um thank you very much
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative for the
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
question you know there is an array of
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
issues with Lakes there's a lot of
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
phosphorus that appears from outside the
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
lake that through runoff or erosion that
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
gets into the lake fertilizer runoff is
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
a good example or septic system failures
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that can add
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in but then there's also
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
lakes that um they just have phosphorus
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
that enters the water column from
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
internal loading so phosphorus that may
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
naturally be found in the sediment of
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
the lake under certain conditions where
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
oxygen levels might get very low um that
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
phosphorus can be released into the lake
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
and and add so there there's some Lakes
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
where you could reduce all of the
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
external loading but still have excess
 
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
phosphorus from the internal loading so
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
what what this bill is is doing is it's
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
just allowing de s to formalize any
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria response that's needed
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
Lake by Lake because every Lake's going
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
to be different and and get that into
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
statute so that rules can be drafted to
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
support the work that's done to mitigate
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms does that answer
 
01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.270 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms does that answer
your

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
question for a followup thank you Mr
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
chair just but you're you mentioned some
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
other cases you know fertilizer so on
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth but you're not trying to um
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
Pro allow Dees to you know limit provide
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions or rules regarding that no
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
many of the activities that are used to
 
01:01:36.799 --> 01:01:38.309 align:start position:0%
many of the activities that are used to
mitigate

01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
phosphorus um from entering a lake those
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
are are typically identified through a
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan which is a
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
scientific study that's done on the lake
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's usually many water quality
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
analysis that's done on the lake and
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
they can determine what specific issues
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
face that Lake and offer remediation
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
projects and um this just allows Dees to
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
oversee all of those
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
projects um and be able to um make sure
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
that they're addressed in a in a
 
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.109 align:start position:0%
that they're addressed in a in a
formalized

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
formalized
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
cohesive strategy to to you know and I
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
think it also and I don't want to put
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
words in DSS mouth but it it makes them
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
a partner in that work for instance you
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
could have a Lake Association that
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
develops a watershed management plan for
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
their Lake and they can go and do things
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
but this what this bill would allow is
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
to um are um specify how Dees can can
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
become a partner in that process and and
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
get their involvement it's actually very
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
much crafted and and the clean Lakes
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
program actually got started I think um
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
to address aquatic invasive species and
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
to get Dees involved in that process and
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
so CYO bacteria is is just being added
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
on to that clean laks
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
program is that answer
 
01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative wolf you thank you
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
question you talked at the very
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
beginning about naturally occurring
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in a lake that's natur
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
overloaded does this
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
give the dees or anybody else the
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
authority to alter an existing thing
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
because maybe some of that phosphorus is
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
creating and I don't know um blooms
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
because of temperature changes and
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
things like that uh so is it
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
allowing somebody to alter a naturally
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
occurring cause of CYO blooms cob
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms yeah thank you very much
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
for that question representative yes
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
having this in statute allows Dees to um
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
develop rules and and permitting
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines for an in-lake treatment that
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
would prevent that phosphorus that's in
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
the sediment from entering the water
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
column I mean up until you know several
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
years ago phosphorus that was in the
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
sediment stayed in the sediment and the
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
oxygenation of the water happened
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
naturally through the lake turnover but
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
what we've seen the trend is that um
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
water isn't getting as cold in the
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
winter and it's warming up very quickly
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
in the spring and it's causing a
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
temperature striation in the lake so the
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
bottom water isn't getting pulled up and
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
oxygenated it's because it's almost like
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
we're having temperature layering in the
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
lake so you may have the top layer that
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
turns over but the bottom layer doesn't
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's very inefficient and it gets
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
depleted of oxygen just from organic
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
matter that may be at the bottom of the
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
lake that's um decomposing and and using
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
oxygen or it could be fish that might be
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
at the bottom that are consuming oxygen
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
but the water at the bottom of the lake
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
becomes what's called anoxic it's very
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
low oxygen and under that
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
chemical um situation the the phosphorus
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's normally bound to other elements
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
in the bottom of the sediment becomes
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
released and so there is there are
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
several inl treatments the one that's
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
most common and the one that New
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has some experience in with um
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Lake and nippo lake is they um do
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
what's called an Alum treatment and they
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
take a lot of water measurements it's
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh complex process to um
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
calculate the dosing of Alum and there's
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
a company that comes out and they after
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
they acquire all this data on the lake
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
they spray Alum on the surface and that
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
Alum Goes Down And as it's going down to
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
the sediment because it's heavier than
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
water it's picking up phosphorus but it
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
also creates what's called A Flock at
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
the very bottom of the lake and it that
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
flock is serves as a chemical barrier
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
maybe even a physical barrier I'm not
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
sure but from phosphorus from from
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
entering that water column and then
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
triggering these cyanobacteria blooms so
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
this inl treatment yes it is preventing
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
the natural release of phosphorus but
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
that phosphorus historically was not
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
naturally released it's because of the
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
oxygen levels that stayed in the
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
sediment so by addressing in Lake
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
treatment in this statute it allows Dees
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to um to apply that through
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
rules and permitting to be able to
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
specify that I hope I didn't is did I
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
question you need to have the inl
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
treatment to um prevent the in Lake
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.279 --> 01:07:18.269 align:start position:0%
 
answered

01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
so for an additional question no it's
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's a follow through followup if I
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
may thank
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
you so in certain
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
cases we may be messing with Mother
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
Nature and what is occurring
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
naturally exactly Mother Nature under
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
the warming Trend we've seen is um
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is changing its chemical I
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too technical but it's
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
being released from this bond with other
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
metals and it's going into the water
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's nature that's chemistry we we
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
want to alter that chemistry so that the
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
phosphorus stays at the bottom of the
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
lake and Alum is a natural chemical it's
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
found more question represent mon thank
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
you um and is some of that old sediment
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
or organic matter it may not actually be
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
natural but it may be from um deposits
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
made by humans decades ago so it's not
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of the natural original
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
state of the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
lake yeah true that that's true
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
represent L Montaine thank you for the
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
question it could be just a buildup of
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
leaves and and Woody material that we
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
talked about at during our work session
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know it just gets into the lake it
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
blows in some people unfortunately dump
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of their yard waste in Lakes um uh
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
we we people work hard to prevent that
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
but yeah so that's you say that's Mother
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
Nature it's natural material didn't get
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
there through Mother Nature sometimes
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it did but um and I I do want to
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
stress that many leges that are
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing chronic cyanobacteria
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
blooms may not even need an Alam
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
treatment um it's a watershed management
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
PL would identify those strategies that
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
could lower phosphorus just through um
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects like rebuilding a
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
culvert um changing the slope of a of a
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
road that might go along or driveways um
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
building up vegetation I I mean we we
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
had a bill earlier about just the
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
vegetation along the shoreline and
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
people violating the shoreline
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
protection act because they're taking
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
off vegetation which is increasing
 
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.110 align:start position:0%
off vegetation which is increasing
erosion

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
erosion
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
runoff um many times we can help Lakes
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
by making sure those activities don't
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
happen um and really strengthening the
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the shoreline protection
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
act so that may those may be enough that
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
Alum treatment is really the last ditch
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
Resort um to Stave off the phosphorus
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
blooms that answer your
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
none thank you
 
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.390 align:start position:0%

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
Services morning Mr chair morning
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David Neils
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the Chief Quantic biologist at Dees
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm also director of the jod Conor
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
anology Center I'm passing around
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
letters of testimony and a couple of
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
copies of the exe executive summary of
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
the CYO bacteria plan so I'm happy to
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
share those with you I believe those
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
were emailed to you uh previously so you
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
should have them in your
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
inbox um here uh with the opportunity to
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
testify on HB uh
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
1143 which expands uh New Hampshire's Uh
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
current Clean laks Program which is
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
authorized under RSA
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
47 the department supports this bill and
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to offer the following
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
information for the committee to
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
consider and I'm happy to answer some of
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
your questions scientific or otherwise
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the end I've worked at De for 23
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
years 11 in my current capacity as a
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
chief of quic
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
biologist over that time I've been
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in tracking cob
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms across the state and
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for the development of our
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
current program uh that monitors and
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
reports on Sono bacteria blooms I can
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
say without hesitation that uh CYO
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
bacteria currently represent one of the
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
greatest threats to our surface waters
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh to date
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
we have blooms on 122 uh water bodies
 
01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
that have been documented uh each of
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
these water bodies have had a warning
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
issued uh which restricts uh Recreation
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
advisory is advisories are issued or
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
Warnings are issued protect the public
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh pets and livestock from the toxins
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
that cyob bacteria can
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
produce warnings typically last about 25
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
days but as we saw this summer uh some
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
of them last over a 100 days so they can
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
last Almost the majority of the
 
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.270 align:start position:0%
last Almost the majority of the
recreational

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
season during that time our department
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
recommends against the use of the water
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
body for recreation and in certain cases
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
when they occur on Public Water Supplies
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
there can be uh concern relative to the
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
uses of the water body for water supply
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
use in response to the increased
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
prevalence in severity of Soo bacteria
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
blooms over the last several years as I
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned the uh the
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
department completed a Statewide cyob
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
bacteria management plan uh that was
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
done in conjunction with a cyob bacteria
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
advisory committee the plan outlines
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
several strategies recommended by the
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
department to reduce and control C on
 
01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:43.550 align:start position:0%
department to reduce and control C on
bacteria

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
bacteria
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
blooms as a primary author of that
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
report it was clear from the outside
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
that the reduction of nutrient inputs
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
needed to be one of the primary
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
strategies included in that plan
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
nutrients specifically phosphorus are
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of the most important factors that
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
cause cob bacteria plumes and represent
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we can control with
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
respect to factors that really influence
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
the occurrence of Sino bacteria Bloom
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
specifically the report recommends the
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
expansion of the clean Lakes program
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
which is under RSA 47 again as an
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
important component of the strategy to
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
reduce nutrients in our surface water a
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about the clean
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
Lakes program it was enacted in 1990
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
specifically specifically states that it
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
shall function to limit the utopic
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
process which is the speeding up of Lake
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
aging which is primary done primarily
 
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
done through the addition of nutrients
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
to reduce uh nutrient grow or nuisance
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
growth of macron which is plants quatic
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
plants and phytol plon which includes
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria phytol plon is just algae
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and cyanobacteria for a long time are
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
classified as an algae further statute
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
states that uh its purpose is to
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
diagnose degraded lakes and Implement
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
long-term solutions to restoring water
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
quality which I think is consistent with
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh what this uh proposed legislation
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
recommends it also uh States as a
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
purpose to provide short-term remedial
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
actions which can effectively maintain
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
water quality conditions for adequate
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
adequate for public Recreation enjoyment
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
over the past 20 years most of you
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
probably know this the state the statute
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
has focused exclusively on the
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
management of invasive aquatic species
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
primarily plants with exceptional
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
success um however the statute clearly
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
identifies that the restoration and
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
preservation of projects that control
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
reduce incoming nutrients that also be
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
considered including watershed
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
management planning which representative
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
rung previously spoke about the proposed
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
changed would further emphasize the need
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
to monitor manage and reduce the risk of
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
cob bacteria blooms specifically as part
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
statute additionally the proposed
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
legislation directs the department to
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
control the level phosphorus using in
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
Lake management techniques where
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
possible and based on sound science it's
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
not something that we uh um expect to be
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
doing on a regular case but or a regular
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
basis but we do know that there will be
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
certain instances where it's
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
necessary the department feels that the
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
proposed change is an important step in
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
adding updated policies and practices
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
that will facilitate the understanding
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
and reducing the amount of phosphorus
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
loading into laks played by cynobacteria
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
blooms and that is consistent with the
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
cynobacteria plan
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
we are pleased to see that the
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
legislators considering uh one of these
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations of the plan if
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
passed it will compliment the use of
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
current funding available in the cob
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
bacteria mitigation loan and Grant fund
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
that was established in
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
2022 importantly it also establishes a
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
framework for the future use of
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
additional funds that may become
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
available through specific uh specific
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
to reducing phosphorus loading to lakes
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
and remediating CER bacteria
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
blooms I can't stress enough that the
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
management of cyanobacteria in our
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
surface waters is a complex problem that
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
requires multifaceted approach the
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
current legislation if passed is an
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
important step in expanding the tools
 
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we have in our toolbox to to reduce
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
the occurrence and severity of sinob
 
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.910 align:start position:0%
the occurrence and severity of sinob
bacteria

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
blooms I want to also uh uh note that we
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
are recommending that or we're also
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
supportive the language that
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative rung uh suggests it will
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
be introduced as an amendment uh one
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
which would give the the authority to
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
develop rules under RSA 47 colon 24 and
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
those rules would be specific to
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
implementing in Lake management projects
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
our current process is not perfect um
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the use or the development of
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
specific rules designed to uh manage
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
such projects would be uh greatly
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
enhanced the current rules that we use
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
are really designed for surface water
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
discharges similar to what we you would
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
be familiar with with wastewater
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and this is is quite a
 
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.629 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and this is is quite a
different

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
situation um we also are supportive of
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
the specific language which uh will be
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
introduced in the amendment with regards
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
to fishing the fishing game department
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
we feel like the fishing game department
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
is an important partner in any uh large
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
scale in Lake treatment project that we
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
would Undertake and in fact we're
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
currently considering an in Lake
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
treatment project uh for particular Lake
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
in this in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
and one of the first calls that we made
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
was to reach out to fishing game we've
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
already undertaken some consultation
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
with them in that
 
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
matter and that's all I have I'm happy
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
to answer all of your scientific
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions to the best of my ability um
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
so I welcome any of those questions
 
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:41.590 align:start position:0%
so I welcome any of those questions
thank

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh Erin Holmes you wish to say anything
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
or you're you're there you're there to
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're there to watch
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.870 align:start position:0%
you're there to watch
it

01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um I have uh one one question
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see a any uh money associated
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
with this yet it says it's effective
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
date is 60 days after
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
passage uh do you have money or do you
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
just put this put out a 10 cup
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
to I mean where's where where's the
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
money coming from and who who pays
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's an excellent question Mr
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
chair and uh one that you know we we've
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
anticipated um we there are monies
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
available now in the cyto bacteria
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation Loan Fund and the rules that
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
were just passed um we anticipate that
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
those funds would be one of the primary
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that we would utilize to uh
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
Fund in Lake treatment projects this
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
particular uh proposed legislation goes
 
01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
goes a bit further and establishes a
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
framework for uh further developing the
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
clean Lakes program and would also offer
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunities should there be
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
additional funding offered in the future
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
or proposed in the future to uh allow
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
that funding to be included here so um
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating any specific
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
funds relative to this particular
 
01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and we anticipate using the
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
available ask my I'll ask myself if I
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
can have another question yes I think I
 
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
can have another question yes I think I
will

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh is this uh uh is the money coming
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
just from uh Dees or is this a shared
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility with the folks who will
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
benefit from it which are those who live
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
around the
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
lake uh I I guess I your question is
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
this relative to the cyob baceria
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund yes yes um right now the
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
way the the rules are set up and
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
established there is no uh required
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
match to uh to to receive those funds
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
however we would anticipate as we review
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
projects that there would be a large
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
amount of work in in advance of that
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
that would require a significant
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
investment by the entities living around
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
or benefiting from the particular
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
project thank you any uh questions by
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
anyone from the uh
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee so you all know the science
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
right good fantastic what else do you
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
know ah good
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm still hung up on
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
this more of a better word messing with
 
01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:49.310 align:start position:0%
this more of a better word messing with
Mother

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
Mother
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
Nature I look back 20 odd years years
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
ago when we said oh we're going to put a
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
conservation easement on the headwaters
 
01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.189 align:start position:0%
conservation easement on the headwaters
land

01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
14 140,000 Acres it's going to be there
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the loggers are going to continue
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
Etc we never understood about carbon
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
credits the world has
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
changed and I wonder whether this
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
treatment of the phosphorus that's
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
naturally occurred is there are we doing
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
it maybe because we want pretty water
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
for people that live around the
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
lake it's a concern that I have Mr chair
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I just don't have an answer yet
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative wolf I truly appreciate
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
your question and in fact uh a lot of
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
times when I work with my colleagues in
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
the department uh we have received a lot
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
of requests to improve water quality
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
conditions in the lake and one of the
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
first things we say to ourselves is our
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds are not pools um if
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
people are expecting a pool condition
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
they should go install a pool on their
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
property enjoy a pool um the the
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
question that you posed uh earlier to
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative rung and the one I think
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
you're sort of similarly asking here is
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
when we review the conditions in a water
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
body we consider what its historical
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
state is or was and we do that by
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the uh prior um
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
reports that were done on trophic
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
classification that's sort of sets the
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
threshold by which we expect a water
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
body to behave and the water quality to
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
um to exhibit um so that's kind of the
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
the expectation that we have it's not
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
one that we feel is
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and we also know that as I
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously nutrients are one
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have the ability
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
to control the amount of nutrients that
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
go into a lake uh whether it be
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
internally or
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
externally I want to address one other
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
component of um an earlier discussion
 
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
which was relative to where the
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
nutrients come from we know that bottom
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
sediments and lakes represent the
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
activities or Legacy activities of the
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh landscape in the past and uh we have
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
no control over things that have
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the past however we do uh
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
reap the the uh consequences of those
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
activities from the past and what we're
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
seeing now is uh a buildup of nutrients
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
that are either have occurred over time
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
and are being contributed uh currently
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
in in the current state um we can't
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
control temperature your question was an
 
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
excellent one we do know that water
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
temperatures are increasing in our
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
surface waters around the state but we
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
can control the amount of nutrients that
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
are entering either from external
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
sources you're
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone else representative Darby
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
my question um I'll ask the same qu uh
 
01:24:59.109 --> 01:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
your interpretation of the same question
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
I asked representative Rome on uh you
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
know on section four or um the new
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
section four of the um you
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
know what this line line 19 and 20 um
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know it says the department is
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
directed to reduce control and prevent
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
the nutrient inputs causing C bacteria
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
so to me like that's super broad but
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
then it's super restricts it and says
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
education um and education and
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
engagement as well as you know the the
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
thing we're talking about now the you
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
know treating the likes so I like your
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of like how did um what
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
does you know the the headline in
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
subsection four cover and then what does
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
it mean to work with for example the
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations or um or others to
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
provide sort of comprehensive
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
reduction that's a pretty large question
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you very much
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
um the this the proposal as written uh
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
the way we understand it uh is expanding
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
the current uh clean Lakes program such
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we could address cob bacteria
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
blooms directly calling them amount
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
directly um as a problem and and
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing as a problem and setting a
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
framework by which nutrients become the
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
focus to reduce the causes of C bacteria
 
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
blooms which as i' mentioned is the one
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
thing we actually have the ability to
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
control um personally I think there's
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
there's additional work to be done in
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
RSA 47 itself for a variety of reasons
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a statute that has been
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
built upon over time I I don't think
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
this would be the last time you would
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
see a request to make changes to RSA 47
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
but this is a starting point and uh
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
places a spotlight on its uh focus on
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
cob bacteria blooms and expanding it
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh the management of invasive
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
aquatic species and I I really think
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
that Lake management includes a holistic
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
Lakes

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so um you know I ALS was
 
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of when that question was first
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
asked to representative brang um we have
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs already within our
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
group and within the Watershed Bureau
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are focused on that external load
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
reduction um there are funding sources
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
available as well through the federal
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
clean water srf program and so over the
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
years we have been focused on the very
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
hyper local level of doing soak up the
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
rain projects with one of our programs
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
to educate Lake owners um how to just
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
manage their own runoff to reduce
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
nutrient pollution then we start getting
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
up higher and we have funding through
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
the federal um sources to implement
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
larger Watershed projects that are
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
really geared towards these best
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
management practices and so we are
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
already doing that um and then in the
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation fund the recent
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
rules really establish two Pathways if
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be doing an external
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
load Reduction Program or project and
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
then that internal and what I quick
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
learned when I took took on this role is
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
calls come into to Dave all summer of
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
how do we fix the problem we've got
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and we haven't had this
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
clear pathway and that's really a lot of
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
what this new legislation establishes is
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
how do we work with somebody who has or
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
in Watershed Association that has spent
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
the time to reduce their external
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
nutrient loads they've done the sediment
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
sampling as representative rang
 
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned they know there's an internal
 
01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.510 align:start position:0%
mentioned they know there's an internal
problem

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
and so that's sort of where things have
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
stopped because we don't have clear
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
Authority we are jamming a square peg in
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
a round hole with permitting these types
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
of projects and so this really helps
 
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
open the door of the now what can we do
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and it gives us that ability to be
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
engaged in that process very early on
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
with these associations whom we likely
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
have already been working on to reduce
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
all their external loads over time so as
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
Dave mentioned it's a very complex
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
project it's not one size fits every
 
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
Lake and the department with the
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
programs we already have in place are
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
very involved with these associations
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
from the get-go and so we're not getting
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
to in Lake treatment lightly there's a
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
lot of work that goes in there and it's
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
not applicable to every water body
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
either um and so having this ability
 
01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:43.719 align:start position:0%
having the ability to permit a project
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
puts us at the table with this and to be
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
able to make decisions that are
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate that are good for the water
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
quality good for the water body and that
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you um and thank you for
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'm just wondering if
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
you could expand a little bit about the
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
health impacts on on humans um I know we
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess the you know is it just as
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
simple as saying stay out of the water
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
and then that's the only you know health
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
impact that we could have on on
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
populations living there or is it are
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
there you know chronic conditions from
 
01:30:21.239 --> 01:30:22.870 align:start position:0%
there you know chronic conditions from
exposure

01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
um that could
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
be C you know the the local population
 
01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:28.430 align:start position:0%
be C you know the the local population
could

01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
see yeah thank you very much I
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
um the the simple answer to your
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
question that we try to strive to tell
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
people is uh when in doubt stay out so
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's a very consistent message that
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
resonates with a lot of people so we ask
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
them to uh do this sort of self-risk
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
assessment when they're uh standing at
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
the shore of of a water body deciding
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
whether they want to recreate in it
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
whether it be swimming fishing paddling
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
um what have you uh the the real answer
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
to your question is the the toxicity of
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
cyob bacteria is real um it's not
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
something that uh is is meant to scare
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
people uh the effects are real they
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
range from short-term acute symptoms to
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
gastrointestinal discomfort um but they
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
can they serve as a neurotoxin so they
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
can be very severe and we've seen deaths
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
of dogs um in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
across the the country um some of the
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
work that we've shown in our cyob
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
bacteria plan about 50% to 2third of the
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
samples that we tested from 2022 had
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
detectable levels of cyanotoxins in them
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
risk any other
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions I have one additional uh this
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
is specifically this bill specifically
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
is for
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
in inl additions Pro it's an inl program
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with well it has it
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
has it has nothing to do with septic
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
systems uh if there is something else
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
around septic systems around Lakes my
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that I don't want to see
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
this as the camel's nose in the
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
tent for to you as as I want to see this
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh become
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
a a method of controlling the septic
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
tank on the top of the mountain when
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's 100 miles away from the lakes
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so is
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
there you is this what exactly this is
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
only about the Alum you can add to the
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
to the water right is that what the this
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
bill is for or is or you feel as there's
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
there is pressure to be able or there
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
you now can go and say well this is also
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
we uh we when we get involved with the
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan maybe this
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
gives us a chance to take care of all of
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
those septic tanks out there even though
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere near a
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
lake I focus on lakes I'm our assistant
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
division director Mr deers who also has
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
oversight of some of the inl I me I mean
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
you're let him answer this question okay
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then I'll sit back down to
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
answer any of the questions they have
 
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:35.950 align:start position:0%
answer any of the questions they have
okay

01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
you may it please the committee my uh
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
name is Ted deers I'm the assistant
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division at the
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh and I'm I'd
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
love to answer that question
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
Mr sh uh the fact of the matter is is
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
that this the way we view this and I
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
think the way that this legislation is
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
written is it it is coordinating
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislation the same way that the Clean
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
Water Act clean water program clean
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
Lakes program sorry is coordinating
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
legislation for aquatic invasives it
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
basically when it comes to things like
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
nutrients it's saying okay if we have a
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
problem there's lots of different
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
programs at Dees currently which can be
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
brought to bear to fix this program
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
without expanding The Authority
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria so if you look I think if
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
you read carefully this legislation it
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
truly is coordinating identifying that
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
there's a single place where if you have
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
this problem there's a group of people
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have funding through the general fund
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
for certain positions we have funding
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
through other programs that are coming
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
in that fund this work there's the clean
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
or the uh the the the Lakes uh loan
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
program the cyanobacteria loan and grant
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
program that was created all of these
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
things kind of come together as part of
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation in no way do we see and
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly I don't believe that this
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
Administration would support an
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
expansion of regulatory Authority uh on
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh by virtue of this particular program
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is a program dedicated and that's
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
why I think where you see some of the
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
words that I think representative Darby
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
brought to bear is that it is focused on
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
science it is focused on the monitoring
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
and then it's focused on the
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
coordination so yes inlay treatments the
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
reason why there's some focus on that is
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a doughnut hole a little
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
bit in currently the way we do things
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to piece it together to be
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to do this this makes a clear
 
01:35:39.629 --> 01:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
pathway for that particular practice
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
that it currently is a muddled uh
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
pathway so but I think to get right at
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
the the the qu the question is is that
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh again our Administration would not
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
support an expansion of author Authority
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
that would allow the kinds of things
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
that you're suggesting um might might
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
happen and and I I again we have lots of
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
other authorities that you all oversee
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
quite capably related to our septic
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
system regulations our Shoreland
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
regulations our Wetland regulations if
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
there was an expansion of authority that
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
would be coming to you thank any other
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee if not will you fill out a c
 
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
committee if not will you fill out a c
please

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
much uh this
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
Andrea uh
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
Lakes good morning uh chair and Zulo and
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Andrea
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
lamro president of New Hampshire lakes
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
and I am here to support this bill uh
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes we're a Statewide
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization we represent
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
about 275 Lake Associations um and I
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
know you've heard from many of them um
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
signing in in in support of this bill um
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
you have heard from the experts um and I
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
would say congratulations um I learned
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
about internal loading when I was in
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
graduate school um so you um may have a
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
graduate degree going here um but we
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill for all the reasons uh
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
that Aon and Dave and representative
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
Rong um shared with you we New Hampshire
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
Lakes are based uh a group based in
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
science and we have full trust in Dees
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
that they are going to stick to um
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
science and and not um let this you know
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
do overreach and get into other topics
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is is um sorely needed here in New
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cyano bacteria uh we need a
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
better way a more streamlined way a more
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
direct path to managing it in the lake
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
when and where it's appropriate uh we
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Lake
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
Associations um and I we work in New
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes we work with Lake
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
Associations to reduce the amount of
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
nutrients coming off the landscape we
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
run our lak smart Lake friendly Living
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
Program and there's a lot of work being
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
done um in a lot of communities to
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the external loading um and
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know that's not enough um
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so again we have full trust in Dees
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
to come up with a process um that is is
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward efficient and
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
scientifically appropriate to deal with
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh these blooms that we all as as humans
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
on the land on the landscape have um
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
contributed to so I urge you to support
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and um would happy to be happy
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
questions is there any questions by
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you very much
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
you have no more pink cards I want to
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
say one thing uh this uh bill is
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
probably is coming forth based on the
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
plan that was put together uh on cyano
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
bacteria at the behest of this committee
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
so uh we you know it it is so we're the
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
we're actually the Foster of it and they
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
did a fantastic job putting that plan
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
together and I by the way I think I sent
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
it out to everybody but I think uh
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
probably representative rung and myself
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
are the only ones who've read
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
it oh you too thank you very
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.669 align:start position:0%
it oh you too thank you very
much

01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%

Nashville ward 3 um and I also uh chair
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
the Nashville Conservation Commission
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
um so this bill came about from my
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
experience on the nashille Conservation
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
Commission as an urban Conservation
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
Commission we are asked to rule on tree
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
cutting in Wetland buffers many of the
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
homes in NASA were built in the 50s 60s
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and 7s before Wetland ordinances were
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
tightened up in some cases we have seen
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
houses built in what is now considered a
 
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.390 align:start position:0%
houses built in what is now considered a
wetland

02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
buffer knowledgeable and responsible
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
home homeowners know that before any
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
tree cutting can occur in a wetland
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
buffer they need to submit an
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
application to their Conservation
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and have a determination made
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
as to how many and where trees can be
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
cut one problem is that as homes are
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
sold the next owner doesn't necessarily
 
02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
know about these ordinances in most
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
cases when they call a responsible Tree
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
Service Company they are notified of a
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
possible problem and and directed to
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
call their municipal office for guidance
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
prior to trees being cut in other cases
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Tree Service Company Logging company
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
or other tree cutting entity withhold
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
this information and protect themselves
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
by placing in the fine print a notice
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
that the landowner is responsible for
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
all P permitting as we all know it is
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
rare for any of us to go over a contract
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
line by line especially the fine print
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
in urban settings when illegal cutting
 
02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
occurs someone usually makes an inquiry
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
to the city or registers a complaint
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
this happens at the time of tree cutting
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
so the damage to the Wetland is done and
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
the landowner is on the hook for
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
mitigation costs HB 1208 addresses this
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
problem by mandating that any tree
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
cutting service logger or other entity
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
cutting trees must ask the landowner to
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
see the approval permits and place
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
copies in their files if the homeowner
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have paperwork indicating an
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
approval to cut the tree cutting service
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
logger or entity must advise the
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
landowner on the process of
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
obtaining uh of obtaining the permits in
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
the qu in the case of a questionable cut
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and they can't provide copies of the
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
permits they could be fined per uh RSA
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
482 d a uh colon 13 the Nashville
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission has explored
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
other ways to protect Wetlands but none
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
have been feasible Realtors are not
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
interested in being responsible for
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
informing potential buyers that there
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
could be restrictions on the land and
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
markers don't work since they are costly
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
um require uh surveyors and boundaries
 
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee Mr representative
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair I thank you
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question is
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
there a specific case in nashille that
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
comes to mind that sort of um make you
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
point uh yes there were actually uh I've
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
been on the Conservation Commission
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
since I believe 2013 or
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
2014 um there's been three that I've
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
known of one I'm trying to think three
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
or four um one when I came on there was
 
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
one during my time um and uh we we just
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
mitigated one um at this past session
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh and that's basically the reason
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
why this came out uh this was the first
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner um who was uh
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
I mean it was obvious that he was
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
unaware that there were any
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
regulations um a couple of the trees
 
02:05:31.229 --> 02:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
were cut within a foot 2 feet um of um
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
Salmon Brook which is I think a third
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
order stream okay so so I mean anybody
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the tree cutting business would have
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
known I mean I mean it was so obvious
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I think he took down 20 or 22 trees
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
and all of them were in the Wetland
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
buffer um so the home home owner was
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
really unaware of the ordinances um
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
ended up working with us ended up giving
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
me the name of the company and um and
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we went through um the city
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
I went through the city to say I mean
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
how could this be done and that's when I
 
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
found out that um these tree cutting
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
services will come in um they charge the
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner they sell the wood uh they
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
already know before they cut it how much
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to get on the market for
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
it and they protect them M themselves
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
because in the fine print it says that
 
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:06:25.069 --> 02:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
responsible um you know for any
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
permitting and that's responsible the
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
landowner in the one previous case that
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
I can remember um it was a family that
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
had just moved in from
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh having sold a house
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
that abutted conservation land they had
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
a logger come in and take down I don't
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
know 20 or 30 trees in the Wetland
 
02:06:48.239 --> 02:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
know 20 or 30 trees in the Wetland
buffer

02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
buffer
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't remember the name of
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
the logger um they couldn't remember I
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean I guess the truck just came out one
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
day and cut down 20 trees and they
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
didn't know who it was um and um you
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
know they were very uncooperative and it
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
was clear in that case um because of
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
where the cutting was is is that the
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
Hope was that they could improve um they
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
had a small backyard and they wanted to
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
enlarge the backyard so they had the
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
or followup thank you Mr chair and and
 
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
did you say the homeowner is on the hook
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
for uh fines related to that in these
 
02:07:32.189 --> 02:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
cases uh not necessarily fines but for
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
mitigation so so for example when you
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know I mean per the wet Wetland
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
ordinances in Nashua um if you uh
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
illegally remove uh cut trees or
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
illegally remove um uh Native shrubs or
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
whatever from a wetland buffer then uh
 
02:07:56.109 --> 02:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
you uh have to mitigate that um and
 
02:07:58.549 --> 02:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
mitigating it you know so it comes uh
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
before the Conservation Commission and
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
then we make a determination of what the
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner you know has to do um in this
 
02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
case uh it would you know I mean he was
 
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
he was very concerned about it but I
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe see I believe the um he was
 
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
charged $4,500 to take on the trees and
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
I believe we've estimated his mitigation
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
cost at possibly another
 
02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
$5,000 so I mean you know depending on
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
how extensive it is it can be you know
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
really substantial
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
donelly thank you Mr thank you the chair
 
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
do you know if there is an education
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
program for tree cutting services so
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
they can actually go in and and
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
understand when they're evaluating um a
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
project if there is Wetlands if there's
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
not Wetlands is there any and I know DS
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
here for this question maybe but is
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
there any programs for them to be taking
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
so that they're aware of this ahead of
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
time I I hate to make assumptions on
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
whether they know or not know yeah well
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know you have the uh you you have
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
organizations um that they can they can
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
belong to if they choose so I mean BAS
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
basically what we see is you have
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
reputable arborus who belong to what is
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
it the um New Hampshire tree Association
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
I I believe that's the name of it they
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
have ongoing um uh you know education
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
courses on on all kinds of things um so
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
yeah what what we have you know and it
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
was interesting in in this last case I
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
went up on their website and you need so
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
you go on an arur website and and you
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
know you you can see that they're a
 
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
certified Arborist okay and you say okay
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
well you know they probably know what
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing in this last case they had
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
links to what a certified Arborist does
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay or is but there was nothing on the
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
site that led you to believe that
 
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
anybody on their staff was a certified
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
Arborist and I believe in the in the
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
state I mean you know I mean I can go
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
out and cut trees I could take my
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
chainsaw put a sign on a truck and go
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
out and cut trees as far as I know so um
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
they can be educated uh you know this
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
the the last company has been B in
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
business for a long time very hard for
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
me to believe that a company that's been
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
cutting trees for a long time doesn't
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
know that when the tree is a foot from
 
02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
the water's edge
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
that there might be a problem so so we
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's really the
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
Rogue um it's it's really a a way I mean
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
what it's two things you have the
 
02:11:02.189 --> 02:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
homeowners who really don't care they
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
just want to get the trees cut down and
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know and they don't care so they
 
02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
hire anybody or everybody but you really
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
have you know caring unsuspecting I mean
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
it would just be like any of us here if
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
I hired somebody to put in an
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
you know a new furnace for me and you're
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
hiring a responsible company that's been
 
02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
in business for a long time you know you
 
02:11:31.069 --> 02:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
don't expect to find out you know 6
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
months later that you didn't get a
 
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
permit I mean how would you know you
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
know I mean you expect and and we've had
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
situations where a homeowner has wanted
 
02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
to take wanted to replace a shed uh in a
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
wetland buffer and um Hills fair was it
 
02:11:52.589 --> 02:11:52.599 align:start position:0%
is it Hills fairy Reeds fairy so Reeds
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
fairy came out looked at it and said you
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
know you should contact your
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission you're in a
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
wetland buffer and um and you may need
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
an approval so I mean that's what
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
reputable companies do but you know a
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
lot of times the company looks reputable
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
especially in this business they have
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
trucks they have cranes they look you
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
know um but this the homeowner gets
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
blindsided and I don't think it's a
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
stretch to ask a um a reputable business
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
um to just ask the homeowner have you
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
received do you you know do you know
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
that this could Wetland rules could
 
02:12:33.390 --> 02:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
apply so why don't you call your
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
municipality and just check and we've
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
had situations where that's happened and
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
the um department manager has called me
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
and said you know Sherry I mean I think
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's an issue where it's borderline I
 
02:12:50.669 --> 02:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to do anything about
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
it I feel comfortable with the homeowner
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
going ahead with this and we say fine
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
other times we get an application you
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
know and that's that's the other thing
 
02:13:01.629 --> 02:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
you know I mean they have to pay for the
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
application so people who follow the
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
rules you know will come to us and then
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
we'll do a site visit and then we'll
 
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate because we recognize you know
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
I mean you know we recognize they bought
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
a house you know they have some um I you
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
know ideas about it and so we negotiate
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
and say okay well if you do this we
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
would like you to plant some native
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
plants here you know and work with them
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
to you know maintain the habitat and the
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
so any other question representative
 
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
harb thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I appreciate
 
02:13:44.830 --> 02:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
your comments regarding
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
owners but I read the um bill and I
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't see anywhere in the bill that
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
exempts the owner from the mitigation
 
02:13:56.350 --> 02:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
requirements that it gives him a
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
whitewash like as long as he hires
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
somebody then he doesn't have to worry
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
about it it just says the person cutting
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
or doing the work needs to verify the
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
permitting but it it's not an exemption
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
for the owner for that
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation am I missing
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
something well you mean that there might
 
02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
be mate right I mean the
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
homeowner uh may
 
02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
still the Conservation Commission may
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
still ask the
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
homeowner um at that point probably not
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation because you're talking about
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
two different things so we see this is
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
this usually comes to us as code
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement the trees have already been
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
cut down the damage has been done it's
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
code enforcement so now the Conservation
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
Commission can can really say to them
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know you need to do this okay on the
 
02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
other hand people who follow the rules
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh provide us with an application so
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's before and they say Okay I want
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
to cut down six trees because I'm
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
getting older this was the case and um
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I don't always want to uh
 
02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
have uh pine needles and pine limbs to
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
you know to rake up so we go out we look
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
at the property and we'd say to them
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay we we can't allow you to cut down
 
02:15:26.669 --> 02:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
six eight trees but we can have you cut
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
down two or three trees that might be
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
leaning against the house they they
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
might be a danger you know at that point
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
we make a suggestion you know what you
 
02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
might want to do um you know for
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
drainage issues into the the Wetland you
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
know you might want to plant some bushes
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
or something like that but they're not
 
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
it's not mandated at that point um
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
because they've come to us prior they've
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
gotten our approval and you know we
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
really do try we really do try to work
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
with people you know I mean that that's
 
02:16:01.870 --> 02:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
the whole issue
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
with you know with the conflict between
 
02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
Wildlife the environment and you know um
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:18.390 align:start position:0%

02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.510 align:start position:0%

repres

02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
repres
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative wolf then representative
 
02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
Derby I don't
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
see that you should be taking this off
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the homeowner the homeowner is the
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
one that you
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
have enforcement against that should
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
have done everything in accordance with
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
your rules in the city of nashor for
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
wetlands um you know and if somebody
 
02:16:49.389 --> 02:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
builds a ship in there it's not the guy
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
that built the shed that even didn't
 
02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
truck it that sold it out of the lot at
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh Home Depot it's the homeowner and I
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in here that's that's
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
um going after the homeowner who's
 
02:17:08.669 --> 02:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
benefiting from The
 
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
Cutting oh representative the the whole
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
point is prevention okay so you you
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
can't prevent an a problem if you're not
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
educated about it okay and what we're
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
saying I mean especially in nashwa I
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know how many homes we have
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
sold in a month but probably close to
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
well maybe not like this week but I mean
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
at the at the height of the Season you
 
02:17:36.629 --> 02:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
know you're probably talking a couple
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
thousand or maybe a thousand homes a
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
month that that turn over okay and uh
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
and people don't know so all this bill
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
does is force um a tree cutting service
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
to educate the
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
homeowner that a um permit may be
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
required if the homeowner says I don't
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to get a permit cut the trees down
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
and I'll take my chances they can still
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
do that but then it becomes code
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement and now they've got a
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
problem okay so so this is really just
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
notifying a
 
02:18:21.629 --> 02:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
homeowner that they need this permit it
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
would be no different than let's say If
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
you hired a construction company and
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
they said okay before I can build this
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh you need a building permit and you
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
say oh okay I didn't know that I just
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know change the windows in
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
my garage or something no you need a
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
building permit okay do you get it or do
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
I get it no you have to get it that
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
that's basically all it
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
so it's the homeowner's responsibility
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
then because they're going to have to
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
get a building permit if they hire
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that puts the windows in
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
without a permit do you have to notify
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
should we put a law in place that
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
notifies all the window installers that
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
they have to get a
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
permit well I would assume that when
 
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
you're hiring somebody
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
reputable okay that that they would
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know and all we're trying to do
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
is say
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
reputable this should be absolutely no
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
problem for a reputable tree cutting
 
02:19:35.070 --> 02:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
service or
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
entity it should be no problem at all
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay I mean rather you know I mean they
 
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
expect a check I I just expect a copy of
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
the permit okay so it's no problem um
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
and for those that want to you know that
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
are not reputable and find it profitable
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
to cut trees in a in a wetland um you
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
price representative uh Derby thank you
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you for taking my
 
02:20:10.990 --> 02:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
question so I can I can see the
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
conundrum which is that um the you know
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
the homeowner sometimes they don't they
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't know right they just don't know um
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and um people that cut a lot of trees do
 
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
do know I'm almost done I'm one more
 
02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
second I'm I'm almost at the question um
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
so but the the problem is that I that
 
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to ask about is that the
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner um this puts the burden on
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
getting the permit on the entity cutting
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
the trees no that's that's the way I'm
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
reading it in four 4 A
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
um shall the agent or contractor shall
 
02:20:53.230 --> 02:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
verify compliance with all permitting
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
documents yeah all they have to do is
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
ask that they are not responsible for
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
the permitting they are responsible for
 
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
asking the
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
homeowner did you this is a questionable
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
situation you know have you gotten the
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
approval of your municipality your town
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
or your Conservation Commission and if
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
so can you show me the letter that I can
 
02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
so can you show me the letter that I can
copy

02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
copy
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
they they don't have to do the
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
permitting at all if
 
02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:24.030 align:start position:0%
permitting at all if
you

02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so all they have to do is get the
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
permit they have to see the permit and
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
file yeah so you know so prior to any
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
person or entity commencing Timber
 
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
harvesting operations in Wetlands as
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
described in paragraphs one or two okay
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
including an agent of or contractor for
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
a landowner the person or entity shall
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
verify compliance with all permitting so
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is verify
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
compliance it's still the land owner the
 
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
permits I mean if you find that to be um
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
confusing you know we can tighten it up
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
but the intent was that the
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the
 
02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
landowner and the entity's only
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to verify you know in
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know I mean if I'm having a tree cut
 
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
in my front yard that's no big deal but
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
I mean you know if you're walking into
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
an area and your shoes are getting
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
wet you know or you're you know cutting
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
cting a tree 2 feet or a foot from the
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
stream most tree cutting services who
 
02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.270 align:start position:0%
stream most tree cutting services who
are

02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
experienced understand that that could
 
02:22:58.510 --> 02:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
issue is there any other question
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative run thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
question to my understanding it seems
 
02:23:10.990 --> 02:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
like it is common practice for
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
contractors that are doing work near um
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
a Wetlands or a water body for instance
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
if someone is having a dock replaced or
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
a deck replaced near water that the
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
contractor is aware that permits are
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
required so is that to me I mean do you
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
find it unusual that someone doing work
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
near a regulated area would be aware
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
like they I think they would ask the
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
tree cutter would say oh you know you
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to get a permit for this sometimes
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
they offer to get the permit perit for
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
the homeowner question is I'm sorry so
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
do you find that unusual that they um
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
that the person doing the work wouldn't
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
required It's Not Unusual for
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
um an how do I want to say this if
 
02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're a
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
reputable um tree cutting service you
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
have arborus on staff or whatever um
 
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
it's not problem they they would do that
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
but you know trust me I mean they have
 
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
to be out there and I assume it you know
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
in rural areas it probably happens a lot
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
but I mean and they're not I I would
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
call them a fly by night but they're not
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
a a fly by night I mean that's their
 
02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
business you know I mean they I mean
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
they see an area of pristine trees along
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
a wetland that you know haven't been
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
touched for I don't know 50 75 100 years
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
and you know they might be what 30 40
 
02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
feet tall nice and straight they don't
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
have any dings in them from golf balls
 
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
or frisbees or anything else and you
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
know there's a profit motive in there
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
let me cut them down and uh sell them on
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
the on the market um so you know so you
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
are going to have companies um that know
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
what the regulations are know what they
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
should be doing but the profit motive
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
overcomes it and th and those are the
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
Bad actors that were trying to um you
 
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.230 align:start position:0%
Bad actors that were trying to um you
know

02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
penalize or a followup okay so with this
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill though when you're talking about
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Bad actors then this bill because of
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements and the
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
records retention uh component would
 
02:25:42.030 --> 02:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
provide that accountability okay thank
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
youil for
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
question yes so I just um representative
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you for taking my question
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
and for coming in today um would you say
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
that if a waiver is in the contract in
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
other words if the person is I'm I have
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
a tree service and Suzanne's Tree
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
Service um has this thing where at the
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
bottom there's a disclaimer that says if
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have the permits or if you
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
wait a
 
02:26:15.870 --> 02:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
minute it's up to you you're 100% liable
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
then they would know that there's
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
liability for taking down trees in the
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
Wetland area so for me it's like we're
 
02:26:26.269 --> 02:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
talking about do people does the tree
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
service know what they're
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
doing to me if if you sign a contract
 
02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
and you write somebody a check and that
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
contract says that you're responsible
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
for picking up any permits that are
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
necessary and they just let go of it at
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
that that you're the one who's
 
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
responsible that they know there is a
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
respons responsibility and someone has
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
to Bear it so in other words we can't
 
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
say that a tree service wouldn't know if
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
then fact they are putting it in their
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
contract that they know that you should
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
have these permanence do that com
 
02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
have these permanence do that com
out

02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well you know I mean that that's an
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
i another way to handle the issue um
 
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
they have a disclaimer that says we are
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
not responsible but you know I mean you
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
could modify it to say that all quotes I
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
mean because they have to quote you know
 
02:27:26.429 --> 02:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
I mean you have to have a paper quote
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
when you ask somebody to come in and you
 
02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
know so you could also do something
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
where all quotes at the bottom you know
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
must have a
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
notification that permits may be um
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
required before the work can be done uh
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
and then you know please contact us
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
please contact your municipality or
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
something like that so that could be an
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
another way of handling it um you know
 
02:27:58.030 --> 02:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
although a lot of the Bad actors what
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
they basically and you know um this is
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
why homeowners will take them up on it
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
they'll come in and they'll say we'll
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
cut the trees for
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
nothing okay so I mean there's not even
 
02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.670 align:start position:0%
nothing okay so I mean there's not even
a

02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
quote in involved we'll cut the trees
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
for nothing because they know that that
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
they can sell it and the homeown owner
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
is thinking gee you know i' be nice to
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
be able to have more open space you know
 
02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
and en large my backyard and then they
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
end up planting
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
grass you know and um non-native plants
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh in a wetland or on the Bo on the edge
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
of a wetland or in a wetland and that's
 
02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
not what we
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
want thank you so much for
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying anyone else I I do have a
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
question myself what what uh what is
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
just the setback uh on your yeah um
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
let's see for uh Prime wet lens it's 75
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
ft and for critical wet lenss it's 40
 
02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
and then you know then we have I think
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
20 ft for other wet lenss that are less
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
than I don't know less than three
 
02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
between 3,000 and 9,000 square F feet or
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
something like
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
that but what for the for what we talk
 
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
about it would be either a 40 foot
 
02:29:18.910 --> 02:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
40 foot or 75t and what was the size of
 
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.030 align:start position:0%
40 foot or 75t and what was the size of
the

02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
lot uh well I mean on this on this
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
specific one oh on this specific one I'm
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to say you
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
know maybe about 75 ft of Frontage along
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
Salmon Brook third order stream and the
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
size of the
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
lot pardon then the size of the lot I'm
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
just trying to get an idea of how much
 
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
of the lot was was actually being used
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
by the Wetland by the Wetland
 
02:30:00.510 --> 02:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
set yeah uh well actually so in in this
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
case they had a formal
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
backyard um with a lawn and a fence and
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
a and a wall a and part of
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
um half what was it I think about about
 
02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
half of their backyard was actually in
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
the Wetland okay and that was in place
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
well yeah that so that was illegally
 
02:30:29.230 --> 02:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
done and then from the stone wall uh to
 
02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
the third order
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
stream um I would say in one case it was
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
pretty close like 10 ft um you know so
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
they had the formal backyard that they
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
used and then the natural natural part
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
of it and I think in one case um there
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
was 75t of buffer that was still their
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
yard and that was natural that they
 
02:30:55.469 --> 02:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to convert to Grass to enlarge
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
the yard um but actually where most of
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
the trees were cut down um they um they
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
weren't going
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
to put anything in that area they just
 
02:31:10.990 --> 02:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to improve their
 
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
view okay good for a followup yes uh the
 
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:17.150 align:start position:0%
view okay good for a followup yes uh the
uh

02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:20.429 --> 02:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
uh the these uh setbacks were
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
established after the the houses were
 
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
built well you know I I assume so so uh
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think what conservation commissions
 
02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
came in in what the
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
60s and then and I don't you probably
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
know this better than me I don't know
 
02:31:37.389 --> 02:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
when a lot of the Wetland regulations
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
came in but you know the house was
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
probably built in Theif I'm looking at
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood probably the 50s or
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the 60s okay thank you yeah
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else for a
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
wolf how many cases do you have of this
 
02:31:59.550 --> 02:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
type in a
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
year uh not in a year no I like I say
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
I've been on the Conservation Commission
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
so we've had uh three since I've been
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
there so three in the last 10
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
years okay anyone else seeing none no
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly under the white
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry um so I'm trying to wrap my head
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
around a lot of this because you know
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
the there are a lot of restrictions in
 
02:32:29.309 --> 02:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
in 227 about you know surrounding
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
wetlands and but it seems like there is
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
a bit of a loophole um that I see that
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like you're trying to to get
 
02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that's that the larger operations
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
that require an intent to cut require
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
the person cutting to sign off on a
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
document that says that they understand
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
the rules of cutting in New State of New
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but what we don't have is for
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
those who don't require intent to cut
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
anybody less than 10,000 board feet is
 
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
not required to make that same
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
distinction so you have smaller groups
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
coming in who are cutting less than
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 board feet and then putting it on
 
02:33:01.870 --> 02:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
the homeowner so um is that that am I
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
clear that's the loophole that you're
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
looking to toct right thank you yeah and
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
you know I'm only talking about the
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
Nashville Conservation Commission I mean
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know um when I've I mean I think
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is an issue in other areas
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh of the State uh but I'm not privy to
 
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know and I think also in
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
rural areas it might be a little bit
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
more difficult I mean people may not
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and they don't um
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know they they don't report it
 
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
because it's rural I mean unless you're
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
driving by and you're seeing a a crane
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and you know that that's a river
 
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
undetected any other questions questions
 
02:33:50.269 --> 02:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
it uh Steve
 
02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:14.560 align:start position:0%

Lance chairperson Rula and members of
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Steven

Sherman I am the chief of the New
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau which
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
is part of the division of forest and
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
lands I would like to make the following
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
comments on behalf of the director of
 
02:34:31.389 --> 02:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands Patrick
 
02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hackley um there is also written copies
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
of these
 
02:34:38.190 --> 02:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
statements uh thank you for the
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill 128
 
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
relative to permitting requirements
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
before Timber harvesting operations and
 
02:34:49.710 --> 02:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
Wetland while our agency is tasked with
 
02:34:51.790 --> 02:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws passed by the
 
02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislature we find the bill to be
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
unworkable on several levels and
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
therefore we are opposed to its passage
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands is
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
charged with the execution of all
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%

operations in
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%

02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
four implies that municipalities May
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
impose their own Wetland ordinances
 
02:35:42.670 --> 02:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the state's jurisdiction

under RSA
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
482 a colon 3 paragraph 5 which
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
authorizes the Department of
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and the
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
02:35:57.389 --> 02:35:57.399 align:start position:0%

forestry related Wetland permitting
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%

02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
with the notice of intent to cut wood

notification of forest management
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
activities having minimum Wetlands imp
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
impa with Dees and our agency have
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied the permitting requirements
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
for minimum impact
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
activities the bill is also unclear as
 
02:36:28.590 --> 02:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
to what entity is responsible for
 
02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing the
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
provisions RSA 227 J2 paragraph 1A
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
states that the director and the
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
director's authorized agents shall be
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
the primary enforcement agency for this
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
chapter while the state is not obligated
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
to enforce town ordinances our
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
division's forest Protection Bureau will
 
02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
likely be called upon as few towns have
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
the staff to conduct inspections nor
 
02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
have the statutory authority to enter on
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
to private land this would stretch our
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
staff resources and create confusion
 
02:37:05.630 --> 02:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
within the forestry and landowner
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
communities currently when a landowner
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
files their intent to cut and Forestry
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
notification for minimum Wetlands impact
 
02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
with Dees and our agency they typically
 
02:37:19.269 --> 02:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
can proceed with their management plans
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
within a 15-day time period this bill
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
proposes that a landowner would need to
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
have all state Municipal Wetland permits
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
in hand before commencing their
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
operation potentially causing an
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
administrative delay and adding another
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
impediment to practicing forestry for
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
these reasons we are opposed to House
 
02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:41.190 align:start position:0%
these reasons we are opposed to House
Bill

02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
128 thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
testify um if I can provide any
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
know any questions but members of the
 
02:37:56.429 --> 02:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kelly then
 
02:37:56.439 --> 02:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kelly then
representative

02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
run run then representative Kelly thank
 
02:38:03.790 --> 02:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little confused by the
 
02:38:11.269 --> 02:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
letter because can a homeowner cut down
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
two three eight trees without uh having
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
to file an intent to cut
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
form yes um so with with this when you
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
look at the 227 J laws the their
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
intention is for forestry um and and
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
while sometimes it does go into the
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
development side of it uh really we have
 
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
two different things going on um so can
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
a landowner go in and cut six trees uh
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
without filing an intent to cut they can
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned the exemption of
 
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 board fees and 20 cord as well as
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
an exemption to be able to cut trees
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
that are within Striking Distance of
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
your house and that's for the protection
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
of people's personal property that if
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
trees are mature and they may fall down
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
PE land owners can go in and cut those
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
trees so that or have those trees cut so
 
02:39:07.269 --> 02:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
they don't fall on their house follow up
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair follow so with that answer so
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
you recognize that this bill is really
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
address ing people who are exempt from
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
the laws and regulations which fall
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
under your per purview am I correct in
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
that I think after listening to
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
testimony the intent of the bill is is
 
02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
for that however with the bill being
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
under 227 j6 and addressing the intent
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
to cut laws it's adding another level
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
for any timber Harvest within the state
 
02:39:46.349 --> 02:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire okay just one more
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
so if it was in another area of Statute
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
there you you wouldn't have as much
 
02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
concern

02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
I I guess uh I I don't know where it
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
would end up um I mean if it was placed
 
02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and was specific more to
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
development um I I think that might be
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
something uh that could could be looked
 
02:40:16.030 --> 02:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
at uh I we would as an agency to see
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
what that looks like um but being under
 
02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
the forestry laws as it's written it
 
02:40:23.550 --> 02:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
would pertain to every Timber harvest in
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
the state and um I it doesn't sound like
 
02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
that would be the intent okay thank
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
Kelly representative rung touched on my
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
question so I'm not sure how much
 
02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's left to ask but I guess the I'm
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you you sounds like
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
you heard the previous speaker's
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and and you recognize that
 
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
there's seems to be a little bit of a a
 
02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
loophole or some type of issue where the
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
on these smaller Cuts where we're less
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
than the pa7 you know requirements that
 
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
the somebody's signing off saying that
 
02:40:58.590 --> 02:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
they understand that they you have to
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
follow best management practices and and
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
all the other laws that we've laid out
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
so it does seem like there like I don't
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
know if you have any recommendations on
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know on these smaller cutting
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
practices like you know these uh these
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
smaller you know if there's anything you
 
02:41:16.349 --> 02:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
would recommend just that' be my only
 
02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
question I I think as an agency we may
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
come up with recommendations but I'm not
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
any any other
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bale thank you
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to um so this
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
being under a certain section in the law
 
02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
is there another place that where we
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
would be able to do
 
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
this where we can address the um problem
 
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve which is an
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner getting um a tree
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
service to come and then cutting in the
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
Wetland buffer zone leaving the
 
02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.429 align:start position:0%
Wetland buffer zone leaving the
homeowner

02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
to remediate and all of the costs that
 
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
are associated with
 
02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
that I think consultation with uh the
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services may
 
02:42:14.670 --> 02:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
be worthwhile um I know they have their
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
Shand protection laws so they they do
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
more of the Wetland um they they have
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction more over development in
 
02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
Wetlands than than we do Under the
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
forestry end uh so possibly under uh one
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
of de's laws and I'm not familiar with
 
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
all the laws that uh give towns
 
02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
authorization for ordinances or
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions there may be
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere there as well um but I think
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
we need to be careful on on making the
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between homeowner
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
development and Timber
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
harvesting uh as as a whole throughout
 
02:42:57.389 --> 02:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
the state I think there's a a
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.750 --> 02:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
made representative Kelly for a second
 
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you thank you chairman I
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
thought of a better question so um I'm
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
not sure how familiar you are with 227
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
j9 um the penalties and and cutting on
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
near Waterway So speaking specifically
 
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
like just so that we all have an idea
 
02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically about the case
 
02:43:24.429 --> 02:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
that was described with the 22 trees in
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
nsha um under you know the the rules do
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
say that they can't cut more than 50%
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
basal area with you know within 150 ft
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
of a wetland so my question is and it
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
says that the town if they if they
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
notify your department first can pursue
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor penalty um um and my so my
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
question is you know in that case you
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
know what what responsibility does your
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
department have to to to check you know
 
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
that they're you know that they're
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that 50% basal area requirement
 
02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know with if it's just a single lot
 
02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of Frontage on a a
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
stream multi-park question um so 227 j9
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh is the basil area law which does
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
restrict the um amount of wood that can
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
be cut with in uh the area close to
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
water B so it pertains to lakes rivers
 
02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
streams um you you can in fact cut
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
inside of a wetland um during certain
 
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
times of the year and taking the minimum
 
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
impact notification and adhering to the
 
02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
best management for Forest practices um
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
so as far as
 
02:44:44.349 --> 02:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
um this situation where so we we get
 
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
notified as an agency anytime an intent
 
02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
to cut is filed as well as we get copies
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
of the uh minimum impact notifications
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
or they call them SPN now statutory
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
permit by notification uh through Dees
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
so we get copies of those um we have 10
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
forest rangers currently covering the
 
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
state and they go out and inspect the
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
timber Harvest and if they see an issue
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
where somebody has exceeded the 50%
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
basil area then they talk to the land
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
owner in some cases they There are rules
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
that allow them to exceed that they have
 
02:45:27.389 --> 02:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
uh 180 days to convert the land so they
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
they could convert the area that they
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
cut and make it into yard or field uh
 
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
because again that's the buffer between
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
a water body or lake and stream
 
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
um however when you get into larger
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
water bodies you run into Shoreland
 
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
protection ction with Department of
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and they have to
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
comply with those regulations as well um
 
02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
so in this case with 10 12 trees that
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't meet the exemption or or meet the
 
02:46:00.670 --> 02:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
exemption for an intent to cut to be
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
filed we as an agency wouldn't know that
 
02:46:05.950 --> 02:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
was happening uh because we wouldn't
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
receive the intent to cut if we received
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
a complaint we would go and look um and
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
if it falls under a town ordinance then
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
we would that that would be up for the
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
town to enforce but we would have to
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
take the time to go out and inspect it
 
02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
that anyone else seeing no one thank you
 
02:46:34.269 --> 02:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.510 --> 02:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
time Jason
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:48:14.590 align:start position:0%
 
Association

02:48:14.590 --> 02:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:22.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
Flor is yours good good morning and and
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your
 
02:48:29.309 --> 02:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
Indulgence I think I'm the last speaker
 
02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
before lunch so this is always a
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous and perilous area to be but
 
02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief um for the record
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm Jason stock executive director of
 
02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
Association and um I've come here to
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
provide you some information and we are
 
02:48:48.990 --> 02:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to this bill and
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
I wanted to kind of point out a couple
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
things you've already touched on this
 
02:48:56.990 --> 02:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
this affects more than just a homeowner
 
02:48:59.070 --> 02:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
cutting a few trees in their
 
02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
backyard as as drafted it's any person
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
or entity Timber harvesting so this
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
includes commercial Timber harvesting
 
02:49:10.590 --> 02:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
and and that's why I'm here today is
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
this this affects affects our our
 
02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:15.790 align:start position:0%
this this affects affects our our
constituency

02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
constituency
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
um we represent land owners we represent
 
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
loggers Foresters and and wood using
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
entities our members own own and or
 
02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
manage over a million Acres across the
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
state and that many of that acerage has
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
waterfront property has I would dare say
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
most of it has Wetlands we live in a
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
very humid climate and there's Wetlands
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
everywhere um and as a result the state
 
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has has laws governing
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
this and in the harvesting of trees and
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
in fact the state of New Hampshire has
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
several layers of laws regarding this
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
you heard from uh Mr Sherman earlier who
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
was the division of forest and lands
 
02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
he's he is law enforcement for the
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
forestry laws but his laws also include
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
wetlands and then we of course have the
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
they also have enforcement Authority
 
02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
they can enforce they can enforce
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
Wetlands law
 
02:50:20.670 --> 02:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
laws um the the a couple things and and
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
I think one of the elements of this bill
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of concerns us is you're
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
mixing some apples and oranges here just
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the mere fact that the situation that
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
prompted this bill was a homeowner
 
02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
cutting some
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
trees on their property that were in a
 
02:50:42.990 --> 02:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
wetland or adjacent to a piece of water
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
um it you know and they they cut these
 
02:50:48.269 --> 02:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
trees they had a it appears they had a
 
02:50:52.870 --> 02:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
contract they had signed a contract and
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
like it or not there was language in
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
that contract um that said You landowner
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
are responsible for this landowner come
 
02:51:04.750 --> 02:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
to find out land owners the trees
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
weren't supposed to be cut um I it it
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
sounds like they were in a buffer area
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
of some type and landowner is not happy
 
02:51:16.269 --> 02:51:16.279 align:start position:0%
about that and said
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't like the you know I didn't see
 
02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
the fine
 
02:51:22.269 --> 02:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
print they should we should we should
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
address this and and require a a
 
02:51:28.030 --> 02:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
notification process you know let's
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
codify that in law well we have I heard
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
three per 10 years instances of this
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are over 2,000 Timber sales a year
 
02:51:42.269 --> 02:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that occur
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
these requirements would affect in
 
02:51:46.990 --> 02:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
essence almost every one of those unless
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're on a very unique site that's
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
really high and dry and you know there's
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
no there are no Wetlands so as drafted
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a piece that that that
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
concerns us um those commercial Timber
 
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
sales come in all shapes and sizes um
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are instances where a landowner
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
calls a logger directly and says hey
 
02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
Chopper Bob I'd like you to cut some
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
trees down I've got some sick sick trees
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
on the back 40 let's cut those down
 
02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
Chopper Bob and the
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
landowner um figure you know they they
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
fil the intent to cut they do the they
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
do what's needed to be done um to get
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
their permits and Chopper bob cuts it
 
02:52:33.150 --> 02:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
there are also instances where a
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
landowner may have a a
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
Forester Forester will take part of take
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
care of some of that administrative work
 
02:52:42.910 --> 02:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
as well they will kind of they're an
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
agent of that land owner they'll do the
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork there are Foresters that will
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
say look I'll give you the prescription
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'll tell Chopper Bob which trees to cut
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
but you landowner it's on you to do the
 
02:52:57.150 --> 02:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
permitting or it's on Chopper Bob to do
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
the permitting but I'll I'll give you
 
02:53:00.510 --> 02:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
the prescription and I'll tell you how
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
to you know what you want to achieve
 
02:53:05.070 --> 02:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
with this property I'll I'll do that
 
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
then there's also what's called cut and
 
02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:07.630 align:start position:0%
then there's also what's called cut and
yard

02:53:07.630 --> 02:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
yard
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
operations land owner and a
 
02:53:13.469 --> 02:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
Forester um decide to have a Timber sale
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
they call Chopper up and they say
 
02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
Chopper bob cut all the trees out there
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
with a slash of blue paint on it bring
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
them to the log landing and we'll Market
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to market the wood you just
 
02:53:27.150 --> 02:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
load the trucks as they show up so as
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
drafted here it's the person that cuts
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
the trees it's it presumes that that
 
02:53:35.309 --> 02:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
person is kind of the the the the entity
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's doing this and that's not always
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
the case and so that's that's also
 
02:53:42.269 --> 02:53:42.279 align:start position:0%
another problem is that you've got a a
 
02:53:44.910 --> 02:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill that presumes one that these
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
business Arrangements happen kind of in
 
02:53:50.190 --> 02:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
a static set process and that's not the
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
case there's they come in all shapes and
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
sizes on our little piece of property in
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
Tilton um I've had Foresters I've I have
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
a Consulting Forester that came in and I
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
just said I want you to set up the
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
prescription you mark the trees and in
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
this case I went to directly to the mill
 
02:54:12.190 --> 02:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
I called The Sawmill up and I said will
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
you come in and and have the trees cut
 
02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
they called Chopper Bob in this case
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
Adam mock out of Webster they called
 
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
addan and Addie addan is Sun cut the
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
trees sent him to the mill again these
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
come in all shapes and sizes Addie did
 
02:54:31.389 --> 02:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
not do the permitting the Forester did
 
02:54:33.070 --> 02:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
Sawmill didn't do the pering the
 
02:54:36.150 --> 02:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
Forester did so again this bill presumes
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
that these are very linear um deals and
 
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case um the other
 
02:54:45.150 --> 02:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
piece is that
 
02:54:50.590 --> 02:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
um these as as we read it and and and Mr
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
Sherman testified to this there's a
 
02:54:55.389 --> 02:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
question about Municipal ordinances and
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
how Municipal ordinances come into
 
02:55:02.670 --> 02:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
effect if you look at the the RSA 674
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
colon 1 the very last
 
02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:07.950 align:start position:0%
colon 1 the very last
paragraph

02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:55:11.309 --> 02:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
um and and really it's the last sentence
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
of that last paragraph such these are
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
the duties of the planning board such
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
Powers should not include regulating
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting operations that are
 
02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
not part of a subdivision application or
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
a development subject to site plan
 
02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
review so what this says and this has
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
actually been
 
02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
challenged and um affirmed in in
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Superior Court what it
 
02:55:37.150 --> 02:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
says is if it's a commercial Timber sale
 
02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's a if it's Timber
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
harvesting um not even commercial it
 
02:55:43.469 --> 02:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
just says Timber harvesting um unless
 
02:55:46.229 --> 02:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's site plan plan review or if it's a
 
02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
project that was a
 
02:55:50.910 --> 02:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision that that purview falls with
 
02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
Dees they regulate that um and so again
 
02:55:58.590 --> 02:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
when we read this there's a presumption
 
02:56:00.429 --> 02:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
that all wood that's being cut that
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of Municipal ordinance
 
02:56:05.349 --> 02:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
that may apply that is that is in fact
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
not the case um particularly on
 
02:56:10.510 --> 02:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
Commercial Timber sales with respect to
 
02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
the to to the um issue of you know well
 
02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
what about those projects where uh an
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
intent to cut isn't filed so there are
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions if I go out back I I heat
 
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
with wood I hope many of you do as well
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
but if I go out back and cut a dozen
 
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
trees split it put it up and let it dry
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
out that's a and it's less than I
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe it's 20 qu 10 got get this right
 
02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
20 cords thank you it's less than 20
 
02:56:44.110 --> 02:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
cords I don't have to get a per I don't
 
02:56:46.670 --> 02:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to file an intent to cut now
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
if I go out back and and there's a a
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
wetland area or there's an area out back
 
02:56:57.150 --> 02:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
you know no intent to cut is filed uh Mr
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
Sherman he's not going to know he's not
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
going to police everyone in the state
 
02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's cutting wood for their wood stove
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
so again to to to basically tell the
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
division of force and lands now if
 
02:57:12.229 --> 02:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's any trees getting cut even on
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
these some of these personal
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions you now are going to be
 
02:57:19.630 --> 02:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for for ensuring that
 
02:57:21.469 --> 02:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
there's this paper chain of permit
 
02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
notification process or
 
02:57:26.670 --> 02:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
verification um I think is is part of
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
the re part of the some of the concern
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
that you're hearing in terms of
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
resources for the
 
02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:36.870 align:start position:0%
resources for the
state

02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
um me just so there is a the the other
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
piece is education um we heard about
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
homeowners new homeowners not getting
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
educated nhtoa we run education programs
 
02:57:54.269 --> 02:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
for loggers commercial loggers we have a
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary certification program
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
to get to get certified as a logger you
 
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
take four core classes one of which is
 
02:58:05.309 --> 02:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting law we also have these
 
02:58:07.389 --> 02:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
classes for municipal officials you will
 
02:58:09.309 --> 02:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
be surprised that there are municipal
 
02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
officials that not all of them and I get
 
02:58:14.190 --> 02:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
it we're all volunteers I volunteer at
 
02:58:16.030 --> 02:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
the local level not all of them know the
 
02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
laws and so we'll have them for the for
 
02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
the for municipal officials well as well
 
02:58:25.950 --> 02:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
and provide information on Wetlands
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
basil area um all these regulations that
 
02:58:31.870 --> 02:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
you we we've kind of touched on today so
 
02:58:34.269 --> 02:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
there is a there is an education piece I
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
would I would put forth the idea that
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps in in some of these
 
02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities maybe at the town office
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
or or you know or at the transfer
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
station which is always a hot spot for
 
02:58:49.469 --> 02:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
discussion and information sharing is
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
you have some information there for
 
02:58:55.070 --> 02:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners no you know there is
 
02:58:58.830 --> 02:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
no rigid uh information conduit for
 
02:59:00.190 --> 02:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners saying if you're going to be
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
cutting trees um for whatever reason you
 
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
know the in this case the city of nashwa
 
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
there are there are ordinances there are
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
setbacks please please call the concom
 
02:59:12.710 --> 02:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
they'll be happy to happy to come out
 
02:59:15.309 --> 02:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
and talk to you and consult with him but
 
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
again when I talk to the tree tree
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
services they'll say look we don't know
 
02:59:26.389 --> 02:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
we we we don't we operate in so many
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
communities that you know for us to know
 
02:59:32.309 --> 02:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
all the nuances of the local ordinances
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
in every Community we operate they said
 
02:59:38.229 --> 02:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
moreover some of these subdivisions have
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
covenants on them or they'll have
 
02:59:43.630 --> 02:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
conditions when the plan was reviewed or
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
the site plan was approved and they said
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
so for us to go in and go in and start
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
you know we just want to cut some trees
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and make sure that person is happy with
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
their tree service for us to start
 
02:59:58.030 --> 02:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
digging into some of these covenants and
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of these conditions on this the
 
03:00:03.229 --> 03:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
original site plan to understand what
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
can and can't be
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
cut you know sure we can do it we can
 
03:00:10.229 --> 03:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
hire and have an OnStaff attorney and
 
03:00:12.110 --> 03:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
permitting expert but I don't think our
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
clients would be happy with our new tree
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
service fees so again that's why you'll
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
frequently see look if you want us to
 
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
cut trees if they're near your swimming
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
pool your house or on the edge of your
 
03:00:28.990 --> 03:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
backyard you folks you figure it out
 
03:00:30.670 --> 03:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
call your homeowners
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
association call you know call the town
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
call The Code Enforcement that's on you
 
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
know you're better suited to do that
 
03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
than to have us come in and do that um
 
03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
and then you know
 
03:00:48.190 --> 03:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
lastly you know this was a this was a
 
03:00:51.229 --> 03:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
contract issue and so you know we kind
 
03:00:53.790 --> 03:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
of bring it back to the the core here
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
this was a contract issue you had a
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
contract that was signed um between a a
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
a service provider and a
 
03:01:06.429 --> 03:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
homeowner and the homeowner wasn't happy
 
03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and so again to try and legislate a
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
fix for such a contract I mean we could
 
03:01:16.469 --> 03:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
go down the list um I know there are
 
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
folks on this committee that are in the
 
03:01:20.790 --> 03:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
building business or do building you
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
know to so to legislate if if there's an
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
unhappy client there that says gez I
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
wish their quote included
 
03:01:31.550 --> 03:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
mentioning cost overruns well let's pass
 
03:01:33.389 --> 03:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
a bill that all quotes now need to
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
include a provision on cost overruns you
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
could start to see where you're heading
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
down this down this Rabbit Hole so again
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative Duty's
 
03:01:47.309 --> 03:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
efforts here I think I think a more
 
03:01:49.710 --> 03:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
effective way and I've I did talk with
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
her before we F this was filed and but I
 
03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
I think a more effective way to address
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is one of education and not
 
03:02:00.190 --> 03:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
regulation or legislation in this case
 
03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's the homeowner
 
03:02:05.229 --> 03:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
they're they're the members of the
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
homeowners association they're the
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
members that they are the folks that are
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
best equipped to go to the code
 
03:02:12.910 --> 03:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer go to their
 
03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:14.469 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer go to their
Association

03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:02:17.550 --> 03:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
Etc and get the in you know get what are
 
03:02:20.269 --> 03:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
the restrictions here for my
 
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
backyard um with that I'll I'll I'll
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'm happy to try
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions and uh thank
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
you for your Indulgence this
 
03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
morning thank you is there any questions
 
03:02:37.070 --> 03:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
by members of the committee
 
03:02:40.590 --> 03:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly and representative
 
03:02:44.830 --> 03:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
run thank you Mr chair um so my question
 
03:02:47.309 --> 03:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
so I know I know I think I know what
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
half your answer is going to be but all
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
right the so the the you know the pa7
 
03:02:56.870 --> 03:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
the intent to cut has a line where it
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
requires the Forester the person
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
conducting the cut to to sign off and
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
say I understand the rules I understand
 
03:03:05.630 --> 03:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
the law so my question is you know what
 
03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
would be the Fallout from just requiring
 
03:03:11.150 --> 03:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
an intent to cut from anybody condu
 
03:03:13.110 --> 03:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
conducting a cut on anyone else's
 
03:03:16.429 --> 03:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
property so land owner would be would be
 
03:03:20.190 --> 03:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
um Exempted but but then just require
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
saying that section 8 where you actually
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
break down what you're doing does isn't
 
03:03:25.870 --> 03:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
required until you hit that 10,000 board
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
foot yeah great question so I have I
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
have a neighbor um an elderly neighbor
 
03:03:36.229 --> 03:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
they have they have a wood stove they
 
03:03:38.790 --> 03:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
call me up and say Jason you have some
 
03:03:40.750 --> 03:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
strapping young Sons why don't you come
 
03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
over and cut some firewood and I'll pay
 
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
them 10 bucks and buy some pizza for him
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and why don't you cut
 
03:03:49.950 --> 03:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
some firewood on our property for my
 
03:03:54.030 --> 03:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
wood stove um and so to require an
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
intent to cut for my young Sons to go
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
out and cut my neighbors's firewood for
 
03:04:03.070 --> 03:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
their personal consum consumption um I
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
think would be and again not only I
 
03:04:08.429 --> 03:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
think you'll have towns pulling their
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
hair out over these minor intent to Cuts
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
being filed um you're going to have that
 
03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
um we're already hearing from towns on
 
03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
some of these exemptions saying
 
03:04:22.750 --> 03:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
look um we're doing we're we're we're
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
spending quarters to get nickels you
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
know we're spending a lot of time
 
03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
administratively to
 
03:04:31.950 --> 03:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
pursue not a lot of tax dollars to do
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
that where there's no tax dollars I
 
03:04:36.030 --> 03:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
think you're going to have Town clerks
 
03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh we'll give them your personal phone
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
number and say this was aon's idea but I
 
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
think that's going to I think you're
 
03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
going to get pushed back there and and
 
03:04:49.030 --> 03:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I just don't see it as a a
 
03:04:53.150 --> 03:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
workaround thank you representative R
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
stock for taking my question first of
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
all I love Bob the chopper I think we
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
need t-shirts oh Chopper Bob chopper Bob
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
chopper Bob I kept thinking Bob the
 
03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
Builder but um I want to understand a
 
03:05:08.830 --> 03:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more about um the the the the
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
Choppers so um people or firms that
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
would go in do a Timber cut okay they're
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
they're in one level it do they are are
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
any of them the same people who a
 
03:05:24.190 --> 03:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
homeowner would would call up to say gez
 
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
I need to have eight or 10 trees cut
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
along you know my backyard or are those
 
03:05:31.630 --> 03:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
two really separate um
 
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
providers no great question there's a
 
03:05:37.150 --> 03:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
lot of crossover there um there there's
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of crossover um between between
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
kind of I'll call commercial Timber
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
Harvesters the big skitters the big
 
03:05:48.910 --> 03:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
equipment but many times they'll also
 
03:05:51.790 --> 03:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
get a call from a homeowner saying hey
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
we need we need some some trees removed
 
03:05:56.469 --> 03:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
from you know some Hazard trees removed
 
03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
from around the power lines or from
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
around our
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
house um can you do this as well and so
 
03:06:05.790 --> 03:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
they they will do that and sometimes
 
03:06:09.070 --> 03:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
they'll have folks usually they're young
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
young men and young women on their crew
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
that will climb and and do the topping
 
03:06:16.349 --> 03:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
and and kind of cutting the trees down
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of crossover there and
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll even have a Forester
 
03:06:25.309 --> 03:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
on staff so again e just like these
 
03:06:27.070 --> 03:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
Timber sales come in all shapes and
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
sizes these logging companies can as
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
well um they'll have some of them will
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
climb and do that limbing and kind of
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
what you think of as arborist work
 
03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
others will remove Hazard trees and then
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
there are some that I don't want to
 
03:06:43.229 --> 03:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
touch that I just want to work in the
 
03:06:45.309 --> 03:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
Woods leave me alone and I want to do my
 
03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
commercial Timber cutting okay follow
 
03:06:51.269 --> 03:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
up okay so those companies that you just
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
described that have the the the skitters
 
03:06:55.710 --> 03:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
that whole thing they're going to be
 
03:06:58.469 --> 03:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
aware of what the laws are around
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
cutting Timber around Woodland I would
 
03:07:01.870 --> 03:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
expect especially if there's if they've
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
gone through your certification process
 
03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
but are there also other players in this
 
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the tree cutting business who are
 
03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:09.950 align:start position:0%
in the tree cutting business who are
really

03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
small um you know maybe the truck with
 
03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:14.429 align:start position:0%
small um you know maybe the truck with
the

03:07:14.429 --> 03:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
um um chainsaw they would you expect
 
03:07:21.670 --> 03:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they would be familiar with the
 
03:07:25.110 --> 03:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
wetlands laws some are and some aren't
 
03:07:27.070 --> 03:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's like it's like hiring
 
03:07:30.910 --> 03:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
a roofer it's like hiring a mechanic you
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
know you can you can take your car to
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
groni and have a big operation or you
 
03:07:37.830 --> 03:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
can take it to the the person down the
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
street who has a one Bay garage um they
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
can both be they they both can be just
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
as knowledgeable and up to dat on in
 
03:07:48.830 --> 03:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
that case automotive repair same with
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting um in fact there are I
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
can think of off the top of my head
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
several young men that graduated from
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
UNH they um they're in this case a
 
03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
couple of them are Foresters but they
 
03:08:06.229 --> 03:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
also cut wood and they have a chainsaw
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
but they're you know very very sharp
 
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable of the laws the rules
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
and and one of them even climbs and does
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
arborist work on the side as well so
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's again it's you can't really just
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm a single single chainsaw
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
person with a pickup truck that doesn't
 
03:08:29.229 --> 03:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean they're not they're um
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
ignorant of the laws or the rules okay
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:40.990 --> 03:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions you're making up for p lost
 
03:08:45.469 --> 03:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
time thank you we'll get you to lunch
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
shortly thank you Mr chair
 
03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how familiar you are
 
03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how familiar you are
with

03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:08:54.269 --> 03:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
2279 um a lot of the the language in
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
there says no person no person no person
 
03:08:58.950 --> 03:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
so my question is in that that case
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
who's at liability for for a violation
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
of 2279 is it the home is it always the
 
03:09:07.150 --> 03:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
landowner or is it the person doing the
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
cut that's that's 229 is the basil area
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
law yeah yeah I mean you have six here
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting yeah I that that's a good
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
Steve Sherman question I I I think the
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
as with many environmental laws
 
03:09:29.349 --> 03:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
03:09:32.670 --> 03:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
a kind of a culpable they call it a
 
03:09:36.510 --> 03:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
culpable state where if I'm knowingly
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
going out in breaking the law versus
 
03:09:42.190 --> 03:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
accidentally there's that's a
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
distinction but also there is at the end
 
03:09:47.790 --> 03:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
of the day the
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
landowner the landowner it tends to be
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
the the ultimate person but in the case
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
of Basil area I know of instances where
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the landowner it was a Timber
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
Harvester um and they you know they were
 
03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
the individual that okay you violated
 
03:10:09.710 --> 03:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
the law you exceeded the basil area and
 
03:10:11.429 --> 03:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
I think what's important to remember is
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
229 is not the short land protection act
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
so again another apple and orange
 
03:10:19.150 --> 03:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
here when we talk about Shoreland
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
protection you all know because that's
 
03:10:23.469 --> 03:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
an area of the law you you that falls
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
into this committee it's a very
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
different animal than basil area Timber
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
harvesting you know a Timber harvesting
 
03:10:34.349 --> 03:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
operation where the nent to Cuts file
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
does not you know that falls under basil
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
area um Shoreland is you know count the
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
trees and shrubs and it's a different
 
03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
world I don't know Steve how' I
 
03:10:51.370 --> 03:10:51.380 align:start position:0%
do not bad I'll take that is
 
03:10:51.380 --> 03:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
do not bad I'll take that is

03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
good any other questions seeing
 
03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your time and that's
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
o'clock

03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.760 --> 03:59:29.189 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the clock being reset we
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
know it's accurate thank you
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for that um it's uh
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
11:00 and
 
03:59:41.670 --> 03:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
at 1:00 and we're going to be having the
 
03:59:44.110 --> 03:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
1209 and I'll call to the to testify
 
03:59:53.550 --> 03:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you m thank you Mr
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
chair um this is in my opinion pretty
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
simple bill so what it would do is it
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
would allow people to tow people with a
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
boat or a jet ski um and not require a
 
04:00:10.750 --> 04:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
Observer as long as the boat or jet ski
 
04:00:12.790 --> 04:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
has Mirrors um sufficient to see the
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
person who's being towed um so this
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be if someone wanted to still
 
04:00:21.870 --> 04:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
have Observer they could um but this
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't require one so long as the
 
04:00:26.349 --> 04:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
driver of the boat where jet ski can
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually see the person who's being
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
towed and I think this is in line with
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
what um various other states do um not
 
04:00:36.429 --> 04:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
requiring an observer so long as there's
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
um mirrors that allows the operator to
 
04:00:42.990 --> 04:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
see the passenger being towed um and so
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
in cases of a jet ski a lot of jet skis
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
can only carry one person um some of
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
them can carry more but the ones who can
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
carry only one person they're
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
effectively unable then to use it to tow
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
people um which I think is somewhat
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
unfair um so in regards to a safety
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
issue I think it is still safe so long
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
as that person can see someone properly
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
in with mirrors um so the statute um I'm
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
amending headlink about a wide angled
 
04:01:12.149 --> 04:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
mirror um I just replace that to be with
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
the mirror allowing the person to be
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
viewed um if the committee feels
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
separate language or different language
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to better address my
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
intent certainly I would support that um
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
but the intent of this is to not require
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
a third person so long as the um
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
operator can actually see the person
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
being tow in with mirrors and I'm happy
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative Veil
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking this as an
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
observer shall not be required if the mo
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
motorboat is and a bunch of text here is
 
04:01:52.000 --> 04:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
motorboat is and a bunch of text here is
taken

04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
taken
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
out um starting on line five where the
 
04:01:58.229 --> 04:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
motorboat shall be equipped with a wide
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
angle mirror um why is that being
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
removed if we want people to use a
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
mirror to observe the person that
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're Towing so under the present law
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
which um is just for water skiers only
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need an observe uh you don't
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
need an observer as long as um the
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
operator's 18 I don't really take issue
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
with that um the boat does have a wide
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
angle mirror but the really the limiting
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
section is and um on sentus six operated
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
within a slum course approved by the
 
04:02:30.910 --> 04:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
American water ski Association I mean
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
that essentially just makes it so that
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
everyone needs an observer in the state
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
um so this would get rid of that
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
requirement so long as there is is a
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
mirror um and if um you want to keep the
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
language that the operator B18 I
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take an issue with that as
 
04:02:48.670 --> 04:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you for taking my
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
question did sorry did I answer your
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
question or you did thank you okay thank
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
representative Hines for taking my
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
question um you stated um that uh ski
 
04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
craft which are essentially those onep
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
person Jet Skis
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um aren't uh you know it makes it
 
04:03:14.670 --> 04:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to to tow somebody are there
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
other cases or is that the case that
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
you're primarily concerned with here I
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
have a jet ski so personally that's what
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
I care about but um for boers I think
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing that other states
 
04:03:27.149 --> 04:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
just don't distinguish that and do allow
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
boats to do it as well um so while the
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
boat might not be the limiting factor um
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of people required could be a
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
limiting factor so if it's just two
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
people that want to go out one's the
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
operator on to Tower they wouldn't be
 
04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
able to do that under present law um but
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to do that as long
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
as the boat has Mirrors that can
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
adequately see the person being towed um
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
if the person who's being towed isn't
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
okay with that certainly they should not
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
they can either just not do it or get
 
04:03:57.750 --> 04:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
someone else to wait till there is an
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
observer but um hope that answers your
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
question follow follow up thank you Mr
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I follow um
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
so um for the for the ski Craft um
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
because of course there are the the the
 
04:04:14.149 --> 04:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
more common at least on a lot of lakes
 
04:04:15.630 --> 04:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
these days are the three person ski
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
craft or jet skis that um and you you
 
04:04:20.429 --> 04:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
often see people you know getting towed
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
on those but for the one person um if
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
somebody were to like get hurt which has
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
happened to my kids um how if there's
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
only one per one person Jet Ski how do
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.110 --> 04:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
shore like they fall off the they fall
 
04:04:40.590 --> 04:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
off they have a bad you know a bad flip
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't my J ski kind of holds
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
two people so I don't know if the single
 
04:04:49.389 --> 04:04:49.399 align:start position:0%
use ones you're talking about there is
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
no way to do that so um I guess the the
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
issue wouldn't be any different than if
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
it only holds two people and now your
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
Observer is that second person you're
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
still going to have the same issue I
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
guess you can leave an observer behind
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the water and somehow manage to get
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
the injured um person out but um I think
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a limiting thing with
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
really any jet ski potentially thank
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Ron thank you Mr
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
question so with your bill it's just
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
saying it's equipped with a mirror it
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any size so would somebody
 
04:05:29.149 --> 04:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
um just be a up like a really small
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
mirror just to get away with it I mean I
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
mean the bill right I mean the statue
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
right now requires a wide angle mirror
 
04:05:41.469 --> 04:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
with a viewing surface of at least 48
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
square in so I'm saying removing that um
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't would that increase the risk
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the operator would miss seeing if
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
the toe the person skiing had
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
fallen yes I know different states have
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
different mirror requirements ours um as
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
you just pointed out is the wide angle
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
one with 48 in um if if that's the
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
language that you feel is better I would
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
certainly support it if that's type of
 
04:06:10.750 --> 04:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
mirror being required um so I would be
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of that type of amendment um
 
04:06:15.149 --> 04:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
I just picked that language because it
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
it was easier I don't I mean at some
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
point yes people should not be using
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
small mirrors that are just way too
 
04:06:23.550 --> 04:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
small that they can't observe the person
 
04:06:23.560 --> 04:06:25.429 align:start position:0%
small that they can't observe the person
being

04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
code okay followup followup because I
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering it seems in current
 
04:06:34.149 --> 04:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
statute by having the larger mirror um
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
where they they specify it's got to be
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
48 square in that the operator would
 
04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of their peripheral
 
04:06:43.950 --> 04:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
vision in the mirror to notice if the
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
person being towed had fallen or is in
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
distress but just saying
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
mirror I mean anybody could be
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
interpreting that it could be just a a
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
small mirror and I'm just wondering
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
without the benefit of the peripheral
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
vision do you expect someone could go
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
without the peripheral vision and be
 
04:07:08.110 --> 04:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
able to know if someone's Fallen so I
 
04:07:09.870 --> 04:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
think one of the issues with the 48
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
square inch mirror is that's kind of big
 
04:07:14.429 --> 04:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
specifically for a jet ski so I I
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
installed aftermarket mirrors on my jet
 
04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
ski they're not 40 in um they are wide
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
angled it does allow me to view the
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
person behind um them behind me um but
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
it I just know it's not 48 in if I had
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
to guess it's it's at least four I think
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's roughly like 4X 4ish and I believe
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
other states that's kind of what they
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
were using so I think 48 square in is
 
04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
kind of big um I perhaps the wide angle
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
part's important but um the reason I
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
just left it as it is is U my language
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
just says it allows the person to be
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
viewed so I mean if the mirror is not
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
doing its job that you can't view the
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
person I would say that's not complying
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
with the statute okay thank
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
you representative wolf thank you um
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
where does this come in and I didn't
 
04:08:02.710 --> 04:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
have a chance to read it through but is
 
04:08:05.070 --> 04:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
this only for Honor slom
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
course so the present law Yes mine gets
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
rid of that no so it allows it
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere the present law allows it uh
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
the present law doesn't require an
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
observer so long as the person's 18 and
 
04:08:23.109 --> 04:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's a appropriate mirror and it's on a
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
Solem course I think really that's the
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
limiting thing of those three things um
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
so my um proposed bill would get rid of
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
all that and just not require it
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere on a public body of water um or
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
private body of water so long as there
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
mirror so follow up followup Mr so
 
04:08:47.640 --> 04:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
mirror so follow up followup Mr so
anybody

04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
can tow a water
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
skier as long as they have a mirror and
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
no second person required in the boat
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
any place on any Lake if this bill
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
passes yes that's the
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
intent and you don't feel that's a
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
safety house
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
I don't because the it's is in line with
 
04:09:12.990 --> 04:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
what various other states do I didn't
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
take an exact I quickly did some
 
04:09:16.349 --> 04:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
research online looks like a lot of them
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
were Southern States um but it is what
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
other states do I don't think it is a
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
safety issue because the at the end of
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the day the operator is responsible for
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
that person um and if they're using the
 
04:09:26.960 --> 04:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
that person um and if they're using the
mirror

04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
mirror
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately um I see an issue so um if
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
the person being tow feels it's a safety
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
issue they just in my opinion shouldn't
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.510 --> 04:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative I have one representative
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
if you'll take it um you made a comment
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
about approved slalom courses by the
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
American water ski
 
04:10:04.030 --> 04:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
Association are there any approved SL s
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
slom SL slom courses in New Hampshire by
 
04:10:11.109 --> 04:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
that group actually don't know because I
 
04:10:13.109 --> 04:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
don't do that um perhaps someone of the
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
commit is more knowledgeable with it I
 
04:10:16.750 --> 04:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
guess I just assumed there was if
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
there's law dealing with that but I
 
04:10:20.349 --> 04:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
actually don't know the answer okay
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that's the next uh next
 
04:10:31.080 --> 04:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
testimony that's the next uh next
Sergeant

04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
Seth Ali yes l IE of the Marine
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
Patrol good afternoon Sergeant good
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair the state of New
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol is opposed to
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill there are uh some concerns
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
that the the state of New Hampshire
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol sees with this uh been
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
with the department for 27 years been on
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
on the water many times the one big
 
04:11:03.109 --> 04:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
concern that that the state sees is that
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
injured party should they fall how is it
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
to be rent rendered assistance to that
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
injured party with one boat operator and
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
an injured person in the water how does
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
that boat then get back to that operator
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
or injured person sorry and then get
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
into the water to then render
 
04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
assistance at that point when you have
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
that Observer on board that we say has
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
to be 13 years or old and capable of
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
rendering assistance therefore that
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
person can get in the water I.E hold a
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
head up maybe stop some bleeding where a
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
tourniquet may be needed where where is
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
how do they then get back into that boat
 
04:11:43.630 --> 04:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
um I could go on and on for many of the
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh boating accidents that I've been to
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
even when there are multiple observers
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
there and I think by taking away having
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
an observer there and having just a
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
mirror U could really impose some
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
significant injuries to the public out
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
there and or just that operator maybe
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
not seeing that person injured by just
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
mirror questions for the sergeant
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative will thank you and thank
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you see
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
any increase or decrease I should say
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
put it the other way in safety when you
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
have one person that has to monitor
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
where the boat is going and that same
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
person having to monitor the skier
 
04:12:29.550 --> 04:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
behind her him or her yes I I would
 
04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
agree um I myself am a water skier I
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
have a older ski booat and often I have
 
04:12:37.469 --> 04:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
a mirror as well and we see it out on
 
04:12:40.349 --> 04:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
the water often folks I myself sometimes
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
get caught up in it looking behind the
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
mirror is there you can stare at it but
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
often we find ourselves looking back
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
just to see peripheral what's out on the
 
04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
other sides maybe not just right in with
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
what's in line with that mirror I think
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
we all see it out on the road I.E some
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
people using their phones and lean over
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
to look at something we often tend to go
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
that direction so now going back to your
 
04:13:05.309 --> 04:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
co question you know hey I look over my
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
shoulder and now I'm not fall following
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
the direction where I was headed to
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
potentially could cause other safety
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
concerns out
 
04:13:16.030 --> 04:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um a uh related
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
question um we've heard in other um
 
04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
under other bills testimony and other
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
bills that there's been increase in the
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
amount of traffic on some of our water
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
bodies I know that you know um on days
 
04:13:37.349 --> 04:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
like Fourth of July or um Labor Day for
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
example they Lakes can get pretty busy
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
um could there be uh in addition to sort
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
of looking over your shoulder is there
 
04:13:47.149 --> 04:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
this notion that you're either focused
 
04:13:50.910 --> 04:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
on person behind you or the traffic
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
around you or missing the person behind
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
you falling off because because you got
 
04:13:57.870 --> 04:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
traffic yes I would agree with you
 
04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
entirely uh I think that as a whole here
 
04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we've seen a large
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
increase of boating Rec ational due to
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
co due to everything that's happening
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
out there right now and on those busy
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
weekends where like you said sir you
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
know trying to watch other boats because
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
we all know there's no yellow white
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
lines out there it's can be a
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
free-for-all and now having to watch a
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
boat coming from my starboard side oh I
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
got to keep eyes on that and oh by the
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
way I need to be looking in the mirror
 
04:14:30.910 --> 04:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
to see if that person falls and then
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
again I really can't stress enough is
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
that rendering assistance I myself had a
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
person wakeboarding fell down said he
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
had back problems my n my passenger on
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
board hopped in real quick to render him
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
assistance whereas I would have had to
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
get out of the boat now get back to the
 
04:14:47.590 --> 04:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
boat to try and get that person up into
 
04:14:47.600 --> 04:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
boat to try and get that person up into
my

04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%

Waters Mr chair yes ma'am um I have um
 
04:15:59.149 --> 04:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
an an amendment to the that Shoreline
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
septic system bill that I introduced a
 
04:16:04.750 --> 04:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago um would you recommend
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
I hand it out now or wait until the
 
04:16:06.439 --> 04:16:08.070 align:start position:0%
I hand it out now or wait until the
executive

04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
session I would recommend both being a
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
conservative person because I think it's
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
good to have it ahead of time but I know
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of the people aren't here and uh
 
04:16:19.710 --> 04:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk will probably want a copy for
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
the record then so I I would do both
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative wrong here so if you want
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:40.109 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:16:40.109 --> 04:16:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.119 --> 04:16:40.990 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
chairman representative wolf um is there
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
any possibility can we go into a can we
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
exec a bill now uh I was asked a
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
question about executing the bill and I
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
have a hesitation to EXA the bill when
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay um you could email
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
him because we're having a ton of bills
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're executing next week at 9:00 a ton
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
of them so if it's a bill you think is
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
short it may already be on that list if
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
not we could ask the chair to add it yes
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
no I I'm wondering if we could do it now
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
because I detect a unanimous decision on
 
04:17:31.149 --> 04:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
this last I think before he left the
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
chair says all the bills we do today
 
04:17:34.590 --> 04:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
will be on exec next
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
week okay so we're not going to do it
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:51.790 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:18:51.790 --> 04:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.640 --> 04:19:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
too

04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.560 --> 04:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:48:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
start

04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:56:46.590 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:56:46.590 --> 04:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
9 relative to the purchase and sale of
 
04:56:51.548 --> 04:56:51.558 align:start position:0%
any interest in Real Property AB budding
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
public Waters I call forth the prime
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
Ron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee um for allowing me this
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce you introduce
 
04:57:07.040 --> 04:57:08.868 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce you introduce
hp1

04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
hp1
 
04:57:14.590 --> 04:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
1229 um this bill came about because
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
anodot I have heard so many stories
 
04:57:23.310 --> 04:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
about um new Property Owners they they
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
purchase property that is subject to the
 
04:57:28.750 --> 04:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection water quality act
 
04:57:30.350 --> 04:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
and they're not aware of that and they
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
go around and what we've heard in
 
04:57:33.548 --> 04:57:33.558 align:start position:0%
previous test when they cut down all
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
these trees they may fertilize their
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
yard they have other behaviors that
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
really harm the lake and the harm that
 
04:57:45.628 --> 04:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
it causes can last Generations you
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
clearcut along a Lakefront it takes a
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
long time to um reverse or at least get
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
back to the steady state of the
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
stability of the of the shorefront um it
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
leads to erosion it leads to um uh run
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
off and we've heard earlier about the
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
hazards that these activities cause to
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
the lake and the Damage it creates
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
especially adding phosphorus to the lake
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
so this this bill is a simple bill that
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
when property that is subject to the
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection act that when it's
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
being transferred from a bu a seller to
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
a buyer that part of that transaction
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
has to include notification that the
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
property is subject to the ACT Dees does
 
04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a document called a minimum
 
04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
standards document which summarizes what
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
are the expectations of a Shoreland
 
04:58:47.470 --> 04:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
owner um and so upon at that closing or
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
that transaction the buyer would be
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
given that document so there's would be
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
no reason for a buyer at a later point
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
to say oh I didn't know I wasn't
 
04:58:58.590 --> 04:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that because they were
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
notified that they have extra
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in purchasing this
 
04:59:06.670 --> 04:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
product property that there a butter is
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
public Waters that are under the the um
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
Guidance the the protection of the
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
state so um I think it's it's pretty
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
clear I do want to bring attention to an
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
amendment that I passed out to you um
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
when I was in discussions with Dees they
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
raised concerns about the amount or just
 
04:59:28.520 --> 04:59:29.430 align:start position:0%
raised concerns about the amount or just
the

04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:32.590 --> 04:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
violation um and it it's in the original
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
bill it starts at line
 
04:59:38.190 --> 04:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
16 it says any violation of this section
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
coupled with any violation of RSA 43b or
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
the Department's rules and regulations
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
should be result in a civil penalty
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%

civil penalty shall not preclude a
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
judgment inequity or law that whole
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
paragraph has been removed so
 
05:00:09.868 --> 05:00:09.878 align:start position:0%
essentially that um the you know at
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
closing if I'm sure many of you have
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
purchased property you're signing
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
notifications that you've received
 
05:00:17.830 --> 05:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
notification of this notification of
 
05:00:19.628 --> 05:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
that they would also receive a
 
05:00:22.110 --> 05:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
notification that this property is
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
subject to the Shoreline protection act
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
and here are some minimum standards for
 
05:00:27.160 --> 05:00:28.708 align:start position:0%
and here are some minimum standards for
um

05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
compliance um I know that the department
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
has raised some ISS issues with um
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
having receipt of that signed or the
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
receipt of that notification going back
 
05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
to them my original conversations that I
 
05:00:43.948 --> 05:00:43.958 align:start position:0%
recall with Ds said they have no problem
 
05:00:45.548 --> 05:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
they receive a lot of these signed
 
05:00:47.708 --> 05:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
notifications but they would just keep
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
them on file because um in the future if
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
that property owner is found to be in
 
05:00:55.708 --> 05:00:55.718 align:start position:0%
violation they can't claim ignorance
 
05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
they can't claim oh I didn't know I
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't supposed to do this because there
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
is that sign notification on file and I
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
do want to bring your attention to uh
 
05:01:09.868 --> 05:01:09.878 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard for HB 1103 that was
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
the bill we heard January 17th that
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
would um clarify the enforcement of the
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection act if you remember
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
presently under statute the department
 
05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
has to show that there has been a
 
05:01:26.670 --> 05:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
violation but also show that there's
 
05:01:29.310 --> 05:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
been direct damage to the lake and that
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
the person um knew that it was a VI
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
violation and that they have to
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrate good faith effort if you
 
05:01:39.750 --> 05:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
remember it was kind of confusing so we
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
just the the the hp103 is just to show
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we can enforce this act if there is
 
05:01:49.150 --> 05:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
a violation period but during that
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um uh Sarah Holland from the
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire realtors association
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
raised the issue of notification and she
 
05:01:59.948 --> 05:01:59.958 align:start position:0%
had said current statute is not working
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
to protect public Waters the notific
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
ation piece is important and this is
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
that notification piece so I think that
 
05:02:11.070 --> 05:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
this will go a long way to educating
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
property owners that when they are
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
buying property that is subject to the
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection act that there is
 
05:02:19.120 --> 05:02:20.110 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection act that there is
added

05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
added
 
05:02:23.310 --> 05:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I would be happy to um
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have any
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative well I have one
 
05:02:32.040 --> 05:02:36.310 align:start position:0%
representative well I have one
representative

05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
we have been discussing the requirements
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
by the real estate board and uh Realtors
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
of notifying people about the um
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection act in the septic
 
05:02:53.708 --> 05:02:53.718 align:start position:0%
system inspections that are required so
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
if there's a penalty for not doing that
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is every buyer
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
is going to get that
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
report why do we need to have enough the
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
law saying they need to be notified of
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
the Shoreland protection act when
 
05:03:10.830 --> 05:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting the inspection of the
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
septic system that tells them it's under
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
the shoreline protection act um well
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair for the
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
question septic systems are just a very
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
small part of what the shoreline
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
protection act is about um what what it
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
is it has to do with where structures
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
can be um there there's certain setbacks
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
that go beyond a local
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
zoning um there's like I mentioned
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
before the cutting of trees removal of
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
vegetation um many there are many other
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
behaviors than um not maintaining a
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
functioning septic system that goes into
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
that Shoreline protection act so just
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
just getting a report on their septic
 
05:03:58.270 --> 05:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
system is not notifying them of all of
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
these other responsibilities that they
 
05:04:00.000 --> 05:04:00.830 align:start position:0%
these other responsibilities that they
would

05:04:00.830 --> 05:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
have thank you any questions
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you and thank
 
05:04:10.430 --> 05:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I think that
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
um I've got a couple of phraseology
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
problems in this document I think it's
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
fine that they have to be notified right
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
now a buyer has to be notified of the
 
05:04:23.948 --> 05:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
possibility of lead paint of radon and
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
all those things and I think the Shand
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
um you have in here that the buyer has
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge and understand the
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
document I have real trouble
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that whole Shoreland
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
protection document so I would suggest
 
05:04:48.788 --> 05:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
that that may be amended in there and
 
05:04:53.910 --> 05:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
um just keep the owners on the seller to
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
deliver notification that they may be
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the Shoreland
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
protection okay
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
noted thank you very much representative
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
wolf and I'll work with you on that
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay thank you representative
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
Donell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
R uh I purchased a couple houses my
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
lifetime and when you're in a closing or
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
when you're in that mine there is so
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
many documents you are just literally
 
05:05:29.470 --> 05:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
signing yes yes yes how do you think
 
05:05:32.190 --> 05:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to stand out and is there
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
any um this may be a question back to
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
Dees or someone else with um how do you
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
elevate this to have them go get either
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
maybe Education certification other than
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
just they may sign this and this would
 
05:05:50.788 --> 05:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
just be another thing they sign and say
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
yep check done but never really read the
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
document that's a great question and
 
05:05:59.350 --> 05:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
I've been in that situation
 
05:05:59.360 --> 05:06:00.910 align:start position:0%
I've been in that situation
myself

05:06:00.910 --> 05:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:06:03.788 --> 05:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
um if I I'm trying to get into the mind
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
of a buyer who's buying waterfront
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
property that's really an exciting
 
05:06:10.750 --> 05:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity a lot of people don't have
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
that and when someone does that they
 
05:06:17.070 --> 05:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
know that they're getting property that
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
is kind of special they're buying it
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
because maybe it's going to be a a
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
second home or um a retirement home
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
where they've saved they've always
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to live on Waterfront so I think
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
during that closing and they see oh
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
Shoreline protection act I think that's
 
05:06:35.868 --> 05:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
going to stand out to someone because
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
they're likely buying that property
 
05:06:40.548 --> 05:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
specifically for the
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
shoreline and this notification would
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
alert them that that comes with added
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that you're not going
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
to have for any other property you know
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
raidon um all those things
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative wolf mentioned
 
05:07:01.708 --> 05:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
and lead lead paint um I was just on a
 
05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
bill about we had it was we were lead
 
05:07:06.750 --> 05:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
arsonic there's a lot of things even if
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
you have a private well that you have to
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
be notified on um and most people would
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
just say oh yeah that's that that's
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
expected but not everybody expects that
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with the shoreline
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
protection act um so I think that it
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
would be something that would stand out
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
more than a
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
typical other notifications but
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
additionally it does Prov provide some
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh protection if 1103 doesn't pass um
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
this gives us a way of showing PE hey
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
you were notified you were aware of your
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities or that you're subject
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the Shoreline protection act because
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
right now someone can com someone could
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
clear cut the the front of their
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
property of trees and DS comes in and
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're investigating it and the person
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
can say I didn't have any idea I wasn't
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that and they can't
 
05:08:04.708 --> 05:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
enforce the statute under that
 
05:08:06.548 --> 05:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
circumstance but if they know that
 
05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
someone says no when you bought this
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
property you were aware that you were
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
notified that you're under the shoreline
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
protection act it it just that by itself
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
establishes awareness of they were they
 
05:08:25.230 --> 05:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
had there was a compliance that they had
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
to agree
 
05:08:28.000 --> 05:08:29.670 align:start position:0%
to agree
with

05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:08:32.910 --> 05:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
follow follow thank you um
 
05:08:35.470 --> 05:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
30 well 20 years ago when I first bought
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
my I my first Lake home I uh I did not
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
have that same mindset now that I've
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
lived on a lake and now that I've been
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
engaged with it more and more absolutely
 
05:08:48.270 --> 05:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
I have that mindset that you're you're
 
05:08:50.510 --> 05:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
talking about um I don't think everyone
 
05:08:52.990 --> 05:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
has the same mindset that is like this
 
05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
is special this is something it is but
 
05:08:57.628 --> 05:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
they may not have the full understanding
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
of that and I I applaud this bill in
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
many many ways because I you know had
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
wish I had the in the more fortitude
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
back than 20 years ago um so I would I
 
05:09:11.708 --> 05:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
would love to be part of your amendment
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
process to see if we can figure out a
 
05:09:16.110 --> 05:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
better way to make sure the education is
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
is something that they may take a class
 
05:09:20.590 --> 05:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
on they may do something outside of this
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
but I think just
 
05:09:24.990 --> 05:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
stating sorry I'm supposed to have a
 
05:09:27.310 --> 05:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to just help with this
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
a little further I would appreciate it
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
and at the minimum it's a star
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative I mean I mean it it's
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
really the
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
basic um start to just get people aware
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
that guess what there is a shoreline
 
05:09:43.350 --> 05:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
protection act and if there's things
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we can do beyond that to give them
 
05:09:50.788 --> 05:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
specific education on just how do you
 
05:09:53.310 --> 05:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
maintain a lawn when you're within that
 
05:09:56.548 --> 05:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
zone uh without using fertilizer and I
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
do believe I'm not exactly sure maybe um
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
Miss Forest can educate us on this but I
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
I think there are tutorials on DS's
 
05:10:08.190 --> 05:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
website on how to be a responsible
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
Lakefront owner and I know New Hampshire
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
lakes does with their Lakes smart
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
program they do a lot of education on
 
05:10:16.948 --> 05:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
that representative Vale thank you Mr
 
05:10:18.750 --> 05:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you representative run
 
05:10:20.910 --> 05:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
for putting forward the bill and for
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I was just looking
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
online at the submissions and I noticed
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
a question that I don't think has been
 
05:10:30.310 --> 05:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
answered yet and so the person who wrote
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
in said I have a con concern that a
 
05:10:35.708 --> 05:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
failure to accurately represent degree
 
05:10:38.590 --> 05:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
of Conformity to the Shoreland
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
protection requirements would lead to
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
liability claims against the seller do
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
you see that as an issue with this
 
05:10:50.910 --> 05:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill I don't um I don't really
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
understand it as well as I should to be
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
able to answer it so what you're saying
 
05:10:57.628 --> 05:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
is that if a buyer realizes that the
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
seller has not complied with the
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection act then
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
they may be liable the buyer may be
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
liable so for instance if the seller
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
cuts down the
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
trees there's a
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
buyer um would they then assume the
 
05:11:16.750 --> 05:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
liability of that
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
violation that that's a good question to
 
05:11:21.390 --> 05:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
ask D yes I would think no because I
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
think the violation is on the offender
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so it would have to be the offender
 
05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
would be the Violator somebody I don't
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
think somebody in that situation assumes
 
05:11:34.750 --> 05:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Li liability from someone else but
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not a good person to answer that
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
question but that's just what I think my
 
05:11:41.948 --> 05:11:41.958 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I think that's a good
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative thank
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
you other questions for the
 
05:11:48.510 --> 05:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative Darby
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
representative R for taking my
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
question um so you like you said you
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
struck out um sub paragraph 4 um you
 
05:11:59.868 --> 05:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
left sub paragraph three which is the
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
reporting of the signed form to Dees is
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
that um intended for the um sort of for
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that awareness if there's later
 
05:12:13.270 --> 05:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement is that the intent yes okay
 
05:12:16.110 --> 05:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:28.510 --> 05:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
lont do you have a copy of that minimum
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
standards document no I don't when I ini
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
initially proposed this LSR to OS um I
 
05:12:38.510 --> 05:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
was actually coming up like that they
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to present a one or two pager that
 
05:12:43.350 --> 05:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
summarizes a landowners responsibility
 
05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
under the shoreline protection act and
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney the OS attorney got back to
 
05:12:49.948 --> 05:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
me and said they already have he he had
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
been in touch with Dees and they he said
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
they already have this minimum standards
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
document so he asked if he could just
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
put that in statute and I said does it
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
serve the function of the document I was
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
proposing he said
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:13:12.390 --> 05:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions I have one more followup if I
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
might um being a real estate
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
transactional attorney I can tell you
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
people a closings don't read hardly
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
anything you give them because they just
 
05:13:23.948 --> 05:13:23.958 align:start position:0%
want to buy the property but you want to
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
notify people I'm wondering why didn't
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
you put this notification under 477 with
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
the Arsenic and the lead paint and all
 
05:13:34.830 --> 05:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
notifications and then say that that
 
05:13:40.030 --> 05:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
should be added to the laundry list and
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
those notifications do have some uh
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
liability concerns and they're mentioned
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
in there about what if you failed to do
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
this I just wondered would this not be
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
more appropriate under 477 than
 
05:13:56.670 --> 05:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
483 well um my intent of keeping this
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
separate is that it's only going to
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
apply to a very small number of
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
properties relative to um the the
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
general notification like the r Snick
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
many of those those only apply to homes
 
05:14:12.190 --> 05:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
with private well Waters private Wells
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
so the the notifications dependent on
 
05:14:20.190 --> 05:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
the type of property I don't I I mean my
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the when there's a
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
real estate transaction the types of
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
notifications that have to be made are
 
05:14:31.150 --> 05:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
dependent on the property and the if
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
there's sewer are a septic so it it
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to everybody so I wanted
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
this notification to only apply to
 
05:14:41.230 --> 05:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
properties that would H that would um be
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
under that
 
05:14:47.070 --> 05:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
act rather than part of a laundry
 
05:14:49.868 --> 05:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
list thank you any other questions for
 
05:14:49.878 --> 05:14:50.590 align:start position:0%
list thank you any other questions for
the

05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative saying none thank you
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
you since amendments were mentioned I'm
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh Darlene for of the D if
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:15.788 --> 05:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
next good afternoon my name is Darlene
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
Forest I'm the current Wetland Bureau
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
administrator Shoreland protection Falls
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
underneath the Wetland Bureau at this
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
time within the Department of
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I'd like to thank
 
05:15:28.948 --> 05:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
the committee for hearing our comments I
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
have already passed out the Department's
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
letter of testimony um to summarize it
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
essentially states that the department
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
is not supportive of a fine for failure
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
to submit the notice because
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
it seems somewhat disproportionate for
 
05:15:45.958 --> 05:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
it seems somewhat disproportionate for
administrative

05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
05:15:51.628 --> 05:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
um administrative process failure when
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
compared to actual environmental
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes failures that we sometimes see
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
in addition the department
 
05:16:02.430 --> 05:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
is not in favor of being The Keeper of
 
05:16:05.230 --> 05:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
the signed document the department does
 
05:16:08.590 --> 05:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
not believe that it is necessary to have
 
05:16:11.470 --> 05:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
a signed document in order to enforce
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
Department very much appreciates the
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill and thanks
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative rung for filing it and
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
advancing education of Shoreline
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
protection issues we wholeheartedly
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
support that aspect of this bill for
 
05:16:27.628 --> 05:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
education and notification of new
 
05:16:33.990 --> 05:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
owners however um on the ISS issue
 
05:16:37.310 --> 05:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
of accepting the signed document there
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
are some things
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we would note that makes that
 
05:16:41.600 --> 05:16:42.868 align:start position:0%
that we would note that makes that
document

05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
itself not of significant value to us in
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
the compliance uh in the compliance
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
realm one laws change if the Law changes
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
the document is only certifying that the
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
person knew what was in the fact
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
sheet not the entirety of the law at the
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
time that they signed or they purchased
 
05:17:03.760 --> 05:17:04.628 align:start position:0%
time that they signed or they purchased
the

05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:07.150 --> 05:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
property so as soon as you've changed
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
something on the fact sheet or in the
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
law you start to degrade the value of
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
that certification
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
document uh we would note that within
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
this language since there's been
 
05:17:20.548 --> 05:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
discussion of an amendment it talks
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
about the minimum standards
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
document which indicates it's a very
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
specific document it may be wise to say
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum standards document to to be
 
05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
prepared by the
 
05:17:36.868 --> 05:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
department and we might want to be
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
specific about what that
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
explains that way if the Law
 
05:17:46.110 --> 05:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
changes we update the fact sheets with
 
05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
the changes to the to the statute or the
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
rules and it
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
becomes there's no question at that
 
05:17:55.948 --> 05:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
point the right document there's no
 
05:17:57.948 --> 05:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
issue with updating the document it
 
05:18:01.150 --> 05:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
allows it to be a more updated exchange
 
05:18:01.160 --> 05:18:02.590 align:start position:0%
allows it to be a more updated exchange
of

05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
information with the certification uh
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
many properties are held by trust many
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
Shoreline properties are held uh by
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
llc's by multiple members of a family
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
does every individual have to sign it um
 
05:18:21.190 --> 05:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
there are frequently times when we deal
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
with trust because people don't want us
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
to know who owns that property um that's
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
one of the weird and unique things about
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that some people like
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
about it is is the fact that there's a
 
05:18:35.230 --> 05:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
certain amount of anonymity sometimes
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
with being here and they will not I can
 
05:18:40.510 --> 05:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee we will not be getting owner
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
signatures on these documents for all
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
Shoreland properties we will be getting
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
trustees or whoever has the power of
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
attorney we don't believe that affects
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
our ability to enforce but it goes to it
 
05:18:55.868 --> 05:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
goes to why the department doesn't
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
believe we need to have that particular
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
document in our
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
possession if a violation has in fact uh
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
occurred absolutely hope the education
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
makes it all the way through to whoever
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
is the owner and who is staying there
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
and asking for work to be
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
done but we don't think that that
 
05:19:16.350 --> 05:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
document is crucial for our ability to
 
05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
do it to proceed with compliance
 
05:19:19.600 --> 05:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
do it to proceed with compliance
actions

05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
actions
 
05:19:23.470 --> 05:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
um I also want to remind everybody
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a common problem that we
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
all say Lakes shorland protection act
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
also applies to title Waters and it
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
applies to many Rivers which are fourth
 
05:19:35.350 --> 05:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
order which might not be as big as we
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes Envision so and for those
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
folks it may just be that you out and
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
buy a property that has a river in your
 
05:19:42.680 --> 05:19:45.190 align:start position:0%
buy a property that has a river in your
backyard

05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
so please keep that in mind it's not
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
always I'm looking for Shoreline because
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
I finally got to be a shoreline it's
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
just so happens I have a river in my
 
05:19:55.760 --> 05:19:57.430 align:start position:0%
just so happens I have a river in my
backyard

05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
so with that said if you folks have any
 
05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
questions be happy to answer
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative wolf thank you
 
05:20:13.868 --> 05:20:13.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:20:17.310 --> 05:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
um yes I agree with you that the
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
document can change over time but at the
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
time of a
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
purchase would this give you a date
 
05:20:30.750 --> 05:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
certain that you could have another tool
 
05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement it won't be
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
detrimental but I suspect the argument
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
that we will hear is this is a fact
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
sheet not the law and I only read the
 
05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
fact sheet I might have missed some
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
aspect of the law
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
so yes it is a
 
05:20:59.670 --> 05:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
tool assuming that you have the right
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
signature on it
 
05:21:02.040 --> 05:21:04.628 align:start position:0%
signature on it
and

05:21:04.628 --> 05:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that comes into play I I know how I've
 
05:21:12.030 --> 05:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
experienced enough of these Enforcement
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
cases that I can sense the argument that
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
will come through and if the fact
 
05:21:19.150 --> 05:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
sheet if signing the fact sheet becomes
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
what you're responsible for that fact
 
05:21:24.670 --> 05:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
sheet be had better be awfully
 
05:21:27.788 --> 05:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
good follow follow
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
up um when I was talking with repres
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
representative run we talked about a
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
notification that the buyer is aware
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
that the property may be subject to the
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
Shoreland protection
 
05:21:45.788 --> 05:21:45.798 align:start position:0%
act without being specific but it puts
 
05:21:48.590 --> 05:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
the buyer on notice would
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that if we modify to that those terms
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
that they may they have purchased a
 
05:21:56.910 --> 05:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
property that may be subject to the
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
shorel protection
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
act um I issue is not the Department's
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
issue is not so much with the exact
 
05:22:06.510 --> 05:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
language of it the Department's issue is
 
05:22:07.948 --> 05:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not the certification has to
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
be filed and kept by the department and
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
no and so it it the language would not
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
be better or worse per se understand
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
that we would not rely on it as critical
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
to making the case
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:22:29.958 --> 05:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
testimony

05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.350 --> 05:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
Realtors good morning Mr morning gez
 
05:22:51.628 --> 05:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
already screwed up good afternoon Mr
 
05:22:53.230 --> 05:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee thank
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
you for uh taking my testimony I do have
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
a a prepared testimony but I thought I'd
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
go a little bit off script based upon
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
some of the Q&amp;A that's come earlier
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and I just say uh overall for the
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is uh Chris Norwood I am
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent in the state of New
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I reside in Portsmouth uh I am
 
05:23:14.430 --> 05:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
the principal of nii Norwood group a
 
05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate brokerage firm
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
with offices in Portsmith and Bedford
 
05:23:20.270 --> 05:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I am the
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
2024 uh public policy chair of the New
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors for
 
05:23:27.948 --> 05:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
which I'm speaking today um so the
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
Realtors are opposed to this bill um I
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate apprciate uh representative
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
Run's um uh amendment that would remove
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
the $1,000 fine I think that we'd have a
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
concern there about the penalty um as I
 
05:23:42.670 --> 05:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
look down the bill and hearing some of
 
05:23:45.708 --> 05:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
the testimony it sounds like there's a a
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of the bill being a tool for
 
05:23:52.270 --> 05:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
education for the people who um would
 
05:23:54.270 --> 05:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise inhabit the property along the
 
05:23:57.070 --> 05:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
shoreline or an enforcement tool for the
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
dees for those who um perhaps take
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
advantage or don't follow the Shoreland
 
05:24:04.670 --> 05:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
protection act um and and as it relates
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
to the education piece um Mr chair I'd
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
like to just quickly discuss uh RSA 477
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
so RSA 477 are notifications that have
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
to take place prior to the transfer of
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
title and I just make a distinction and
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
I know representative wolf you raised
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
this earlier um RSA 4774 a are
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
notifications so that's raon arsenic
 
05:24:30.990 --> 05:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
lead paint and I believe soon to be p
 
05:24:32.910 --> 05:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
which was previously approved by this
 
05:24:36.750 --> 05:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so the the notification
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
piece is that statement that says this
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
exists I think it outlines your question
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this property may contain uh it may
 
05:24:49.948 --> 05:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
be by the shoreline uh as opposed to RSA
 
05:24:54.350 --> 05:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
4774 C and D which include property
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
specific disclosures this property does
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
have this water system it does have this
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
sewer system it perhaps has uh
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
insulation of this type if it's going to
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
be used as a residential dwelling so
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction in my mind between
 
05:25:10.030 --> 05:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
the language of notification and
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure but none of those documents
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
have a separate third-party state
 
05:25:17.788 --> 05:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
sponsored form uh the minimum standards
 
05:25:20.030 --> 05:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
form which must be signed at the time of
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
closing and remitted to the dees and
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's another component that we have a
 
05:25:26.830 --> 05:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
concern about obviously we had the
 
05:25:29.230 --> 05:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
aformentioned concern about the
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
liability to the the seller of the
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
property if they didn't uh have that
 
05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
form properly filled out in the Thousand
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
fine but we do also have a concern
 
05:25:42.510 --> 05:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
relative to having a separate form be
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
signed and it becoming part of that um
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
that that uh pile of paperwork that
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
folks perhaps do not understand uh let
 
05:25:54.750 --> 05:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
me just take a quick note as to some of
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
the other questions that came forth um
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier about um some
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
of the other tools that the uh Shoreland
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
protection act address and uh we
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
certainly are supportive overall of
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
keeping healthy rivers and streams and
 
05:26:16.030 --> 05:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
lakes uh I believe there is a bill hb1
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
1293 which is an Ena presently that uh
 
05:26:21.030 --> 05:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
deals with phosphorus and runoff which
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of um I'll also say
 
05:26:25.628 --> 05:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we had in the
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
bill is this bill also uh addresses this
 
05:26:31.830 --> 05:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
form being signed by leses of property
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
and for that matter it also deals with
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
condominium owners of property and uh
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
neither broadly speaking less ease of
 
05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
property and um condominium owners who
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
may not uh have a a full vote at the
 
05:26:49.868 --> 05:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
board of the condominium don't have a
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
direct um say certainly leses don't over
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
cutting of trees or or what type of um
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know vegetation goes on the property
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
so there's some of this bill in the in
 
05:27:06.310 --> 05:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
the first section that deals with leses
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and obviously condominium owners
 
05:27:10.590 --> 05:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
and I just have a concern there that
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
they really don't have any need to be uh
 
05:27:16.030 --> 05:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
trained in this regard and I'd say
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
finally um from the realtor
 
05:27:23.230 --> 05:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint the the number of properties
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
that are along the shoreline that
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
transact every year um
 
05:27:29.520 --> 05:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
transact every year um
is

05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably I I we can get the better
 
05:27:35.310 --> 05:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
research but I believe what I've read is
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 2 and 4% of all
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
Shoreland properties transact every year
 
05:27:43.548 --> 05:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
and the reason I raised that is perhaps
 
05:27:46.750 --> 05:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's a better tool if to to raise
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
this above the education barrier so it
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't get buried in the paperwork at
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
the at the time of transaction perhaps
 
05:27:56.670 --> 05:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
you could uh have the municipality or
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
Dees directly notify these Property
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
Owners on an ongoing basis um rather
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
than wait for all of the transactions to
 
05:28:07.470 --> 05:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
happen in a given year would take you
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
know 30 plus years for all the
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
properties in the state to necessarily
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
transact and educate all those owners
 
05:28:15.548 --> 05:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
whereas we could notify them directly
 
05:28:18.190 --> 05:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
either via Dees or directly through the
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
municipality so um apologize for going
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
off script but I hope that that uh may
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
have been a little bit more fruitful
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
based upon the conversation and I'm
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
questions

05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:28:31.520 --> 05:28:33.310 align:start position:0%
questions
any

05:28:33.310 --> 05:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:28:35.548 --> 05:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:28:37.708 --> 05:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I totally
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
understand the like you don't want the
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
form signed it sounds like Dees doesn't
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
want the form signed either um I can't
 
05:28:49.868 --> 05:28:49.878 align:start position:0%
tell quite I understand that you also
 
05:28:52.030 --> 05:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
said I'm trying to rephrase to make sure
 
05:28:53.948 --> 05:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
I understood it correctly that you said
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
that um there might be a better better
 
05:28:59.548 --> 05:28:59.558 align:start position:0%
education method than notifications but
 
05:29:02.350 --> 05:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
if there were notification ations um
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
would it uh be reasonable to you know
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
amend 4774 D which is where the
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
notifications are to include Shoreline
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
notification um and uh include a
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
reference to you know the the the best
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
guides practice which is you know the
 
05:29:20.430 --> 05:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
what's referenced here the minimum
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
standards thank you representative for
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
the question um certainly if it were to
 
05:29:24.638 --> 05:29:26.150 align:start position:0%
the question um certainly if it were to
go

05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
into the distinction I have between Ford
 
05:29:35.070 --> 05:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
C and D in 4A uh excuse me RSA 4774 a is
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
4A goes back to representative Wolf's uh
 
05:29:40.830 --> 05:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
point is this property may be in the
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
Shoreland or it may not be there there's
 
05:29:46.990 --> 05:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
a conditionality to it whereas in uh 477
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
C and D it's referencing specifically
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
this property does have this type of
 
05:29:55.150 --> 05:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
water source this it does have this type
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um I don't want to get too hung up on
 
05:30:02.590 --> 05:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
that but I I think if it were to go into
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
4 a which is the notification section
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
which then would contain arsonic lead
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
paint Ron and soon to be P so one could
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
argue yeah that that would be a good
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
place to start with a notification
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
um it it certainly would uh address the
 
05:30:25.150 --> 05:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
issue of someone who is transacting a
 
05:30:26.548 --> 05:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
property and having it disclosed
 
05:30:28.510 --> 05:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
currently Shoreline protection does
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
exist in our state disclosure form
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
already um because of the septic
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
requirements so that is on page two of
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
our four-page disclosure form so the
 
05:30:40.030 --> 05:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
buyer already is acknowledging it in
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
that location uh whether or not they
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
should have a separate location as well
 
05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
discuss representative
 
05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
Donell thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know if the
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
gis database contains the inform about
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
which properties are actually in
 
05:31:04.000 --> 05:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
which properties are actually in
Shoreline

05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
Shoreline
 
05:31:07.548 --> 05:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
protection thank you representative for
 
05:31:07.558 --> 05:31:08.270 align:start position:0%
protection thank you representative for
the

05:31:08.270 --> 05:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:10.590 --> 05:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
question I would
 
05:31:13.948 --> 05:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
say on a personal level I'm not 100%
 
05:31:17.070 --> 05:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
sure and I know I'm going to mix two
 
05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
different databases here but I know like
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
for flood insurance and that's not what
 
05:31:23.470 --> 05:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today the Army core
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
data uh has been you know historically
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
inaccurate as it relates to uh that so I
 
05:31:31.548 --> 05:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
always take the gis data with a bucket
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
of salt um and I think it's always a
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
trust put verify and I would certainly
 
05:31:38.948 --> 05:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
lean to the dees or other experts to say
 
05:31:41.670 --> 05:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not those uh GIS maps are
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
100% accurate thank you any other
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
chair and maybe going out of order um
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
Miss force can I ask you a technical
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
question because everybody keeps talking
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
about uh being on the river or being on
 
05:32:01.798 --> 05:32:02.590 align:start position:0%
about uh being on the river or being on
the

05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:05.830 --> 05:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
lake is it true that you can be under
 
05:32:08.910 --> 05:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
the Wetland the Shoreland protection act
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
and not be on it if you're so many feet
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
from it yes and it frequently frequently
 
05:32:17.430 --> 05:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
is the case the protected shorelands are
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
a distance of 250 ft from the reference
 
05:32:23.310 --> 05:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
line on a lake if it's a natural lake
 
05:32:24.910 --> 05:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
that will be the natural mean high water
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
line on an artificial
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
impoundment that is the limits of
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
Flowage so for instance to use
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake uh Newfound Lake as an
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
example Newfound lake is a natural lake
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
which I believe the elevation the
 
05:32:45.470 --> 05:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
natural elevation comes out to be
 
05:32:45.480 --> 05:32:47.670 align:start position:0%
natural elevation comes out to be
487.1

05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
487.1
 
05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
two um above datm the operating level
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
is 489 but we owe flow we own Flowage to
 
05:33:01.590 --> 05:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
490 something thing
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
so that's not exactly easy to determine
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
especially given the variability of
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake during a
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
season so uh
 
05:33:16.310 --> 05:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
in if you only own if you own one of
 
05:33:18.270 --> 05:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
those properties on newfound Lake that's
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
between for instance Westshore Road and
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
the lake that property is only 75 ft
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
deep so the person on the other side of
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
the road who's not actually against the
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
lake is also in the 250t buffer
 
05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for them to know
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
without trespassing onto the person
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
across the
 
05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
way just how
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
far that extends back on their property
 
05:33:42.910 --> 05:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's also a horizontal measurement as
 
05:33:45.150 --> 05:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
the surveyor would measure it is not
 
05:33:46.910 --> 05:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
something where you put a tape measure
 
05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
down at
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
grade so uh reference lines are variable
 
05:33:54.788 --> 05:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
based on the type of the water body on a
 
05:33:57.910 --> 05:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
river it's the ordinary high water line
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh quite honestly with the events if the
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
river floods and the you have severe
 
05:34:03.120 --> 05:34:04.190 align:start position:0%
river floods and the you have severe
bank

05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
bank
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
erosion yeah that line does move um and
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
it takes a little while for us to
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
determine what the long-term line will
 
05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
be so there's a there's an issue of
 
05:34:17.230 --> 05:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
variability sometimes in the reference
 
05:34:19.310 --> 05:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
line the question was asked about the
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
gis layer the gis layer is only as good
 
05:34:25.110 --> 05:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
as what it was based on frequently
 
05:34:30.510 --> 05:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're based on the USGS maps and those
 
05:34:33.310 --> 05:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
USGS maps were based on aerial photos
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
that I think the most recent data is
 
05:34:41.548 --> 05:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
1983 so it's somebody who is doing um
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
aerial inter aerial photo interpretation
 
05:34:46.350 --> 05:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's where the waterline was on the day
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the photo was taken as determined
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
from someone looking at it from 30,000
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
ft which experts are they're excellent
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
at it's a lot of variability um on an
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
old set of photos so
 
05:35:02.670 --> 05:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
we would tell people not to rely on our
 
05:35:05.948 --> 05:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
GIS system unless you build in at least
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
a 50 foot buffer onto the
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
buffer just to be cautious well thank
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
you very much appreciate you answering
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
that question thank
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
you Andrea Laro of New Hampshire Lakes
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill hello again good afternoon I'm
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
Andrea lro the president of New
 
05:35:33.670 --> 05:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and we are here in
 
05:35:36.670 --> 05:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
support of the intent of this bill uh
 
05:35:38.708 --> 05:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes we represent about
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
275 Lake Associations throughout the
 
05:35:45.390 --> 05:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
state um and a couple thousand uh Lake
 
05:35:47.310 --> 05:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts and there are many more
 
05:35:49.590 --> 05:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
experts in the room here today than I on
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
what what part of the law this should
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
fit into but uh we are fully supportive
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
of providing another providing a
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism of notification to new
 
05:36:00.080 --> 05:36:00.948 align:start position:0%
mechanism of notification to new
Property

05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
Property
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
Owners um to raise awareness about the
 
05:36:05.868 --> 05:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
Shoreland protection act and the
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
Shoreland protection act in its entir it
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
extends much more than a septic systems
 
05:36:13.708 --> 05:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh for those property owners who do read
 
05:36:15.990 --> 05:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
all the forms when in closing and I
 
05:36:18.270 --> 05:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
happen to be one of them um there may be
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
some others like me who would read all
 
05:36:22.750 --> 05:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
the forms and find out something that's
 
05:36:26.110 --> 05:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
really useful to them find out how uh
 
05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
they can live in a lake friendly way how
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
they can manage their property in a lake
 
05:36:33.390 --> 05:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
friendly way and a legal way to help
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
protect their investment along that
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
beautiful water body whether it be a
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
river or a lake or whatnot um and could
 
05:36:42.910 --> 05:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
could also help them stay out of trouble
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
um I've heard some great comments today
 
05:36:48.830 --> 05:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
about you know how this may not be you
 
05:36:50.230 --> 05:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
know effective with every single
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
property owner but at this point you
 
05:36:54.670 --> 05:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
know it takes some folks what they
 
05:36:56.548 --> 05:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
saying seven times to hear something to
 
05:36:58.510 --> 05:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
really learn it and internalize it and
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
this is just another way we think of
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
helping people understand um the act and
 
05:37:06.750 --> 05:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
again how it how it can benefit them and
 
05:37:08.750 --> 05:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
um benefit the the lake or the water
 
05:37:11.708 --> 05:37:11.718 align:start position:0%
body they near so I encourage uh again
 
05:37:13.230 --> 05:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
the experts in the room to figure out
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
the best way to make this this happen
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
but again we support the intent of it
 
05:37:20.270 --> 05:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
05:37:30.670 --> 05:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
you and my final pink card Jason stock

05:37:41.948 --> 05:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.590 --> 05:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill good good afternoon good to see you
 
05:37:47.070 --> 05:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
again after lunch um I'll be really
 
05:37:50.390 --> 05:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
brief we our policy committee re
 
05:37:52.670 --> 05:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed this and you know we do have
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
property owners that do have land raw
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
Timberland that does have you know as
 
05:38:00.430 --> 05:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier a bus of river or
 
05:38:03.150 --> 05:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
would be would be kind of shorefront
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
property and
 
05:38:07.390 --> 05:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
so when we reviewed it in that
 
05:38:10.510 --> 05:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
context um you know our thought thought
 
05:38:12.510 --> 05:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
was you know this adds another provision
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the real estate transaction and not
 
05:38:17.310 --> 05:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
unlike the discussion we had earlier
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
this is we see this as an issue of
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
education and mandating another document
 
05:38:23.760 --> 05:38:24.868 align:start position:0%
education and mandating another document
another

05:38:24.868 --> 05:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:38:27.590 --> 05:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
notice um we have to believe there's
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
another way to do this um
 
05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
that instead of just mandating another
 
05:38:35.468 --> 05:38:35.478 align:start position:0%
requirement that as you heard earlier
 
05:38:38.990 --> 05:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
could or could could not be used as a
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
point of liability or something that
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
could hang up who knows but again we
 
05:38:46.510 --> 05:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
just looked at this and thought there
 
05:38:51.070 --> 05:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
has to be another element of this and
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
you know for that reason we just said
 
05:38:56.110 --> 05:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
look you know we're happy to work with
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
anyone that wants to look at this but
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
again we just couldn't support yet
 
05:39:02.830 --> 05:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
another mandate that it really wasn't
 
05:39:05.670 --> 05:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
clear that it's necessary and that there
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be a better way than the
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
state coming in and saying thou sh um
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know even if I own a piece of
 
05:39:15.190 --> 05:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
Timberland I sell it to another
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
Timberland investor I'm not sure what
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're I I won't I won't know what they
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
are going to do with it presumably
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
they'll own it and continue to manage it
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
as Timber but if they decide to put a
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
camp on it I'm not a mind reader I'm not
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
going to know that and again we don't
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
want to run into a situation we'll say
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
gez I didn't give them a notice cuz I
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to just manage
 
05:39:37.150 --> 05:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
it for growing
 
05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
trees and turns out they didn't so
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
having said that I don't have a whole
 
05:39:44.350 --> 05:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
lot to add to the concerns and
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion that occurred earlier but
 
05:39:48.670 --> 05:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
happy to continue the dialogue with you
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:55.230 --> 05:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:39:57.468 --> 05:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that was easy thank you okay I
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards about
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
call it out is there anyone else to
 
05:40:03.750 --> 05:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
speak on HB
 
05:40:06.910 --> 05:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
1229 second call anyone else to speak on
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
hb1 1229 seeing no one approaching the
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
mic I'll close the hearing on HB 1229
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
and at 3:00 we'll start the hearing on
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.240 --> 06:00:16.350 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:00:16.350 --> 06:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:18.430 --> 06:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
says come on we're at the 3:00 hour
 
06:00:21.548 --> 06:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a hearing on HB 1249
 
06:00:23.390 --> 06:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll call up the prime sponsor
 
06:00:23.400 --> 06:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
and we'll call up the prime sponsor
representative

06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%

Spain
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee and
 
06:00:35.030 --> 06:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for uh hearing my bill uh I
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
brought this I'm not a I don't own a
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
boat and I don't water ski uh I've done
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of power snorkeling because I
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't get up on the skis and just got
 
06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
pulled underwat behind them but um but I
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
met a constituent on the golf course
 
06:00:52.110 --> 06:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
this last summer and um he started
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
talking to me about the confusion in the
 
06:00:56.270 --> 06:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
current RSA and the way that it's
 
06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
written up and I looked at it and I I
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
agreed it wasn't it was kind of vague in
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of areas for when you're towing an
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
inflatable and the RSA was written
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
focused mainly on water skiers and that
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
makes sense because it's from quite a
 
06:01:13.868 --> 06:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
long time ago and things have been added
 
06:01:16.670 --> 06:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
over the time aquaplanes and stuff have
 
06:01:18.628 --> 06:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
been added over the years there was
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that specifically
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
addressed the Inflatables and there was
 
06:01:24.990 --> 06:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
confusion where the law had been changed
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
to allow if you have up to six people
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
people being towed you need two spotters
 
06:01:33.868 --> 06:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
but if you have three you only need one
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
and that was a change made many years
 
06:01:37.948 --> 06:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
ago but the question was well if I've
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
got three people on One inflatable why
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
am I being told sometimes by the officer
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
that I need to have a second Spotter and
 
06:01:47.468 --> 06:01:47.478 align:start position:0%
other times the officer thinks that's
 
06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
fine I said well we can clarify that and
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
we can also add in a safety measure to
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
say no more than two Inflatables should
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
be towed behind the boat at any time cuz
 
06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
that lines up with the two water skiers
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
that you can pull unless you have a
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
special permit so what I tried to do uh
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
was add in language that clarified when
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
you need one spotter when you need two
 
06:02:09.990 --> 06:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
spotters and how many Inflatables you
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
can pull behind yourself while keeping
 
06:02:13.788 --> 06:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
the safety
 
06:02:16.270 --> 06:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
intact and since this is not my area of
 
06:02:17.468 --> 06:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
expertise if there's anything the
 
06:02:19.708 --> 06:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
committee thinks could be worded better
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
or changed I have no problem with an
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um I am strictly here to try
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify that RSA so that we can
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
include those Inflatables that are so
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
popular on the Lakes now and make sure
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
that uh there's no confusion between the
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
boers and the law enforcement and the
 
06:02:40.868 --> 06:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
RSA and I'll take any questions if you
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
have them any questions for the
 
06:02:45.708 --> 06:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Spain for taking my
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
question one um minor concern I have
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
with the wording um is that it says um
 
06:02:59.468 --> 06:02:59.478 align:start position:0%
no more than two persons shall be towed
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
on water skis aquaplanes or other
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
devices but then the very next line as
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
as the bill states it is when three or
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
more persons are being towed on water
 
06:03:12.270 --> 06:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
skis aquaplanes or other devices um so
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
that seems to be contradicted and I
 
06:03:15.868 --> 06:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for that line to be put in
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
there they did that uh at OSS in part of
 
06:03:19.600 --> 06:03:20.548 align:start position:0%
there they did that uh at OSS in part of
their

06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
clarification and I don't quite
 
06:03:23.628 --> 06:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
understand that either because when it
 
06:03:26.788 --> 06:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
was changed to allow the six people for
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
two spots ERS with the no more than six
 
06:03:31.788 --> 06:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
persons could be towed on one or more
 
06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
inflatable tubes uh or two persons on
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
water skis
 
06:03:39.310 --> 06:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
aquaplanes that was pretty clear to me
 
06:03:41.788 --> 06:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
so I don't know why they put the three
 
06:03:43.390 --> 06:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
persons Toad on and that's why I said
 
06:03:43.400 --> 06:03:45.830 align:start position:0%
persons Toad on and that's why I said
this

06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
is so yes followup thank you for the
 
06:03:51.070 --> 06:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
followup I I just mentioned as well if
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
we go to the very last so I think you're
 
06:03:55.030 --> 06:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
correct I my hunch is or I just did it
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
because they thought was that was right
 
06:03:59.708 --> 06:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
but the very last line of the says not
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
not withstanding this paragraph uh two
 
06:04:05.230 --> 06:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
or more two uh more than two skiers now
 
06:04:06.910 --> 06:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about water skiers
 
06:04:09.390 --> 06:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
yes maybe toad if a special permit is
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
issued so I don't think that um I don't
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
think that it was the intent was you
 
06:04:16.590 --> 06:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
know you could tow two people ski with
 
06:04:19.868 --> 06:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
one with one spot or originally would
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
you agree I would agree yeah okay thank
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
you and
 
06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh as you can see a lot of that was
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
already language they just added in that
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
extra bit okay thanks a
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
lot representative M Ju Just a comment I
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that that the elsewhere it
 
06:04:39.868 --> 06:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
says you have to have an
 
06:04:42.150 --> 06:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
observer right and then but if it's
 
06:04:44.910 --> 06:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
three or more so or more than two that's
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
where I think in 270 it
 
06:04:49.948 --> 06:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
does and I and I think uh we have an
 
06:04:51.468 --> 06:04:51.478 align:start position:0%
industry expert in the room and maybe
 
06:04:54.350 --> 06:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
she'll clarify it or I'll bring up 270
 
06:04:56.190 --> 06:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
but I think the intent is with that
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
language is when it's more than two or
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
same as three or more that's when you
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
need two
 
06:05:03.708 --> 06:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
observers right because you can't have a
 
06:05:03.718 --> 06:05:09.430 align:start position:0%
observers right because you can't have a
half

06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
person I guess that was the end of that
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
question representative fail you have a
 
06:05:20.270 --> 06:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
question yeah that question um so my
 
06:05:22.990 --> 06:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
question just changed into um so you're
 
06:05:25.708 --> 06:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
willing to amend the bills ABS it's not
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise and I would would
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome uh input from from you
 
06:05:33.030 --> 06:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
guys to make this right I think it just
 
06:05:34.830 --> 06:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
just it's very ambiguous the way that it
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
all is right now and uh and there was no
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
specific limit on how many Inflatables
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
could be towed uh anything more than two
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have lines Tangled
 
06:05:45.868 --> 06:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
and things so I think for safety reasons
 
06:05:47.670 --> 06:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
we need to put that in there along with
 
06:05:47.680 --> 06:05:48.708 align:start position:0%
we need to put that in there along with
the

06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you so much I mean
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like it has
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
organizational problems but it does look
 
06:05:54.240 --> 06:05:55.708 align:start position:0%
organizational problems but it does look
doable

06:05:55.708 --> 06:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
doable
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
too any anyone new to ask a
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
question s n representative
 
06:06:06.350 --> 06:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you just one more um do you
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
have a the way I read this is um you
 
06:06:13.270 --> 06:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
could have some of those tubes are big
 
06:06:14.910 --> 06:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
right I mean you you can put four kids
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
on some of those especially four smaller
 
06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
kids on some of those tubes um and why
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm reading is if you got four kids on
 
06:06:23.230 --> 06:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
one tube you would have one spot it was
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
that do you think that was that's
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
correct I was having them write it up
 
06:06:28.590 --> 06:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
for one spotter per inflatable being
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
towed okay thank you and uh so that's
 
06:06:33.670 --> 06:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
the way that I had had them do it yes
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to make sure I
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
understood the in thank
 
06:06:40.030 --> 06:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
06:06:42.600 --> 06:06:45.468 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
thank

06:06:45.468 --> 06:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
you uh Sergeant ali uh Department of
 
06:06:51.390 --> 06:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
Safety Marine Patrol uh speaking against
 
06:06:51.400 --> 06:06:52.590 align:start position:0%
Safety Marine Patrol uh speaking against
the

06:06:52.590 --> 06:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:52.600 --> 06:06:54.830 align:start position:0%
the
bill

06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Mr chair the Department of
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
Safety Division of State Police New
 
06:07:01.548 --> 06:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol is in oppose to
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um we feel that there is some
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
safety concerns as it relates to having
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
those observers out there to assist with
 
06:07:12.510 --> 06:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
those injuries I I know some of you
 
06:07:14.830 --> 06:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
folks heard me speak before referencing
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh no observers for the boat or the
 
06:07:19.868 --> 06:07:19.878 align:start position:0%
mirror um I think this mirror not the
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
play on words there but mirror is that
 
06:07:25.230 --> 06:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
same type of uh analogy where in if in
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
fact you do have as it was explained two
 
06:07:30.468 --> 06:07:30.478 align:start position:0%
tubes out there with four on one tube
 
06:07:33.990 --> 06:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
and two on another tube and only having
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
one Observer or if in fact we stick with
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
the two
 
06:07:39.868 --> 06:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
observers I still feel there is some
 
06:07:41.468 --> 06:07:41.478 align:start position:0%
safety concerns there the state has
 
06:07:43.230 --> 06:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
passed it it's gone to committees the
 
06:07:45.628 --> 06:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
camps in such not back in
 
06:07:48.628 --> 06:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
2011 with legislation passed with Camp
 
06:07:50.910 --> 06:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
directors and the Marine trades to make
 
06:07:53.868 --> 06:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
it so that if you have up to six tubes
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
you only need two observers um and I'm
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
sorry uh and I I feel that there are
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
some safety concerns when uh when we
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
start to break that down and and I would
 
06:08:08.990 --> 06:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
also speak to that uh the water skiing
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that we've always had the stance of no
 
06:08:14.910 --> 06:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
more than two water skiers and to have
 
06:08:20.230 --> 06:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
that thank you Sergeant any questions
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
for the sergeant representative hgan
 
06:08:26.548 --> 06:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:08:28.468 --> 06:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I thought I just
 
06:08:31.708 --> 06:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
heard you say that you could tow six
 
06:08:34.468 --> 06:08:34.478 align:start position:0%
tubes yes sir under the current statue
 
06:08:37.390 --> 06:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
right now you can tow one tube with six
 
06:08:40.150 --> 06:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
people on it or six tubes with a person
 
06:08:44.750 --> 06:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
you representative mchu thank you Mr
 
06:08:50.270 --> 06:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just reading the current statute
 
06:08:56.468 --> 06:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
and it seems like this proposed change
 
06:08:58.510 --> 06:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
does clarify it it it says no more than
 
06:09:00.510 --> 06:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
six persons May Toad on one or more
 
06:09:02.670 --> 06:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
inflatable tubes and no two more no more
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
than two persons on water skis aquip
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
ples or other devices when three or more
 
06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
persons are being towed to observers in
 
06:09:11.708 --> 06:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
addition to the operator doesn't it make
 
06:09:13.150 --> 06:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
sense so my question is doesn't it make
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
sense to clarify it by adding this new
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
language doesn't that make it
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
better I wouldn't disagree but I just I
 
06:09:23.230 --> 06:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
I think we obviously as a group and I
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
apologize first time here D but making
 
06:09:28.350 --> 06:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
sure water skis don't get caught up in
 
06:09:31.230 --> 06:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
into this bill to have then ie6 water
 
06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
ski is out there I think we can agree to
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
that I think when we start to
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
go as I read it for inflatables only one
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
Observer is required when using only one
 
06:09:45.030 --> 06:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
inflatable and two observers for two
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
Inflatables but no more than two
 
06:09:49.230 --> 06:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
Inflatables if in fact you have two
 
06:09:51.350 --> 06:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
Inflatables and I don't disagree reading
 
06:09:52.948 --> 06:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:09:55.830 --> 06:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
statue the state opposes it you know you
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
you're having people two
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
tubes again I wasn't here to to speak on
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
that for question back in 2011 follow up
 
06:10:07.990 --> 06:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
now I understand what you mean um so
 
06:10:10.670 --> 06:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's not two observers two Inflatables
 
06:10:13.230 --> 06:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's potentially having two observers
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
and 12 people spread across two
 
06:10:19.390 --> 06:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
Inflatables no you can't tow I'm sorry
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
to clarification no more than six people
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
may be towed on any other apparatus
 
06:10:28.510 --> 06:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
other than water skis so in 2011 through
 
06:10:31.548 --> 06:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
legislation through camps Marine trade
 
06:10:35.070 --> 06:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
and uh in the state it came back to
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
being no more than six people on IE six
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
tubes or one tube with six people on it
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
observers am I not am I'm
 
06:10:50.270 --> 06:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
sorry this seems to make it more clear I
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
mean everything else is already in
 
06:10:53.788 --> 06:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
statute such observers shall be 13 years
 
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding special permit for a lot
 
06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
of skiers all that that's all there this
 
06:11:00.190 --> 06:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
just makes it more clear that if you got
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
two Inflatables you have to have one
 
06:11:02.708 --> 06:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
Observer for each seems like that's a
 
06:11:04.670 --> 06:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
good safety
 
06:11:06.990 --> 06:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
thing I don't disagree but does the
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
statute not limit them to no more than
 
06:11:09.120 --> 06:11:10.310 align:start position:0%
statute not limit them to no more than
two

06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
tubers correct me if I'm wrong current
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
statute says when three or more persons
 
06:11:19.070 --> 06:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
are being towed doesn't specify this
 
06:11:21.230 --> 06:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation does clarify
 
06:11:23.670 --> 06:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
it so it actually makes it more clear
 
06:11:24.910 --> 06:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
says when three more when three or more
 
06:11:26.390 --> 06:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
persons are being towed two observers in
 
06:11:28.468 --> 06:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
a addition to the operator shall be in
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
the towing vessel to observers
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
everything else is existing statute I
 
06:11:36.468 --> 06:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
just look at the amend or the amend to
 
06:11:38.670 --> 06:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
here to put but no more than two
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
Inflatables may be towed at a time
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
current statute would say you are
 
06:11:47.070 --> 06:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to tow six apparatuses wow okay
 
06:11:48.590 --> 06:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
so so which do you think is better two
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
or six I I don't I my as a state
 
06:11:54.750 --> 06:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
represents that we oppose this
 
06:11:58.270 --> 06:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
06:12:01.310 --> 06:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
Arby okay but um thank you thank you Mr
 
06:12:03.430 --> 06:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:12:06.670 --> 06:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
um I was under the impression that um
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety was opposing it
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
because the um number of um observers
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
was less than sometimes significantly
 
06:12:17.548 --> 06:12:17.558 align:start position:0%
less potentially than the number of
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
people being towed and there weren't
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
enough people to you know help if
 
06:12:24.350 --> 06:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
somebody was injured as opposed to being
 
06:12:26.548 --> 06:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because you it was limited
 
06:12:30.270 --> 06:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
to two towables instead of six
 
06:12:32.868 --> 06:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
towables I wouldn't disagree with any of
 
06:12:34.390 --> 06:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
the comments that are being made here
 
06:12:37.070 --> 06:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
but as it stands you're allowed to tow
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
six people on One apparatus or six
 
06:12:43.948 --> 06:12:43.958 align:start position:0%
apparatuses back as I said in 2011
 
06:12:45.628 --> 06:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
through my notes that were disseminated
 
06:12:49.310 --> 06:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
to me to speak on this prior to 2011 it
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
was one for one I enforced one for one
 
06:12:54.350 --> 06:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I could go on many tangents of how I
 
06:12:56.190 --> 06:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
would deal with the public out there who
 
06:12:58.030 --> 06:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
you going to save of your four kids on
 
06:13:00.310 --> 06:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
one tube with one Observer oh Jimmy you
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
don't like them let them go that has
 
06:13:05.910 --> 06:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
changed to in 2011 now you are only
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
required to have two observers for six
 
06:13:14.468 --> 06:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm sorry come again
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
sir I I think the question sergeant if I
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
could rephrase it for you I think the
 
06:13:25.948 --> 06:13:25.958 align:start position:0%
question is how many observers does the
 
06:13:25.958 --> 06:13:27.548 align:start position:0%
question is how many observers does the
department

06:13:27.548 --> 06:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
think you should have with
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
Inflatables however you determine six on
 
06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
one or six with one on each uh this
 
06:13:40.030 --> 06:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Spain's
 
06:13:42.628 --> 06:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify talks about how many
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
observers so that's why they asked are
 
06:13:48.628 --> 06:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
you in favor or not it's like what would
 
06:13:51.548 --> 06:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
the department like for a number of
 
06:13:55.070 --> 06:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
observers with Inflatables Mr chair back
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
this was block to the legislative board
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
to clarify from one for one and at that
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
point the camp directors the Marine
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
trades Association and Marine Patrol
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the legislation board came to this
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
realization we're going to allow six and
 
06:14:12.400 --> 06:14:14.468 align:start position:0%
realization we're going to allow six and
two

06:14:14.468 --> 06:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:14:16.830 --> 06:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
observers and you like
 
06:14:20.750 --> 06:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
that in front of you right now recorded
 
06:14:23.750 --> 06:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
no but that's not for me to say I have
 
06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
documentations of this is how I that's
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
what I thought thought it sounded like
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
you didn't like the current law but this
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
proposal makes it it sounds like more to
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
your liking I don't just by what you're
 
06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
saying I would can I speak on that if
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like I I I can speak to that only
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
because I don't like one for three it's
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
one for three you have one Observer for
 
06:14:52.150 --> 06:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
three on this amended bill in my eyes is
 
06:14:54.430 --> 06:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
all it's it's done is gone from six
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
tubes to two tubes that's all I see it
 
06:14:58.910 --> 06:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
changing from It's Always still going to
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
have two observers which I still fall
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
back on to Seth alley not Department of
 
06:15:07.628 --> 06:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
Safety one for one if I fall in the
 
06:15:09.750 --> 06:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
water I want one of you to come rescue
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
me and if my wife's on board I want
 
06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
someone else to hop in and now I add my
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
son on the back I want someone to hop in
 
06:15:17.628 --> 06:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
to save
 
06:15:19.548 --> 06:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
them but in
 
06:15:22.430 --> 06:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
2011 the legislative board Marine trades
 
06:15:26.830 --> 06:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
and Marine Patrol try to make it
 
06:15:28.590 --> 06:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
better for the Marine trades for The
 
06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
Aquatic paraphernalia out there and it
 
06:15:36.510 --> 06:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:40.150 --> 06:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
six and if I can ask you a question
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
Sergeant but representative Spain has
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
firm Inflatables only one Observer when
 
06:15:50.548 --> 06:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
towing one inflatable but the first part
 
06:15:53.230 --> 06:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
says I can have six people on the
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
inflatable so he's actually limiting
 
06:15:59.230 --> 06:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
lessening the amount of observers as far
 
06:16:01.430 --> 06:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
as you're concerned yes I would okay
 
06:16:04.590 --> 06:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's why you're opposed
 
06:16:08.310 --> 06:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay I got it thank you representative
 
06:16:14.350 --> 06:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
Ron thank you Mr chair so in on line um
 
06:16:17.110 --> 06:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
seven or end of six it says two
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
Inflatables but no more than two
 
06:16:21.948 --> 06:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
Inflatables may be towed at a time so
 
06:16:24.310 --> 06:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
with two Inflatables is that just
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
limited to one onone in current statute
 
06:16:29.788 --> 06:16:29.798 align:start position:0%
because if you have six on one or one
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
for six
 
06:16:34.230 --> 06:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
Inflatables would it be like three for
 
06:16:36.670 --> 06:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
two like so if you have two Inflatables
 
06:16:39.390 --> 06:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
is the maximum number of people six
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
still so would you have three on each of
 
06:16:41.520 --> 06:16:43.150 align:start position:0%
still so would you have three on each of
those

06:16:43.150 --> 06:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:16:46.350 --> 06:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
Inflatables I can only speak to as I see
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
it we have apparatuses that are put out
 
06:16:51.948 --> 06:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
there from a marine trades to say hey
 
06:16:54.190 --> 06:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
this holds two people can you put three
 
06:16:56.590 --> 06:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
kids on that yes you can
 
06:16:59.830 --> 06:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
the designed for two people there are
 
06:17:01.708 --> 06:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
hot dog tubes if you would call them
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
that will hold up to six people with
 
06:17:06.110 --> 06:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
this current statue as Mr chair has
 
06:17:08.190 --> 06:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
brought up you are now saying one
 
06:17:10.948 --> 06:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
inflatable one person which in fact
 
06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
could be six people on it as I read so
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair go ahead okay so with
 
06:17:20.670 --> 06:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
the two Inflatables it's specified here
 
06:17:22.708 --> 06:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
okay that would require two
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
observers those two Inflatables are you
 
06:17:27.670 --> 06:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
saying that each one of those can hold
 
06:17:27.680 --> 06:17:29.350 align:start position:0%
saying that each one of those can hold
six

06:17:29.350 --> 06:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
six
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
no there the statute States you can tow
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
no more than six people you can't have
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
six on one tube and six on that because
 
06:17:42.190 --> 06:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
now you're towing 12 it's six no matter
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
what however you mix and match and make
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
up your six you can do I got it two on
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
one tube three on one tube and one on
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
another tube okay so with the two you
 
06:17:54.670 --> 06:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
could have five on one one on the other
 
06:17:56.430 --> 06:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
as long as it doesn't
 
06:17:58.708 --> 06:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
six got it thank
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
06:18:04.468 --> 06:18:04.478 align:start position:0%
sergeant one more
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't think it limits you it
 
06:18:09.868 --> 06:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
says no more than six persons may be
 
06:18:13.070 --> 06:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
towed on one or more inflatable tubes
 
06:18:14.468 --> 06:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
where does how does that limit you to
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
six if you
 
06:18:17.708 --> 06:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
have two
 
06:18:20.070 --> 06:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
Inflatables in the in the proposed statu
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
here yeah or or in current statute
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
because I'm reading current statute and
 
06:18:26.750 --> 06:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the part of the proposed
 
06:18:29.628 --> 06:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
bill that's from current statute it
 
06:18:32.430 --> 06:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
looks like there isn't a limit you got
 
06:18:35.948 --> 06:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
have six times two is 12 have 12 which
 
06:18:38.310 --> 06:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
is that would be a bit
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
crazy I mean so if we made it if we
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
fixed the language to make it one for
 
06:18:45.430 --> 06:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
one one one like so you said so you
 
06:18:46.990 --> 06:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to pick between your wife or
 
06:18:49.510 --> 06:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
your kid would that be
 
06:18:52.110 --> 06:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
better the state opposes this current
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill oh my God I got that I got that
 
06:18:57.948 --> 06:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
part sir I don't he's not going to make
 
06:19:02.030 --> 06:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
opinion let's not ask him you know I all
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
right representative sorry thank you
 
06:19:08.628 --> 06:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one more so after we
 
06:19:10.510 --> 06:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
go that line that every was questioning
 
06:19:12.990 --> 06:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
on it says when three or more persons
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
are being told you need to have two
 
06:19:19.708 --> 06:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
observers so if you have the six with
 
06:19:22.270 --> 06:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
one Observer you wouldn't be able to do
 
06:19:25.390 --> 06:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
that it says right there when three or
 
06:19:27.190 --> 06:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
more persons are being
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
towed you must have two
 
06:19:34.948 --> 06:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
observers that's that does includ it
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
says it on all all the devices in all
 
06:19:38.320 --> 06:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
says it on all all the devices in all
the

06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:41.868 --> 06:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
devices if you want to put it flatables
 
06:19:43.230 --> 06:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine too but I'm just saying it
 
06:19:44.708 --> 06:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
does say on other devices so it says if
 
06:19:46.110 --> 06:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
you have more than three people you have
 
06:19:47.110 --> 06:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:19:51.310 --> 06:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
two like that I I would just as I look
 
06:19:52.990 --> 06:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
at the Amendments that are in there for
 
06:19:56.190 --> 06:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
inflatables only one Observer is re when
 
06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
toing only one
 
06:20:01.270 --> 06:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
inflatable which in theory could that
 
06:20:03.788 --> 06:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
hold up to six people and I I don't just
 
06:20:06.788 --> 06:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
agree with if if in fact they had six on
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
it they would have to have two and
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
that's what it actually says in line on
 
06:20:11.310 --> 06:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
line four when it says when three or
 
06:20:13.510 --> 06:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
more persons are being told you have to
 
06:20:13.520 --> 06:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
more persons are being told you have to
have

06:20:15.030 --> 06:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
two I wouldn't disagree disagree with
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I got a simple
 
06:20:26.350 --> 06:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
sentence if it's a question to ask them
 
06:20:28.590 --> 06:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
would it be more clear if this statute
 
06:20:31.990 --> 06:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
just said for every person being towed
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
there was one there is one Observer
 
06:20:35.910 --> 06:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of what they're being towed
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
on for every person being towed there's
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
one observer in the in the towboat and
 
06:20:42.750 --> 06:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
then not withstanding this paragraph
 
06:20:45.030 --> 06:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
special permit water show whatever you
 
06:20:47.230 --> 06:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
know would would that make this all
 
06:20:49.350 --> 06:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
simpler if we just changed all of it
 
06:20:51.708 --> 06:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
deleted at all made it for every person
 
06:20:54.350 --> 06:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
being towed there's one Observer can I
 
06:20:57.788 --> 06:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
make a funny he said one no sorry um no
 
06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
in the statute make the statute one make
 
06:21:02.110 --> 06:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
the statute one sentence all I can refer
 
06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
back to is in my 27 years with the
 
06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety working from 18 to
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
now as a marine patrol officer and now
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
IE Sergeant back prior to
 
06:21:17.430 --> 06:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
2011 it was one for one something
 
06:21:19.750 --> 06:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
happened and and again I don't I I
 
06:21:21.708 --> 06:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't yes it matters to me because I
 
06:21:23.788 --> 06:21:23.798 align:start position:0%
take my job very passionately but
 
06:21:26.670 --> 06:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
something through legislation said in
 
06:21:29.948 --> 06:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
2011 we are going from one for one we're
 
06:21:32.590 --> 06:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
going to do two for
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
six how about one more question for the
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
sergeant because I think you're getting
 
06:21:38.868 --> 06:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
into the meat of the article rather than
 
06:21:41.150 --> 06:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
asking them questions so if it's a
 
06:21:42.070 --> 06:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
question actually going to go a
 
06:21:43.468 --> 06:21:43.478 align:start position:0%
completely different angle here I'm not
 
06:21:46.270 --> 06:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
going to talk about tax at all um thank
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
you for uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:21:51.070 --> 06:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um the sponsor um
 
06:21:53.468 --> 06:21:53.478 align:start position:0%
said that they were um his constituent
 
06:21:56.468 --> 06:21:56.478 align:start position:0%
had um received contradictory
 
06:21:57.868 --> 06:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
information at least that's what I
 
06:22:00.548 --> 06:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
understood um from different um Marine
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
Patrol um officers in terms of the
 
06:22:06.310 --> 06:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
number of spotters I'm wondering how you
 
06:22:09.910 --> 06:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
know um if there are rules about you
 
06:22:12.190 --> 06:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
know that specifically State how this is
 
06:22:13.948 --> 06:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced and how this is
 
06:22:16.590 --> 06:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
shared by you know Marine Patrol and and
 
06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
the summer Patrol as well that comes on
 
06:22:22.948 --> 06:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
part-time yeah so great question I think
 
06:22:26.430 --> 06:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
that as it's been deciphered to me
 
06:22:28.270 --> 06:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
when this first went into effect it was
 
06:22:30.070 --> 06:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire M officers don't write
 
06:22:32.590 --> 06:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
tickets on this go out there educate do
 
06:22:35.430 --> 06:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
I think that when we see a stop sign
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
that says stop we all know that that
 
06:22:39.910 --> 06:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
means stop but do I think that there are
 
06:22:42.868 --> 06:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
some confusions when I'm out on his
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
constituent Lake and oh my God I see one
 
06:22:47.468 --> 06:22:47.478 align:start position:0%
tube and and oh man I remember the
 
06:22:50.430 --> 06:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
safety concerns was hey one for one do I
 
06:22:51.788 --> 06:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
think there was some confusion do I
 
06:22:54.190 --> 06:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
think that those officers we all make
 
06:22:56.310 --> 06:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes I think think we've gotten
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
better at it but I still think there's
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
obviously mistakes can happen um I can
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
only Advocate that we have an all Hands
 
06:23:05.788 --> 06:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
Day prior to the kickoff of the season
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we'd go over any law updates and
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
obviously this is one that was obviously
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
brought up because I remember it very
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
bially but I think there is some always
 
06:23:18.868 --> 06:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:22.350 --> 06:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
to any other
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Sergeant
 
06:23:27.110 --> 06:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
for your test testimony and I would hope
 
06:23:28.830 --> 06:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
someone would work with representative
 
06:23:31.868 --> 06:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
Spain who's admitted that the bill needs
 
06:23:33.830 --> 06:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment so that you might get an
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in uh quickly because um my
 
06:23:39.510 --> 06:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is this bill is on for
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
exact next
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
week all the bills we did today I
 
06:23:46.830 --> 06:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
believe uh the chair has put on plus
 
06:23:49.230 --> 06:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
other bills we did before so if you have
 
06:23:51.548 --> 06:23:51.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment on this bill um it would be
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
nice to get it in as soon as possible
 
06:23:56.868 --> 06:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
even as a draft and then bring copies to
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
