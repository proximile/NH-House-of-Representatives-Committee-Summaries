00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
been a thrilled driving the road today
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
hasn't it you know with all that rain or
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
snow or slush um today is a day in which
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
we're setting all the bills that are
 
00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
oriented around finance and budget and
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy not policy inadequate but
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
primarily the budgeting for uh the
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
costing of an adequate education and
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
before we start I want everybody to
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand that we do have a
 
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's already been
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
appointed to look at these four bills
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
the paperwork is over on the sides so
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
everybody could grab a cop if you want
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will be meeting
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at
 
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
10:00 and the subcommitte comprises six
 
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
people from policy two people from
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
finance and two people from Ways and
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
Means and so it's a working group that's
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
been set up uh between the speaker
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
myself and and representative Wilhelm
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
and so it's a bipartisan group there
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
will be five Republicans five Democrats
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
on that particular group and we want to
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
do a really conscientious look at these
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
four bills and and um hopefully we can
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
come up with some resolution here um
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
today I know folks are you know need to
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
get right on it one of you has to get on
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
a plane here at by 10:00 so we'll try to
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish that so I want to get right
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
into uh HB
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
1583 this is relative to per P cost of
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
anade opportunity for an adequate
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
education and the prime sponsor that
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
Bill Wheeler represent wheeler is
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler here right here Mr
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman right oh
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
CH I'm quick you made it exactly yes
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay with the snow thank you Mr chairman
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I represent the
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
towns of Peter bro and Sharon uh I I
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
prime sponsored HB 1583 because right
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
now how New Hampshire is funding their
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
schools is
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh the base adequacy
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
Falls uh significantly short of what the
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
actual cost of education is um the local
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
school districts found that that would
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
be somewhere around $24,000 per pupil uh
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
in the year 2022 2023 school year uh
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
right now the base adequacy for our
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
students is $4,100 per student um that
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
is significantly under what the school
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
districts themselves found in the last
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
school year uh the appropriate base
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy would be for our
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
students based on the work of conval
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent Kim believe of sers who
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
was right behind me here who's my old
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent you know it's a little
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
bit weird to be colleagues now that
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
we're now that we're here but um uh you
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
know as I mentioned
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
she and her work in the conval lawsuit
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh based and came up with uh a $10,000
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
number basing that off of
 
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.589 align:start position:0%
number basing that off of
um

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
uh similar metrics that were used before
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
but not including other metrics that
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
would be important and um this $9,900
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
that had been uh formulated based on the
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit uh didn't include
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
non-classroom Services which are
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to ensure students
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
can actually access you know instruction
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
namely transportation
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
School nurses you know Food Services um
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
building and Facilities costs and other
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
things and schools cannot operate with
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy that it is right now
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that everyone on the
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
committee understands that and that's
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
why we're we're moving forward with
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on that level um
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent after superintendent
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
testified that they would not be able to
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
operate on this current budget and we
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
need to increase the base adequacy to
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
invest in our students to invest in
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
their education and to invest in our
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
state's future uh if our students are
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
not invested in then how can they feel
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they're going to stay here how can
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
they feel uh educated to be able to go
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
out into the world as uh a full member
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the workforce and and I think it's
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
clear that $4,100 per student is not uh
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
an adequate amount to be able to fund
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
them so hopefully uh My Hope in funding
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
in filing HB 1583 is that we can find
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
some mechanism of funding to be able
 
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.829 align:start position:0%
some mechanism of funding to be able
to

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
address this situation in a coherent way
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
everything good up
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
there okay um so thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
I happy to take any questions that the
 
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee has I'll I'll keep that brief
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
I have to also get to my own committee
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
um but I would hope that throughout this
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee process and throughout the
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
process of the next year we can find in
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan way some uh adequate way to
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
fund our our kids in our schools uh here
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you very much
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
here um we do have a subcommittee
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%

the 19th and there we'll be meeting we
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
have spoken to some of the uh Prime
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
Movers On on this bill ardinger
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
representative Ames um others which will
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
be giving uh more lengthy reports at at
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting so today what
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do with a testimony here is
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
I I I would encourage you not to
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
replicate what somebody has already said
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
and there will be a limit of three
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
minutes not for the person presenting
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
the bills that person has you know the
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
latitude to present their bills and try
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
to um inform all of what that bill
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
entails but we will have to have a time
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
limit due to the number of bills which
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
we have here and the people want to um
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
speak today so with that are there any
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
questions of of the representative yes
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
representa leus and then others
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
um as I will assume you're
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
aware we give money in addition to that
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
minimal amount in lots of other funding
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
formulas and ways that go in addition
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if the 10,000 that you
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
came up with takes into consideration
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
those extra monies that we're already
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
giving to like towns that have
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
um lower property values and stuff like
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
that does that take into consideration
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
that or is that in addition to that
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
that'll be an addition to that but also
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
what I would say representative leus is
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
that those property poor districts that
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is the
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
base adequacy amount that they be
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
receiving so um it would be in addition
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
to the other money that they're
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
receiving and making sure that the base
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount is to an appropriate
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
amount to be able to fund those schools
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
you representative yes
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
cordel so it's uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so when
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
I look at this my first reaction was
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
like 10,000 such a sort of round number
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
that it almost seemed arbitrary I'm just
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
wondering how you came to that
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
particular figure well as I said in my
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I I'm not that smart so I
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
didn't come up with that figure but um
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
the people who were in the lawsuit for
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
the last few months uh Miss Rizzo
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
Saunders behind me superintendent Rizzo
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
Saunders and the lawyers and the judge
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
in that lawsuit has come up with the
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
number of I think that they had come up
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
with that number it wasn't it wasn't
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
made and that number was based off of
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
the as I said in my testimony the uh
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's including the uh her number
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
$10,000 includes the non-classroom
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
services that are necessary to be able
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
to ensure those students Food Services
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
all those other things that are extra in
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
school that that's how she came up with
 
00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:55.990 align:start position:0%
school that that's how she came up with
that

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
$110,000 uh I think the the itself was
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
75 and that um doesn't include those
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
non-classroom services so $10,000 that
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
round number is a bit of a median
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
between what the uh lawsuit found and
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
what the court had found and uh the 2400
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that the school districts themselves
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
said would be the base adequacy amount
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to fund their schools sort of
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
10,000 is a little bit of a a middle
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
ground between there and also what uh
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent Rizzo Saunders found uh
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
in those in her um analysis of what the
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
school funding would
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
be further questions represent cordelli
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
and then represent kin uh thank you
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler for being here um
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
I was wondering with this um increase um
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
in state adequacy um two and a half
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
times um do you envision um or see the
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of Greater State control of
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
local education than is in place now
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
with quote unquote local
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.829 align:start position:0%
with quote unquote local
control

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
I I I think that would be a different
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
conversation I don't I mean I think that
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
for me this is about the the base
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy that we're funding to our
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
schools you know I think of as a student
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
of conval um and I forgot to mention
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
this in my testimony but as a student of
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
conval who conval is a property Rich
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
District we have a lot of towns we get a
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money um and we're very lucky to
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
have all the opportunities that we have
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
but 10 minutes down the road in a
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring town of Jaffrey uh in the
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
Conan School District they have a
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
property poor District that that has
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
significantly less opportunity so it's
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
not necessarily about um uh
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
restructuring the way that we do
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
education here in New Hampshire it's
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
about making sure that education the way
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we do it is properly
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
funded further represent uh K Gaden
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair lad um and thank you
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
m uh representative wheeler for taking
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
my question so I'm I'm looking for your
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
opinion on this um so we know that the
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
average per pupil expense is between 20
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
and $24,000 per pupil to educate in a
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
public school excluding special
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
education the state constitution says
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
that the state's responsible for paying
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
full adequacy and we often see a number
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
tossed around whether it's four whether
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's three whether it's
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
10 in your opinion why wouldn't we ask
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
for full
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
coverage like it says in the law versus
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
a number
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
does the 10,000 get us to where we need
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
to be for property poor communities do
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
you know just well I think that we need
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
to get to full funding eventually
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden but my opinion
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
on that would be that the 10,000 gets us
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
a significant step forward from where we
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
are and in a in a place where the
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
schools can finally have the leeway to
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
be able to start to address some of
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
those issues that they'd be able to
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
address with full funding and and once
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
we get there then it'll be a lot easier
 
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
to to move forward from there to get to
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
the full number and uh the full number
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be uh a a significant undertaking
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
for the state to take and and I think
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
10,000 based on uh superintendent
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
Saunders number is is the appropriate
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
way to move forward
 
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.269 align:start position:0%
way to move forward
here

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
yes oops so in light of this legislation
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislature do you foresee that this
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
will be an
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing movement I mean it's been going
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
on for years now 20 30
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
years what makes you think that we'll
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
get to full funding well representative
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
cascaden as as long as 20 30 years is
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh also not that long you know and
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
so hopefully um we will you know
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
we I'm very young you know I'm a I'm a b
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a baby here so I I um you know I
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that this fight will continue on I
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
think the movement will will persist and
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
um as long as it takes I know that there
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
are people here in New Hampshire that
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
will make sure that we have uh Fair
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
funding for our
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
schools thank you further
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%

Superior Court to hold a full

trial a trial trial was held this past
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
April and May 2023 where evidence
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
established that there's not a single
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
school in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
where an adequate education can be
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
provided on less than $10,000 per pupil
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
in many districts it cannot be done for
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
14,000 per pupil as a matter of fact the
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
average per pupil expenditure in New
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
$220,000 the districts proved their case
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
of trial using four different
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
methods first I demonstrated using an
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
input analysis the same methodology used
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
by this body in the legislature in
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
2008 that the minimum cost of providing
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
those compon onon which are required by
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
state law exceeds $10,000 per
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
pupil superintendents and business
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
administrators from 17 other districts
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
joined me in making that
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
proof second Dr Bru Baker who was hired
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
by the state and analyzed the cost of
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
providing an education whereby there
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
would be 50% 50%
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.430 align:start position:0%
would be 50% 50%
proficiency

00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
the third for many districts the tuition
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
to other districts and schools
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
agreements by the way that are reviewed
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
and approved by the State Board of
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
Education is the lowest cost and lower
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
than if the district provided a bare
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
minimum based education on their own
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
finally the state's own expert Dr Robert
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
castrell had previously determined the
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
cost of providing a base adequate
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
education which could be adjusted for
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
inflation on November 20th 2023 the
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Court declared the current
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
funding system to be
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional this follows many other
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
decisions that had the same finding
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
up I would ask if you would consider and
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not the committee would vote
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
to extend my
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
time I'm sorry I I make that decision
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have subcommittee
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
going on tomorrow so so we the the prime
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%

your next bill as well um but I do thank
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
you for your time and attention to the
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
fact that we need to fund people um I am
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lauren selig I represent
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
Durham New Hampshire um I'm also the
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
proud parent of two Oyster River
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
students one who is a graduate who has
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
left the state because um education
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities were better for her in
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
another location um and then my uh
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
younger one is a junior at Oyster River
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
High School and um also receive special
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
education services um but the thing that
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
I think we need to remember is that
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
public education is the most critical
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
service that we can provide absolutely
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
the most essential we need to ensure
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
that we fund it fully and properly in
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
order to support all of our future
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
doctors our future lawyers our future
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
state representatives um our future
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
mechanics our future plumbers our future
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
electricians whatever services that you
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
can think of we need to make sure that
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
these people have a fundamental core
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
education um Oyster River and I'm not
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the school system
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
but Oyster River happens to be one of
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
the better funded districts in the state
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
we joined the conval lawsuit because we
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
also felt it was critical to make sure
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
that there's adequate funding across the
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
state um but I can tell you that you
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
know $3,000 $4,000 doesn't cover much of
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
anything in a school system anymore the
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
way the are are extreme and in my
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
district alone I have constituents who
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to me because the property tax
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
that goes to our local school system is
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
about 65% of our cost um and people are
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
not able to get housing because they
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
can't afford the taxes they might be
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
able to pay the mortgage but they can't
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
afford to pay the taxes in order to fund
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
all of these other things and we need to
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
restructure our formula so that there is
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
less of a burden locally and more of a
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
burden across the state thank you very
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions of the
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative not see any thanks okay
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
be back in a little bit uh
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
um I to have so I'm represent Timothy
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
Horan I'm also represent dur Durham
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
along with represent celik and I to have
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to be in three different
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
places at one time I mostly came in for
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
the uh next bill which I am a co-sponsor
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
of and I would have been happy to been a
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of mine and it didn't just
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
and I just didn't end up on the Mast
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
head because you know there's a way
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
things Shuffle around when we do it um
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
so um one thing about uh one thing about
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is um and this is something
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
that probably has might you want to be
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
amended is the effective date is July
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
1st of this year which is pretty soon
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the companion bill about special ed they
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
put that out to uh July 25 so that might
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
obviate some of the Practical concerns
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note which is this cost a
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money and frankly it's
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to uh either
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
involve creating a new tax or increasing
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
an existing tax which is uh certainly a
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
NAA to all of us regardless of which
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
side of the political uh so-called aisle
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
we're on I mean for some of us that's
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much a deal killer for anything
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
but even for those on my side of the
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
aisle that's something we hate to do
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
however this is all going to be offset
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
by uh reducing local property taxes and
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
probably the best mechanism although
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's an issue for the next committee
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
that gets this is a we always have the
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax which is not a
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
great tax but it does exist I mean it
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
does work it's not fair it's cumbersome
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
but it does work
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh and I just want to say
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the past I considered introducing a
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill like this it's I've been around so
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
long I've been in my ter I've been
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
around so long that the current governor
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
was not the governor someone else was a
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
governor when I started and um actually
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
I've served under three governors so I
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
called the budget director who I I she
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
she I guess I can let her make namess
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
she's moved on to other things now but I
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
said like I'm thinking of putting in a
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill that would raise adequacy to a
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
point which is actually approaches
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy and she thought about it for a
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
minute and laughed and said like um we
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't really know what we think about it
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
I mean she liked the idea but it seemed
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
totally impractical but perhaps it is
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
practical so that which is what this
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
bill tries to do do so um it um so I uh
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll do it certainly the
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
question about State control I certainly
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
um I certainly in favor of local control
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
we've passed a lot of bills in the last
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
few years at Road State Control by
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
enforcing the con placing limitations on
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
W can be in the school and I'm against
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
those but I think giving school
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
districts more money gives them more
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
control over uh what they're doing not
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
less so I would
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
U urge the committee I know this is
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
going the subcommittee and U to look at
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
this bill certain you can tweak the
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
amounts you can probably tweak the
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
effective day too so that's up that's I
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
have to say and also I looks like the
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
next bill hearing is not going to start
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
for a while and I have three other plac
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
that be I'll pass around my written
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
testimony for uh the next bill and um if
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
I'm there when pink C just call I'll
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'll speak hopefully more briefly than I
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
did now because I already made a lot of
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to make then so thanks
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much there any questions
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative not seeing thank you
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Sean par I'd like to ask
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
everybody here that we are speaking uh
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
we have a number of bills here we one
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the component within the the
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
formula of special education that's
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
$227,000 we're looking at this on the
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
base cost at 10,000 let's keep this
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
discussion to the topic that's in this
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill so we're not going to be discussing
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
the whole adequacy formula that comes up
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
on another foundational bill which we
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
meter

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
meter
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.269 align:start position:0%
meter
yeah

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%

clarification chairman lad you just
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
asked for the remarks to be made only to
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 1583 I wrote my remarks just in the
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
interest of time to uh address three
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
different bills that are being heard
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
today would you like me to reserve those
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the time when they're being heard
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
later on in the afternoon well you you
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
you have to have a pink card on all
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
those bills if you haven't done that
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
then you need to speak to this bill um
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
you also have just three minutes to do
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
that all within if you'd like to give
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
some comments regarding all within your
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
three minute period go for it happy to
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
do that thank you you're welcome as you
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
are well aware judge Rua's recent ruling
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
in the conval lawsuit states that while
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
it is ultimately up to you as
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
legislators to determine the cost of
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
Base adequacy it quote can be no less
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
than $
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
7,356 And1 per pupil per year and the
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
true cost is likely much higher than
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
that end quote hb1 1583 is proposed
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 base adequacy Aid moves the
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
needle closer toward fulfilling your
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to fund an adequate
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
public education every New Hampshire
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
District without exception spends
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
significantly more than $10,000 per
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
student the state averages actually
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
double that at over
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
$20,000 in Dover we have the ninth
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
lowest per pupil expenditures in the
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
state and our homeowners still struggle
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
to absorb their ever increasing tax
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
bills the do school board urges you to
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
move forward with this increase in
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid regarding hb1
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
1656 a 13-fold increase in special
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
education differentiated Aid might seem
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
extreme but it is substantiated by New
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's actual costs in the 2021 22
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
Academic Year schools spent an average
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
28,36 in additional funds per special
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
education student $227,000 in
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid is a high number but
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
it is the real number based on our
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
state's own data and historical spending
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
in do like in many other districts we
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
struggle annually to absorb the
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
disproportionately increasing special
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
education costs into our limited budgets
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic Aid money our district
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
May partially recoup a year from now
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
does not improve our Grim Financial
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
reality as we budget for the upcoming
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
year which we are doing right now
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
current levels of special education
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
funding at just $2,100 per student are
 
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.110 align:start position:0%
funding at just $2,100 per student are
wildly

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
wildly
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
insufficient finally HB 1686 States what
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
judge Ruf ruled in November in the Rand
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuit retention of excess swept and
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
Associated negative tax rates is
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and must end so much
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
about school funding is complicated and
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
nuanced I submit today that in the case
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
of access swept the decision is
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
decidedly simple the do school board
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
urges you to move this bill forward as
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
proposed so our state can comply with
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
the outcome of this lawsuit and move
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
toward Equitable and adequate funding of
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire Public Schools thank
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%

um could could you tell us a little bit
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
about how the um the tax cap and over
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
affects um uh School budgets yeah
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we've had our tax cap in
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
place for longer than I've been on the
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
school board um I think about 10 or 12
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
years or so um I can give some examples
 
00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:17.789 align:start position:0%
years or so um I can give some examples
uh

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
in in this budget season right now we
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
were um our tax cap allowable amount
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
which compared to other years was quite
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
generous because we have had a an
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
economic boom uh our tax cap is based on
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
the consumer price index average of the
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
past three years so we had a pretty
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
significant increase it amounted to
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
about um 3,000 or $3,200,000 I believe
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
for this year to to put that into
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
perspective our school budget is about
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
$85 is million doll give or take um
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
depending on what you count in that
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
group the um the tax cap is a burden
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
every single year um it was only not a
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
burden the first year of covid because
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
we had to significantly cut back on very
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
expensive things like transportation for
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
the year so we were able to come in
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
under the tax cap at that point it is a
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
an annual struggle every single year
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
last year we did manage to um to come in
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
under the tax cap but it came at a
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
significant price to our district um the
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
year before that we had a $3.6 million
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
override and again that's within the
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
context of an $85 million School budget
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
so it was a pretty significant override
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
um that was to to keep the lights on so
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
to speak uh we're you know we're not
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
installing Olympic siiz swimming pools
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
and sending our our students to Italy um
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
that was basic operational costs this
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
year to um to keep our budget within the
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
tax cap we would have to cut 27 teaching
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
positions as a reference and to be clear
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
that is not on the table currently um as
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
we say so so often in our school board
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
meetings um it is not on the table to
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
cut 27 teaching positions that's the
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
equivalent of one entire grade which of
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
course will never happen but we
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
encountered about $2.2 million in excess
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
special education costs within the past
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
three or four months only due to new
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
students coming into the district
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
students having um uh IEPs that didn't
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
exist before or needing to be sent out
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
of District um and and transportation
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
for special Aid was a huge factor in
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
that so as I said before we had about
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
$3.2 million in increase that would be
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
within our tax cap um $2.2 million of
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
that uh was automatically used up by our
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
federally mandated rights for our
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
special education students to provide
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
them an adequate education um
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
additionally we had about $2.5 million
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
in reduction from State um state income
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it has it has been dire to to put it
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
mildly um it is difficult it is very
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to balance the needs of our
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers with the needs of our students
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
and what is uh federally required of us
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
to provide an adequate education to our
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
special education students it is never
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
easy and and every year it never gets
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
easier we are significantly hampered by
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
our tax
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
cap thank you for your question thank
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
record here no no right at the end right
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%

100 uh
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
Sydney you know I really know why we
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
passed legislation last year dealing
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
with cursive
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.750 align:start position:0%
with cursive
writing

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I've see that on a lot of
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
cards so
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you for um hearing me this
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
morning I'm actually kind of happy about
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
the timing of me being called up right
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
after do because I'm here to speak
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully on behalf of small rural
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire so that I can
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
offer you a little bit of a different
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh the effect that uh
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy especially this base adequacy
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
number has on some small rural districts
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
currently so I am the superintendent of
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
the planfield and Cornish school
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
districts they are two school districts
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
but like many other staff they uh share
 
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.670 align:start position:0%
but like many other staff they uh share
a

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent I'm asking this committee
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
to consider this $10,000 change and to
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
fulfill a step towards fulfilling the
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
Constitutional obligation uh to fund an
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all of New
 
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all of New
Hampshire

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
students as we are going into budget
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
season uh we have our budgets in draft
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
form at this point getting ready for our
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings as I'm sure most
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
districts do and I wanted to give you
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
some actual numbers of what the tax
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
burden is on local taxpayers so for
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
example if you are looking at the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
Cornish School District the budget
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
increase of approximately
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
4.8% which in this day and age of
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
inflation is looking pretty good and
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable will transl into an
 
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
reasonable will transl into an
approximate

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
approximate
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
88.9% increase on local tax dollars if
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the plane field draft
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
budget at this point a
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
1.75% increase which is what we are
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
proposing will translate into an
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
11.7% increase on local taxpayers what's
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
happening because of property values
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
because of this formula in small rural
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
districts is an extreme burden burden on
 
00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.829 align:start position:0%
districts is an extreme burden burden on
local

00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we are looking at basic needs
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
no budget has anything frivolous or
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
fancy in it at this point we are trying
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
to do what we can for academic
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
achievement and learning
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
recovery on top of those issues oh I I
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
should also mention the 1.75% increase
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
does not include any collective
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements that is just
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
operating expenses that will translate
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
into an 11.7%
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
increase um in addition to academic
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
achievement we're also looking at
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
learning recovery over the last couple
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
of years which takes additional
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of building uh needs
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
one of the communities is also looking
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
at issues with pasas a major roof repair
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
not even maybe repair reconstruction
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
HVAC issues and asbestos only three out
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
of 17 building a projects were funded so
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
we believe that this is also a burden
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
that will fall on local
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers both of these districts work
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
diligently to share wherever they can to
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
reduce these burdens on local taxpayers
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
we share staff uh we have one school
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
that makes lunch in the kitchen and
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
drives it to the other District to the
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
other school to deliver it uh we're
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
thinking of ways we can even share a
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
tractor we share staff we are also
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
considering ways that we can share
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
students and all of those things are
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
good conversations to have however this
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
is all um part of the effort an
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary effort that goes into
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
funding what we believe can be an
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
adequate education for our
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
students I want to end for the small
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
rural District by saying um in small
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
ponds ripples are
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
bigger so when you're looking at this
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount um when you're looking
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the effect it could have on a do I
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
also want you to consider the effect
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
that it has on these small districts
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
where these tax increases for local
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are huge one final comment is
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
given the formula um for the Cornish
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
district for example uh with the
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
reduction or elimination of
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization Aid um after next year if
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
the formula continues the Cornish school
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
district will see an $80,000 decrease in
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy every year if student
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
population stays the same because of the
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
reduction in hold harness thank you very
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
much time are there any questions are
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
laus I'm totally not understanding your
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
math so if you can explain to me please
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
um how a small increase in your what
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost leads to such a large
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
percentage increase leads to such a
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
large percentage increase in the tax
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
rate because of revenues because when
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
you have expenses on one side if you
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't have revenues that match if your
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
revenues are lower your expense increase
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
percentage goes up okay thank you sure
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you again thank you for
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
par welcome good morning thank you for
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony my name is Sean par
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm on the Manchester School Board
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
where I chair the education legislation
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
committee today I'm speaking on behalf
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester School Board which has
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
authorized me to advocate for fully
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
funding education in New Hampshire we
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
urge you to approve HB
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
1583 and uh as you know Manchester is
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
one of the plaintiffs on the conval
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and so we I will summarize this
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh we also agree that uh with the trial
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
it's time to change the way we do
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
adequate education in New Hampshire uh
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
we would like to know how you the state
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
legislature plan to act on this ruling
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
to give some perspective on the gravity
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
of the need for increased funding I
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand how
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
underfunded the city of Manchester has
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
been using data from the New Hampshire
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed which appears to be
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit behind what I heard
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
for the average amount there the cost
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
per pupil the average cost if we say is
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
around $20,000 per student uh Manchester
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire's most populace most
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
diverse and most impoverished student
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
body we're at the very bottom of how
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
much we spend per student at $155,000
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
per student uh with over 12,000 students
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
we would need more than $50 million per
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
year in order to raise our spending up
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the average New Hampshire level this
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
is the definition of chronic
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
underfunding we are grateful for the
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
Boost of funding granted during the last
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it will do wonders for our
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
students but it doesn't get the state to
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be to have a fully
 
00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:51.589 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be to have a fully
funded

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
system with this first step that the
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
state took in the last budget cycle and
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
the the conal ruling which has
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
substantiated the dire need to increase
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
Aid and change the adequacy formula it's
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
time to take those next steps revise the
 
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
formula and fully fund New Hampshire
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
schools we need to increase funding
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
particularly to those districts with the
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
greatest need that's another reason why
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here to reiterate the fact that
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester is such a district with over
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
50% of our students qualifying for free
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch uh and with around 25%
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
of our students qualifying for special
 
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
of our students qualifying for special
education

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
services that's why we also support the
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
next two bills on your docket HB 1656
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
which increases aid for students
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services and
 
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.069 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services and
HB

00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
1586 which uh re-envisions how we fund
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
education in this state to become a
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
system of public school funding that
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
allocates funding from the state sources
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
to those communities with the greatest
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
need and lowest capacities in order to
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state provides all
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
children with an opportunity for a
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live fly
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
funding education in New Hampshire is
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
desperately needed thank you for your
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you any questions
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
from Manchester yes represent luno thank
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
you very much um uh chair par for for
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
being with us this morning could you
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about some of the
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
challenges that are unique that that
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
that you face uniquely in
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester sure uh I mean I'm not sure
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
where to start but I think uh generally
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
speaking you know I heard from the other
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
school board representative some of
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
those same issues are also apply to
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester particularly the special
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
education services which have
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed in past years uh but also
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation which has really
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
increased in cost over the last several
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
years there you know we you know I think
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
we are in dire need there but you know
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're not without hope in Manchester we
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
have a good superintendent we're very uh
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
hopeful that uh we will be able to start
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
turning some things around we have an
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
outline of a plan for long-term
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
facilities updates we have an outline uh
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
we have uh gone through a very
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
successful negotiation with our unions
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
there so we have some reason to believe
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
that there's some hope for getting at
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
for improvement in Manchester that said
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know every year we are still kind of
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
tying things together so to speak to
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that we provide the best
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
education we can for our students there
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh what we've been
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to find ways to advocate
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
for our eles right here at the state
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
level there but also to find ways to
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
make do with less and I think that that
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
making do with less has been our Mana
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
for quite some time for quite some time
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further yes go ahead so thank
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair and thank you thank
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
you for uh for taking the follow-up
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
question could um could could you also
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
um uh uh
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
indicate how many students are in the
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District compared
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
compared to across our um great state of
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um um yeah ju just
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
really that sure so we have 12,300
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
students in our district uh by the last
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
count that I saw there um so that you
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
know it's 21 schools uh it's a very
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
large system we have uh uh we're really
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
one of the largest employers in the
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
state in that way it's a very large
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
system and so uh one of the things we've
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
been trying to do is to make that system
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
a better system and when you investigate
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
systems as large as Manchester you see
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
so many areas where the supports have
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
been kind of glued together to make ends
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
meet and so we are seeing more and more
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
how in order to make our systems right
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
and fair and Equitable for our students
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
we need to change how the system works
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a certain way and a lot of that has
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
to do with funding uh but it also has to
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
do with organization and we've done a
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
lot already with the way we've organized
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
our district there and I think you know
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
if we're talking 12,300 students there
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's a good proportion
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
there of of of of resources there and I
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know I I have been to all 21 schools
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
I have seen the state of our buildings I
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
have seen uh how much our teachers have
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
to do for our students there how we have
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
to how we have to really work hard to
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
reduce class sizes in places where
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
there's a squeeze and I think you know
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel can only do so much right we
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
have great person but you know they've
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
been working really hard and at the at
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
their end for quite some time there so I
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
think that this type of increase in
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
funding is really urgently needed in
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
order to support our students our
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
teachers and and the people of New
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it has a far-reaching
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
effect for the future thank you thank
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
you very much uh further questions from
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you thank you for
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
gy

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you I drove through your
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
town today no doubt you uh saw the
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
rocket the missile yes I did right there
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
in Warren uh my name is Michael gy I'm
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
in my fifth year as principal of a
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
Warren Village School a small rural
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
remote prek through 8 institution uh W
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
wvs is a school with proud wooden bones
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
that date back to the
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
1850s what struck me in judge Rua's 56
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
page ruling that found the state's
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid unconstitutional is the use
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
of the word conservative does anyone
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
here know how many times the judge used
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
the word conservative in his decision
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
document 45 times he used it not only
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
when setting his own mind monetary
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
calculus to the cost drivers of
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
education but to the numbers the
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs used in making their case in
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
other words he reasoned that the
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's use of conservative numbers
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
when reaching a constitutional adequacy
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
Aid of
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
$99,900 was fair yet he decided to one
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
up them and ruled for an adequacy aid
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
$2,543 199
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
less he doesn't leave us guessing
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
he did that quote because he said he
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
undervalued the requisite level of
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
funding and deference to the legislature
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
I think he was talking about you I think
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
like me he reasoned that among one of
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
the world's largest legislative bodies
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
there would have to be great minds that
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
will figure this out and will do the
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
just and honorable thing for our
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
proy let me share another concern
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
conservative education number with you
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
37.5 that is the contract hours per week
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
that my district demands from our
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
teachers that is the calculus used for
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
their salary my district is a school
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
that has a student population identified
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
by the doe as having a higher
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged rate than
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
93% of all other schools in New
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are educating students with
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
no running water and I know you get it I
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
know I don't need to fold in the numbers
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
of students who are being raised by
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
single parent households or
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
grandparents or the number of students
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
who have not just experienced trauma but
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
are living in dramaa believe it or not I
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
can tell you how many students my
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
teachers are feeding out of their own
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
Pockets I can tell you how many pairs of
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
shoes my teacher have bought their
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
students so far this year and how many
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
coats we issue every recess and let it
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
be known that these noble men and women
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
labor at a lower average salary than
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
80% of all other teachers in New
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know what these stats howl
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
failure and yet in the newly released
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
data by the doe Warren Village School
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
has a higher score in math than
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
88% of all other schools in the state
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
our combined math and Ela scores placed
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
us at a ranking of 124th out of 453
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
schools do you think that our teachers
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
are doing that at a conservative 37
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
hours your time is expired so wrap it up
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
please I will wrap it
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
up um the days when great principles
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
like Ray Burton one of my esteemed
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
predecessors at Warren Village School
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
Could Walk The Halls slapping a wooden
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
paddle and making all right with the
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
world are gone raised kids are not my
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
kids we need help help I think deep down

respectfully deferred to you and bless
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
you all any questions yes represent luno
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um uh principal gy
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
for uh for joining us this morning
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure um I was wondering if you could
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
um um well you know just prior to you we
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
had chairman par from Manchester say how
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
12,300 students in the Manchester School
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
District how many how many kiddos do you
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
have in the Warren well we started out
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
with 70 this year and we're down to 64
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
we have probably about five families or
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
five students each year it's a
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
transitory population it jumps it it it
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
declines uh we're projecting 60 at this
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
point for next year um but then it it it
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
changes but a very low number uh most of
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
our classes are combined for that very
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
reason okay a quick follow up Mr chair
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
so would it would would you agree then
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
that um or would it be fair to say that
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's school funding
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
formula isn't working for both large
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
districts like Manchester or small
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
districts like
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
Warren I can't speak to the larger
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
districts I know that our average per
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
pupil rate is
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
$26,000 I know that up the street rumney
 
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
$26,000 I know that up the street rumney
is

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
$37,000 I know that the larger schools
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
it may be 20,000 I can say the speaker
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
earlier that said in small rural
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
districts the ripple effect is more
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
profound I can absolutely testify to
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
that uh we're struggling and as you know
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
it's hard to recruit young teachers
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to work 60 hours a
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%

state we are urging your support of the

proposed bills that would increase

funding and support for schools in our

state in Pittsfield a small property
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
poor town just half an hour from our

Capital students have lived through the
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
inadequate funding formula every day we
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
have had our schools budget SL some
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
years resulting in losing valuable
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
courses that provoke thought and prepare
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
us for the real world we don't have the
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
money in our school budget for foreign
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
language teachers which most colleges
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
and universities require two years of

just to submit an admissions
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
application we don't have a music
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
teacher as our district cannot compete
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
with larger school districts who can
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
offer candidates much higher pay we need
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
more support staff to assist our special
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
education students who require support
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
to help ensure their academic and
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
personal growth we have so many needs
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
yet so little money to meet those needs
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers have to draw a line
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere and cost of living has already
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
increased so much over the years forcing
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
the hand of Pittsfield residents to vote
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
down important measures for our school
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
for too long the state has not fulfilled
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
its promises made in the initial
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont lawsuit before we were even
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
born it is time to make right on the
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
promises made to our future generations
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education our education
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
should not be defined by the zip code in
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
which we live as students we are held to
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
basic expectations such as completing
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
assignments on time yet the promises
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
once made by our Supreme Court have
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
missed its deadline by over 20 years we
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
now have the opportunity to correct this
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
mistake and provide a more adequate and
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
equ a education to all of our students
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
that will help our schools and future

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
little bit differently um my name is
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas Opel I am here representing
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
myself uh but I'm uh I'm from Kanan the
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um also a small rural Town not
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
quite as small as Warren or planfield or
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
carnish but uh but small enough um I
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
chair our Economic Development Committee
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
um because we're trying to relieve some
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the burden on our on our homeowners
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
on our property taxpayers in our
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
community and they are struggling about
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
a third of the families in canyan live
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
below the poverty line so we have a very
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
diverse population but we have some
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
families that are having a very very
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
hard time and I I kind of want to make
 
00:58:56.079 --> 00:58:57.109 align:start position:0%
hard time and I I kind of want to make
two

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
points the first point is that our
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
public schools from the founding of this
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
nation it's not just in our constitution
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
but just about every single one of the
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
founders of this nation talked about the
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
importance of public education public
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
education as a unifier as a place where
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
we T teach people how to be citizens in
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
a democracy in a republic um a fact
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
recognized by this legislature when you
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
passed legislation requiring better
 
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.950 align:start position:0%
passed legislation requiring better
Civics

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
Civics
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
education um and public schools are also
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
a place where we bring people together
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
in ways that don't happen as much
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
anymore in this country um it is the
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
great unifier in many ways people come
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
together and experience themselves um
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
and meet people of of different
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
backgrounds different economic
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
backgrounds so they're critically
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
important to our democracy and working
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
together they're also important from an
 
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.309 align:start position:0%
together they're also important from an
economic

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh the fact of the matter is
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
they're creating the workforce of the
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
future and in New Hampshire when we talk
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire Advantage we've
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
kind of gained the system the fact of
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
the matter is we're the second oldest we
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
have the second oldest population in the
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
country and uh 60% of our population was
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
not born here I I'm one of those people
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I as the saying goes I wasn't born in
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I got here as soon as
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
I could um I uh my first job out of
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
college was teaching at a public school
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
in Hudson New Hampshire um I think about
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
15 years before the first Claremont
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
decision the first Claremont decision
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
think about that 1976 when I started
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
teaching 1993 was the first Claremont
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
decision that told us what we were doing
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
the way we were funding Public Schools
 
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
the way we were funding Public Schools
was

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um I will say as
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
someone who has three children who have
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
now all finished high school although
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
one is still a UNH um the the the fact
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
of the matter is we we have been doing
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
this a long long time we've recognized
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
the problem courts have recognized the
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
problem it is hurting us uh we can't
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
continue to have an elderly population
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
just getting more and more elderly as
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
our young folks leave the state for
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
better opportunities um in Canan we
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
spend uh about uh $23,000 per pupil and
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
as any business person knows scale is
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
critically important there are certain
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentals that you have to pay for
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
whether you have 10 students or 12,000
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
students um you know buildings cost
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
money to build to equip to heat to
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
maintain um and those are fixed costs
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you know um as I say the the
 
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
that you know um as I say the the
student

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
population impacts it to some degree but
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
at at some base level you're going to
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
have to pay for that and that has an
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
impact both on your
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
community the other thing that public
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
schools represent in many ways are
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
Community Pride whether it's academics
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
or Athletics um you know these are these
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
are sources of Community Pride and
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
they're critically important to our
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
Economic Development and our democracy
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
um and if I can just make one last Quick
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
point one of the things that is
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
happening in Kanan and I know it's
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
happening in a lot of other communities
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
particularly those like Kanan that are
 
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
struggling you're creating a situation
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
in which property taxpayers who are
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
already struggling are beginning to
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
resent the money they spend on public
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
education because those tax rates
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
typically are the biggest rate on their
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
on their tax bills that's a dangerous
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
path to go down to start having people
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
resent public
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
education um I and I hope this committee
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
takes this first step um
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 is a good first step
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
but it's not enough thank you very much
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee wait until those grandkids
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
come along you're gonna have to pay for
 
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.230 align:start position:0%
come along you're gonna have to pay for
them

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
too as long as they're still in the
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
turny good morning good morning thank
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad thank you members of
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
the committee um I'm speaking here in
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I'd actually
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
like to address some questions that were
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
asked of the uh SP or earlier um we're
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
here to talk about base adequacy base
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy is the cost to educate a child
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
okay that does not qualify for any of
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the differential AIDS because of that
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
particular child's learning needs in
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
other words base adequacy is the least
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
expensive hypothetical minimum for the
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
least expensive to educate child
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that all other state funding
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
sources whether that be for special
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
education or whether that be for uh
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
building Aid are fully funded okay that
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of base adequacy is what Dr
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
Rizzo Saunders determined in
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
2019 okay cost
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
9,929 per pupil that's what Dr Baker
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
determined in 2020 as part of the
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
legislative study commission Dr Baker's
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
analysis was paid for by the Legislative
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
study commission and he determined that
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
$996 in 2020 here we are in 2023 talking
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
about the costs of
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
2024 um and those costs have gone up
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
there's something called inflation um
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know if I was representative wheeler
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have set that number at
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
10,000 it would have been higher than
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
10,000 um but there is a cost there is a
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
real cost I ask each and every one of
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
you to think about what that real cost
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
is think about it in your communities
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
think about it Statewide okay there's
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
also something that has been alluded to
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
um which is districts with transitory um
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
student populations have additional
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
costs okay judge Rua's decision was
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
presuming the most conservative number
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
in a perfect real world in which every
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
single classroom had exactly 30 students
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's not really possible okay because
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
you can't say we are the whatever school
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
district and once we reach 30 students
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow any more first
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
graders in we're not going to allow any
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
more second graders in we've reached our
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
30 students no once another student
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
comes in the school district needs to
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
educate that child they need to hire a
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
teacher maybe Midway through the year
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is really really difficult and
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
really really expensive which is why um
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
you you don't have perfect efficiency in
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
any school district in the state so if
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's any questions for me I'd be
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but I want
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
the uh committee to think about that
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
this $10,000 bill is presuming that all
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the differential Aid is fully funded
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
it is not including any building Aid or
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
any other state uh funding sources or
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
any federal funding sources this is
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
determining the lowest possible
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
cost thank you very much and representa
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
for being here could you indicate where
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
you are from yes and also the second
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
question is since you since you
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
obviously are aware of the case uh can
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
you under can you Enlighten the
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee on what the state said their
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
defense was for their
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
$4,100 and what what the basis of their
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
findings were as far as how that $4,100
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
came about yes thank you representative
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
Myer um I live in the town of hopkington
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
um I also served as lead councel in the
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
conal case um the state did not have a
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
defense that the $4,100 is actually the
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
true cost of providing an adequate
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
education the state only attacked the
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's arguments um arguments which
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
the court found to be fully credible but
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
the $4,100 does not have any um relation
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
to what the true cost of providing an
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
adequate education is to the least cost
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
to educate child followup please yes so
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
Mr attorney what you're saying is that
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state then had no basis for how they
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
came up with the $4,100 is that correct
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
correct in fact um the state had no
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
basis thank you further questions from
 
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
basis thank you further questions from
the

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%

funding lawsuit besides conal that's
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
currently happening um but I'm
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of myself I do
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
support the increase to base adequacy
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
but House Bill 1583 Falls fall far short
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the actual cost so as you've heard
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the court in conal issued an order on
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
November 20th setting a baseline of
 
01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:43.709 align:start position:0%
November 20th setting a baseline of
about

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
$7,300 as the minimum threshold for what
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state should fund base adequacy
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
importantly that was the only issue
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
before the court in conal base adequacy
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
not looking at any differentiated Aid as
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Tierney just explained but also um
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
there's a different approach in conval
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
of how they proved their case about
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy our case Rand is still ongoing
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
and we challenge both base adequacy and
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and even within base
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
adequate adequacy itself we have a
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
broader approach to tackling how much it
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually cost and we assert that the
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
actual cost of AD adequacy should be
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
close to the average spending in the
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
state and based on the doe data and this
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
is based on the um adma as of 12 22 23
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
so very recent the average cost per
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
people for 2022 2023 was over
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and when you add in other
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures like Transportation
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
construction and interest the average is
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually over
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
$24,000 so even with differentiated Aid
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
included and other funding um setting
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
base adequacy at 10,000 as this bill
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
does will not reach the level of actual
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
spending and the actual cost of
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate education that the state is
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionally obligated to provide
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
Trumble thank you Mr chairman David
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony is there place I
 
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
written testimony is there place I
should

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning committee members my
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
name is David Trumble from the town
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
aware there's been a lot of testimony so
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
I will not try to repeat things but I do
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to go over a few points first I
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
think it's important to go back to the
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
original Claremont decision that
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
decision had four major Holdings first
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's the state's duty to provide an
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
education all the children in New
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the town's Duty second is
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
that the level of Education must be
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate third is the
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
state must guarantee adequate funding
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
and fourth is that this Duty applies to
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
the public schools that word is taken
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
directly from the Constitution this does
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
not apply to private schools as for the
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
ruof decision I hope that every member
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
of this committee has read that decision
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
I've gone through it a couple times
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
myself if you have not before you vote
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
on any of these bills I urge you to read
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
it through from cover to cover that
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
judge does conservatively pick the
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
$7,300 number but he says 9900 is more
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
likely to be the base number that's
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
constitutionally minimum he also says
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's an inputs based analysis he looks
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
at Dr Baker's analysis who was
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
originally hired by you and he came up
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
with about the same figure using an
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
output space analysis but judge R said
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to consider that because
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
this case is based on how to what's the
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
inputs but it's interesting as a
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
benchmark he said that either system you
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
come up with that's the bare minimum
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
number this decision has fundamental
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
importance to our state because 85% of
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
our children go through the public
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
schools that means 85% of the people who
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
vote for you in elections go went to a
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
public school 85% of the people who work
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
in this state or moms and dads in the
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
state go through Public Schools this is
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
essential not only to them as
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
individuals but to our economy as was
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously it's also essential
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
to our informed citizenry in the very
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
functioning of our democracy the problem
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
with funding in the state is specific
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
particularly hard for places that don't
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
have enough property tax base to
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
adequately fund their own schools the
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
state contribution is grossly inadequate
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
small towns big towns that have lots of
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
low-income students places without
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
without a strong property tax base those
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
communities cannot adequately fund their
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
education we're talking tens and tens
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
and tens of thousands of children and
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
their schools every day have to choose
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
between fixing the roof or having a
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
reading instructor or having classrooms
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
that have 30 or 35 children in the
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
classroom if any of you have been
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
Educators and I imagine a lot of you
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
have been being on this committee you
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
know how hard that would be the choices
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
that are being made in the state every
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
day are being put on the backs of our
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
children this is your obligation it's
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
been your obligation for almost four
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
decades it's time that the legislature
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
live up to its obligation and stop
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
looking at school funding as an expense
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
but looking at it as an investment in
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
our future if you consider it an
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
investment you will be proud to at least
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
put $10,000 per per child thank you for
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very much David are
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
there any questions yes represent
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr Shar and
 
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Trumble for uh
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
for being here uh this morning and for
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it's it's somewhat
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
of a technical question um and and I
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
hope you can you can you know help uh
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
help us with this but you introduced the
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
idea of an input-based analysis compared
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
to an outcomes based analysis such as
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
what Dr Baker um did and while the while
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
the the base numbers for that came out
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty close I was wondering what
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
if you can talk to us about what the
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
difference is between an input-based
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
costing analysis and an outcomes based
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
costing analysis so input based would be
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
what does it cost us to provide the
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
buildings the classrooms the the uh the
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
number of teachers based on the class
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
size so it's just based on what do we
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to do in order to physically run a
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
school and that's at least 10,000 at a
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
bare minimum we know it's more than that
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
an output space system just says let's
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
forget about what the what the inputs
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
are what's our goal we want to have an
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
educated citizenry what does it cost us
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
to do that and then you work backwards
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
and I know that you're uh Bill coming up
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
a couple down the road here the work of
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
the commission the 2020 commission that
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
you and chairman lad were on used an
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
outputs based formula and you said what
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
do we need in order to adequately fund
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
our schools if we look for the results
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
rather than the inputs and that number
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
Dr Baker says is about the same so
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
basically either way at a bare minimum
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
you need
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
$110,000 so I I won't get into
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
testifying on the third bill I'll I'll
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that one later but I think
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's just basically it's interesting
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
that either way you look at it you come
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
to about the same
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
amount I I I I want to be cautious how
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
far we dig down now we're going to be
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of this tomorrow you and I
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
have gone through tputs inputs versus
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
output performance and all that Doe 25
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
forms and all that um and I think
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
David's right in giving that brief
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
definition and I think that's where we
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
all stop it for this yes thank you um
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
chairman you're welcome Karen Hill is
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman you're welcome
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
Karen Leo Hill I am a 19-year city
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
councelor in the city of Lebanon the
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
former mayor I'm also the Grafton County
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer but today I'm here as an
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
individual because our city council um
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
has not had a chance to review this
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislation in
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
particular it is frustrating that 30
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
years after the first Claremont lawsuit
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
we are still here without a resolution
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
we've known for a long time that the
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
state's allotment currently around
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
$4,000 is insufficient to fully fund an
 
01:16:46.719 --> 01:16:47.950 align:start position:0%
$4,000 is insufficient to fully fund an
adequate

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
education and we've also known that the
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
disparities that result from Big
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
differences in fund available at the
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
local level have also persisted for
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
these past 30
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
years and there was more than sufficient
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
evidence to Prevail in the conval
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit as has been discussed
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
$110,000 is a conservative figure for
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
the true cost of an adequate
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
education New Hampshire children deserve
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
the chance to succeed and to live up to
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
their full
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
potential the child zip code should not
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
determine their educational
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities funding education is also
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
an economic issue and I do want to
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
underscore the testimony of Thomas Opel
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
which I found very compelling from the
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
economic development perspective it is
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
past time for the legislature to address
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
education funding in New Hampshire I
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to send this to to do
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
the work uh that you have discussed and
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
to ultimately send this to the floor
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation of a to pass thank
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee have a good drive back to
 
01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.709 align:start position:0%
committee have a good drive back to
Lebanon

01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
Heber okay you're
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
Coral this one is good morning Kor I
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
live just six miles up the road in
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
Penacook um I was a public School
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
educator for 14 years and my stud my
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
children went through Public Schools as
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
did I in New Hampshire um I want to
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the Forward Thinking
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
about the interconnectedness of policy
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
structure and finance because this isn't
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
you can't just throw money um at a
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem I think our public schools are
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
amazing and I support them that's the
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
hill all die on and they aren't perfect
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
and our structures aren't perfect and I
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I think we definitely need to
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
consider the interconnectedness of all
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
of those things um I hope that you will
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
um think about uh including students in
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
the conversations that you'll be having
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittees um including places
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
like um pitsfield but also I encourage
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
you to think about other places like
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
Franklin um which does have a tax cap um
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
and also funds their education
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
interestingly compared to the rest of
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
the state um I wanted to just reiterate
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
um that I hope that this is the year um
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
that we finally get this done and that
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislators uphold their Oaths to the
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
constit tion and at the very least
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
provide a significant increase to the
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
state's contribution to public education
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
especially for our poorest districts
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
which not incidentally have the highest
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
rates of 504s and
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
IEPs I've personally never liked that we
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
use the word adequate to describe
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
education it's too subjective it's
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
uninspired um and because we failed to
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
Define it in a way that accounts for our
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
changing economy and technological
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
advancements it's been quite easy for
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
leaders to lowball the actual cost and
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
contribution reminder when uh Claremont
 
01:19:54.629 --> 01:19:54.639 align:start position:0%
happened we didn't have all this
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
technology and so that is an extra
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
burden an extra cost that we've had over
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
the course of the years that I don't
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
think we've accounted for in our funding
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I would like to consider a quality
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
education where each child regardless of
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
zip code and socioeconomic status of
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
their parents and Community has the same
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
access to Dynamic and rigorous learning
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
experiences as their peers the next town
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
over Universal quality might be too much
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ask for so I'll ask for adequacy in
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the words of coach belich do your job
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
ensure our public schools have the money
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
to provide the best education for each
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
student education that affects the
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
quality of life for all of us thank you
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%

morning Zach
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
M all right well I'll jump in while

so I'm Zack Shen I'm here representing
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school funding
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
fairness project uh for those of you who
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't know us we are a nonprofit
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
organization that does education around
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
school funding and property taxes in the
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
state um tries to engage um citizens
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
school board members students and really
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
try to Advocate um for both our students
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers for a fairer system um I
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
will do my best to not repeat uh things
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
that have been said previously in the in
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
the interest of time do want to
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
highlight a number of things and I can
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
pass on my uh testimony after
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to reiterate something that's
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
been brought up a few times I want to
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
kind of really drive home this point the
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
current amount of school funding that
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
the state contributes to schools
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
including differential Aid which is a
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
little outside the scope of the current
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill is still only a little over $5,000
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
per student compare that to the average
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures of $220,000 depending on
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
what you include is a huge mismatch
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
between how much the state is supplying
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
to schools and how much is born on the
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
backs of local property taxpayers
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh some the rate current uh rates range
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
property tax rates um from a121 in
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
millsfield to $15 79 cents in Hinsdale
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
those are just for districts actually
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
have students it's much lower for some
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
places that don't have students
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
themselves um and the Crux of this is a
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
continual downshifting of this
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fund our public
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
education to local property taxpayers
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's about $2 billion a year that we are
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
currently raising from local local
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes to pay for our Public
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
Schools we pay for 70% of all of our
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
Public Schools all the revenue for them
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
from local property tax paays uh
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
multiple people have quoted the Supreme
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh Superior Court rulings from Judge
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
ruof about how the base accuracy number
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
he arrived at the 7300 is a very
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
conservative number um but just to kind
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
of put that in reference and answer our
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
question from earlier that is not
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
advocating for an increase in overall
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
public education funding this current
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill and the ruling from the conval
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit could represent a shifting in
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility from local property
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to where it belongs to at the
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
state just to give you a ballpark figure
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go into effect and
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
school districts were to pass those
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
savings directly on to local property
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to keep the same amount of
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
money we're currently spending we
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
decrease the burden from about 70% to
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
only 45% funded by local property
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for public school
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
systems I also want to address this kind
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
of back and forth the courts legislature
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
can't have it both ways you can't ignore
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
Court ruling standing Supreme Court
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
precedent for years and then the fact
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
that we happen to have some ongoing
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
lawsuits right now want to just wait and
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
see where they lead before taking action
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
addressing that specific concern one of
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
the things has not been brought up that
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
came out of the conv Val ruling from the
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
from the court quote it is likewise
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
cognizant that school funding is a
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
complicated and politically charged
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
issue with a history that suggests some
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
level of judicial intervention is now
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
necessary among other things though the
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislature hired expert witness to
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
analyze school funding issues and
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
provide an informed recommendation base
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
Advocate is currently funded at less
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
than half of his recommended level this
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
is just one example that calls into
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
question whether the politics of this
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
issue are impeding the state's
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to fully fund
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for children in the
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
state to receive an adequate education
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
that ends today was that my time all
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
right I'll jump to the end so thank you
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you uh taking the time to
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
listen to My Testimony I just want to
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
highlight that what is missing is not a
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
lack of data of information of judicial
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
rulings you have the vehicles before you
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
to move forward on this there are a
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
number of bills be hearing from later
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll also hand out my testimony
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
along with um testimony from 130 folks
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%

drugs I also want you to picture the
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
next child coming in who
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
was unfortunately molested by a
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
sibling the next child coming in lives
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
with their grandparent because their
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
house that they lived in was considered
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
um where drugs were um
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
housed the next the next child that

school I'd like to say to you my name is
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
Donna magon welcome to
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
Newport not all of our students have
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
that but I will share with you that a
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
large majority of our
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
students suffer from one of those
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
things I
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
report at least 10 to 15 DCF cases a
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
week if not within 2 to three
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
days our teachers and our staff our
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
parents social workers nurses protectors
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
holder of information whether it's good
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
information or bad information but
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
they're also mandatory mandatory
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
37,39 that is between $6,000 to
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
$10,000 different from our surrounding
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
towns I have 81 teachers of those 81
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
teachers 28 of them are on an
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
alternative plan which means they never
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
went through the education
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
process the the staff turnover and our
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
district can be at times have been 25
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
teachers that we've had to
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
replace I currently have 200 staff
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
members I am missing seven teachers and
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 18
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
staff we are now in our budget season
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
and our budget is is approximately uh 22
 
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
and our budget is is approximately uh 22
million

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
and two days ago I was asked to cut
 
01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.189 align:start position:0%
and two days ago I was asked to cut
$848,000

01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
$848,000
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
from that budget because of the tax
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
impact it will have on our
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
community the 2223 school year the cost
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
22,27 the tax impact on our community is
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
causing a number of our families to lose
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
their homes so as I sit here today I ask
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%

welcome we have no more cards on on this
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh so we are going to close the
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on the base adequacy portion of
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
this and we're going to move into the
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
next bill which deals with the
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid component of special
 
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
education and a lot of the discussion
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
here on this one is going to be very
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what we heard I'm I'm sure um
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
just a little background for where we've
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
been as a policy Committee in the past
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
we recognize the need for a weighted
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
formula in this
 
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
formula in this
category

01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
um uh the present allocations $2,100
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
this this uh particular Bill moves it to
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
27,000 so representative do you have a a
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
pink card for us did I submitted it
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
earlier you got it ear oh it's on the
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
same okay yes welcome thank you um again
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Lauren seelig I
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
represent Durham New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill on behalf of myself
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
but also representative Kennedy who is
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor um who sent me his
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll read that and then
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
make a couple of additional comments if
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
you don't mind um thank you Mr chairman
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the education committee I
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
again apologize for not being present as
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'm still in law school classes and I
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank representative selig for
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill for me this bill
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
is straightforward and increases the
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
cost for students receiving special
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
education services specifically if you
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
look at section 2D it raises the amount
 
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.910 align:start position:0%
look at section 2D it raises the amount
from

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
$2,100 to 27,000 for those receiving
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
special education services as you will
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from individuals who work
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
in special education this amount is
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
what's necessary for student in special
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
education program to receive an ad
 
01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
education program to receive an ad
adequate

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
education and so in addition to
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny's comments um I
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
will say I am the proud mother of an IEP
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
student who is also a member of the
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
National Honor Society because she is an
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly hardworking student but she's
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
also been able thankfully to receive the
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
support that she needs um she was
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as having a learning
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
disability in second grade um now that
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
she's a junior in high school her
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
learning disability has has not
 
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
magically disappeared as a lot of Us
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
wish it would um but we've learned a lot
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
of strategies to cope with her learning
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
challenges and to help her be successful
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
in school um she is a mild learning
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
disability she is not one of the more
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
severely uh needy children that we have
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
in our district um however she meets
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
with her special education case manager
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
um three times a week as part of her uh
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
Services um that case manager also has a
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
par professional who works with her who
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
assists my daughter in understanding
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
things like how to survive chemistry
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
class um something I'm not sure most of
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
us could do in regardless of a learning
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
ability or not um but also as she is
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
currently in her Civics education class
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
and fully capable of explaining to her
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
Civics teacher what it is a state
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative does what the difference
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
is between state government and local
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
government but as she prepares for the
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
um the citizenship test and looks at the
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
way the questions are structured the
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
language of those questions is so
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
confusing to her that she is is unlikely
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
to pass that test on for multiple
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
occasions until she can understand the
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
structure of the question so in order
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
for her to get the kind of support she
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
needs someone has to work with her to
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
help her read through those questions
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
create some kind of study system so that
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
she can make sense of what's being asked
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's not that she can't explain the
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
content it's that much of the time she
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
is blocked from understanding the way
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
the questions are phrased right um she
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
is likely to go on to college and
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
college thankfully her IEP will follow
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
her and she be able to get support
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
services at whatever college she attends
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
but the cost of educating her is far
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
more than it was for my daughter who did
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
not have any special needs and who in
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
fact was able to tutor peers in her
 
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
classes as she went through school she
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
my older daughter did not require tutor
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
she did not require someone to sit down
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
and spend hours breaking down
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
information into sections and chunking
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
it out for her she did not require her
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers to make copies of
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
notes in advance for her to highlight
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
and fill in but all of those things are
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
essential services for my other daughter
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
who as I said has a mild learning
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
disability um I have friends whose
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
daughters have um dyslexia who have all
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
sorts of additional special needs we
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
have kids in our district who have Down
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
syndrome who have a wide variety of
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
needs and other types of Developmental
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
delays um and I also have a friend whose
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
um child has been sent to an outof
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
District residential placement for six
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
years those costs are astronomical and
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
far exceed the 27,000 even listed here
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
so I urge the committee to recognize
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to increase funding as a
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
state we need to help support our
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers across the state and um I'm
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
open to taking any questions thank you
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very are there any questions
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
for represent s yes represent
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
leus yes I was I
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
was looking at um the numbers and having
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
a flat rate like
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
that I wondered what happens in a
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
district where you have a small district
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
with a very expensive student student
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
versus perhaps a larger District that
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
only has smaller expense students times
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
27 you would end up with a great
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and I was wondering if you
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
were amable to coming up with something
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
more graduate you know graduated to help
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
account for those differences yes thank
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
you so much for the question so I am not
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
the expert in figuring out all the
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
financial formulas we do have some
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
experts here including um Jane berson
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
who will be testifying shortly who is an
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
much more of an expert in this field and
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
may be able to give you more Nuance
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm not sure if that's what
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
she'll be able to do or not I I don't
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
have an objection to um the state
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
structuring it in such a way that we are
 
01:34:39.629 --> 01:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're funding
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately based on the number of
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
special education students again there
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
are some students who require a huge
 
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and some who require a
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
smaller dollar amount um but
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
proportionately across the state I think
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
the percentages of special education
 
01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:57.159 align:start position:0%
students District to District are
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
similar it's just that the costs vary
 
01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
depending on on what the needs are and
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
where they are and very year to year
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
right as people relocate and as people
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
graduate thank you before we go with any
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
further questions in the area of special
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
education here there's two sources of
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
revenue for special education in the
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
state and one of those we're not
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
involved with that is the catastrophic
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
we call it special education Aid now
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's a formula once you get three and
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
a half times the average cost then you
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
go up 80% to 10 times that and and the
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
state has certain costing
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in that we're talking
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
about the portion right now it's
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid dealing with 13 IEP
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
categories um and how we're going to
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
fund those categories uh so uh let's
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
stay away from the cat Aid stuff that's
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh totally out of our Bailey wick for
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
all of us right right here so are there
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representa
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
celik thank you very much thank you all
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
so much and I look forward to seeing you

again um if not later today then later

01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
week okay we have Zach Sheen
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
and is hope I'm a little confused how
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
here okay you're speaking behalf of
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else okay okay you're
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
welcome hello again Zach Shen um New

Hampshire school funding fairness
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
project um we're speaking in support of
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
1656 uh I just want to highlight a few
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
things some of which some of the
 
01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
questions we're we're getting at
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
um since we're now talking we're going
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
from base Aid to the special education
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid piece um currently um
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
including that in the calculation of
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy is on one hand an omission and
 
01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement by the state that
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
students who receive special education
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
services those Services cost more money
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
they need those services to achieve at
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
the same level of their peers as you
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
just heard from the previous
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um during the 2021 2022 school
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
year um just under 30,000 students in
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
our Public School System receive special
 
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.270 align:start position:0%
our Public School System receive special
education

01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
services um however the addition $2,100
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
per student receiving those special
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
education services does not come even
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
remotely close to the amount of money it
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
actually costs to provide these Services
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
the actual additional funding um if you
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
take the number of students receiving
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
the services and number additional Ser
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
um number of additional funding was
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
about $28,000 per student so I believe
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's where this $27,000 number came
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
from yes it's exactly round it's a
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
starting point it's just about what the
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
average additional cost actually is by
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
increasing the special education
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid to $227,000 per pupil
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's an equality approach to
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative lak's Point earlier it's
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
not an equity approach so some districts
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
would it wouldn't exactly match that up
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
but it would be a significant step
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
towards making sure that students are
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
able to weather the able to provide the
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
services they need for their students
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
they are not having as much Financial
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuation year-to year special
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
education costs accounted for about $840
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
million during the 2021 2022 school year
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
which about 25% of toal New Hampshire
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
education expenditures and every school
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
district shares those responsibilities
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
and is indeed required by state and
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
federal law to provide a lot of these
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
services but just like the rest of our
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
funding system in New Hampshire most of
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
that was borne by local property
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in fact the state only
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
contributed 7.3% of the actual cost of
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
special education services through the
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula if you add on the um
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
other Aid that was just being mentioned
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only 11% of total special
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
education expenditures that were covered
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
state due to this broken funding system
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
and heav Reliance on local property
 
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
taxes these changes in funding and the
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
amount of volatility here really put
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
strains on everyone's school budget and
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
specifically smaller School
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
budgets um hb1 1656 provides you all a
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
legislative option to move in a positive
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
direction it might not be the perfect
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill or the perfect number right now but
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
I really encourage the subcommittee to
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
take this seriously look at the
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in current special education
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
Aid versus actual expenditures
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
and figure how how to get closer to
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
providing our schools with the amount of
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
money that they actually need happy to
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
much uh that 1656 I have that card and

hope Damon Sullivan District 8 um I am
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
reading remarks from Timothy Kuman who
 
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
is the director of special ed for wiwam
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
school district because the weather and
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
his kids Transportation needs prevented
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
him from being here
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and so he says bear with
 
01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
me so I can
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
see my name is Tim cuman and I'm
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
currently the director of student
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%

sand Borton and Tilton this is my 25th
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
year in education all the two of which
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
has been in the field of special
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
education much has changed in this field
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
since 1998 for many parent procedural
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards to the prevalence and
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
significance of disabilities in our
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
Public School System wanting warranting
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
more extensive and creative programming
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
for students with disabilities however
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
what has changed little over that same
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
period of time is the extent that the
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
federal government and the state of New
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has contributed to districts
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
to cover necessary costs associated with
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
all children but especially higher costs
 
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
associated with children with
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities without going into great
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
detail regarding my perspective of what
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
we know is inadequate about the
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
education funding system in the state I
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
can confidently tell you that the
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
financial impact for those that it
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
burdens the most local taxpayers is
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
significant whether it is the local

01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
disability I wholeheartedly appreciate
 
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
and fully support what the sponsors of
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
1656 are trying to accomplish by putting
 
01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
forward this piece of leg
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
legislation as you can see funding for
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
special ed has far behind the changing
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
nature of state and federal law and what
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
those legal obligations require public
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
districts to shoulder mostly on their
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
own as a committee please strongly
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
consider your support for this bill as
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
it will put the burden more where it
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
belongs on the state to provide this
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
piece of what is considered an adequate
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
education for at least this aspect of
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
our student population thank you and I
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
look forward to further discussion about
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
how this new law could benefit the
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire respectfully
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
submitted Tim krian director of student
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
service Services when school district um

and if I may parenthetically say I
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
personally know Tim and you could not
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
imagine a more dedicated
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
educator thank you thank you very much
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
seeing you just read that in for Tim
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
you're not going to take questions for
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
Kim thank

Oregon if if you want to speak on this
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%

here these these are all yeah thank you
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman I submitted two
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
cards at 9:00 or 1686 on the top okay
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
there it
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
is yeah yeah yeah all right okay sorry I
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
TR to they're here go ahead represent my
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
apologies you're already running behind
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
schedule another card on top of that yes
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
I understood yes I was so um I'm a
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor 1656 and um I think already
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
sent put out some written testimony
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
which actually I was going to bring a
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
print out of for myself but um so and I
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't need read it verbatim anyway so
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
the uh one thing as the uh and I'm sure
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
the uh representa Cel my fellow Durham
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative I only saw a little bit
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
of her uh testimony on uh this the uh on
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
the Clos caption video but I'm sure it
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
was excellent and to the point probably
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
made the point much better than I could
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
um but so this uh first of all this bill
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
it is does have a very high price tag um
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's pretty uh pretty daunting
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually but both the Department of
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
Education who wrote the fiscal note and
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school funding
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
fairness project agree well they're off
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
by a few hundred, but that's uh not much
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's not much money the largest game
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
of things that it cost the school
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
districts pay about $685 million for uh
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
special ed education funding and so the
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
state only currently only kicks in about
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh 35 million so this will um ask the
 
01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
state to raise $650 million of
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
luckily the way this bill is written
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
unlike the previous one they don't have
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
to do that until uh July 1st 2025 which
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
means both the spending and the revenue
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
will also have to be dealt with by
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know the next legislature probably
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
by the law of averages about a third of
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
us will move on to other things by then
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
um but most of us will still be around
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll still be and all of us will
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
still be concerned about these issues
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
but um and that's a daunting it's a
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
daunting task but I I think it can be
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
done when way as I said this state wi
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
property tax I'm not a big fan of it but
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
it does exist it does work um and people
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
would actually not see much difference
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
their tax bills that they would get even
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
though they still be absurdly high won't
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
be any higher or much different than
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
they would be otherwise
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
and and so the same arguments about
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
fairness because school districts have
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
different uh resources apply to if that
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
applies to this bill there's also
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
additional fact that it's kind of random
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
so like uh there's some special
 
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
education uh cases that are you know
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are fairly small amounts of
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
money fairly simple uh things that have
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
to be done to enable the the child to
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
learn some
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
require h sums of money and it's kind of
 
01:46:24.189 --> 01:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
a so even though the number of students
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
who have INF IEPs well are it's a fairly
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit less than 20% I
 
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
think anyway it's a fairly predictable
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
percentage but it's you don't really
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
know when your school district is going
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
to get a catastrophic case like that and
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
we do have ways of dealing with it I
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
think probably the easiest way is just
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
to um smooth it out and this is a way of
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
spreading it over the entire state which
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
is fairer also the current system
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
discriminates somewh people either from
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
towns poorer towns or families from
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
towns of or families in general who have
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh fewer resources because if your
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
family is is well off you know they'll
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
put a lot of they'll be able to put a
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
lot of more own resources into it and
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
some on who are less well off after
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
theyve been in the school districts U so
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
I think this is a this is a fair Bill
 
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
it'll it's a and it'll like enable it'll
 
01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
enable more students to get the services
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
they need and it will reduce the uh
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
unpredictably inde prence on the test
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
payers so that's uh that's why and I
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
probably replicated everything rep sik
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
says but U I thought I'd put in my two
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
cents anyway or my $685 million as the
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
case may be and you thank you very much
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.189 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.199 --> 01:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
morning good morning my name is Jane

Association of special ed administrators
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
and I am here today representing over
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
250 leaders in the field of special
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
education uh who are supporting this
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill um as you know we're a nonprofit
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
organization um our members come from
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire State they are
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
public school leaders as well as those
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
from our approved private special
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
education schools some of them um are
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
residential uh programs and when we
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
think about um HP 1656 from our lens it
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
really begins to identify the challenges
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about specifically the
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
financial challenges and the inequities
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh related to special education funding
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
in our various School communities as we
 
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
all know the field of special special
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
education is very complex and it's bound
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
by state and federal special education
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
rules which enable us to provide a free
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
and appropriate special education to um
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
all students within our communities
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard about the average cost for
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
educating a student uh with an IEP when
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
you look at the study um that the uh
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
commission did on education um the cost
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
for um educating a student is between
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
with with an IEP is between 35 and
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
$40,000 and the numbers of students uh
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
with IEPs in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
continue to increase as do the uh
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
complexities of the disabilities that
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing within uh the children in
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
in our communities so in summary um HB
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
1656 is really worthy of attention we
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
will hope that you will continue to
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
support it as it goes through the
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee process in hopes that it will
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
begin to address some of the challenges
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
related to uh funding for special
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire thank you
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and for your
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
service uh to the citizens of New
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%

01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative Miler thank
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for being here
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
You' indicated in your testimony that
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's been an increase in the number
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
of special education coded children is
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
there a basis for that increase since we
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
also have a decrease in student
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
population I think you know ferally when
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
we talk to our um folks and when we talk
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
to our own members we're seeing a wide
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons for this one of which
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
um was covid and you know the the lack
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
of Education that students got and they
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
um were exposed to a lot of trauma
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
during that time we're also seeing um
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
the impact of um the opioid crisis um
 
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of students um in families
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
that are opioid involved um we're seeing
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
um a lot of mental health challenges uh
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
with students for a variety of different
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
reasons you know so those those are just
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
some of the examples of you know reasons
 
01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
um that we're seeing a bit of an
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
increase are there further questions
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you thank you
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%

01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
idea where the
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
$227,000 number came from I was not a
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
further

Trumble good morning again David Trumble
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
from the town aware speaking on special
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
education this bill is something that I
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
live with every day my dear wife is a
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
lifelong special education teacher of
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
going on 40 years so when I ask how was
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
your day we're talking about how was
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
special education in the public schools
 
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
today so I want to start with bringing
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
this back to people that special
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
education students what I've learned is
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
are amazing students and people and they
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
deserve to be treated with respect like
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
every other student their legal rights
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
need to be respected like every other
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
students in our state's constitutional
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
duty to fund their education exists like
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
every other student there should be no
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
question that we should fully fund
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
special ed at the state
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
level the rights that special ed
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
students come from a variety of federal
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
laws but they have the right to a free
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
and appropriate education regardless of
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
the nature and severity of their
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
disability and they have the right to
 
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
receive a compr able education to
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
students without disabilities the
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
federal government lists like 13
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
different categories of disabilities it
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
includes hearing impairments Vision
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
blindness multiple disabilities and
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
developmental delays it's a wide range
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
of amazing students that we're talking
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
about here I don't know which set of
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
numbers is easier for you to understand
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
so I'll try a couple different
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
approaches one is the pi approach the
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
town's share of the pie is 81% the
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
state's share of the pie is 11% and the
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
fed's share of the pie is 7% if you go
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
more for dollars towns pay
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
$36,000 per student the state only pays
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 per student if you're more
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
interested in well how much of this as
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
of a local school budget the average in
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the state is a quarter 25% of the school
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
budgets but in many school districts
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's as high as 40 or 45% there's no way
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that school can function properly
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
with such a high percentage so what what
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
does this mean in the real world it
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
comes down to choices the school
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
district in the schools have to say we
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
have to by federal law provide special
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
education services how do we do this how
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
do we provide that to every special Edge
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
student every non-s specialed student
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
and keep the lights on and the roof
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
fixed and the fields fixed if puts towns
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
and cities in a dilemma to make
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
educational choices the special ed
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
students end up getting the brunt of it
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
because people are resentful of that and
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's not fair it's the state's failure
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
to fund that creates that crisis in the
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
first place you have an obligation to
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
fund these students and we should live
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
up to it as a
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
state that's our legal obligation
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a moral obligation there's
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
an old saying that budgets are
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
statements of values when the state only
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
spends 11% of what's needed for special
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
ed students which is lower than for
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
non-sp special ed students and not near
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
its obligation that's telling these
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
students that they are not as valuable
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to fix that thank you very
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%

them make friends my older son's

classroom teacher believed me when I
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
said I thought the excessive noise in
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria was the reason he pushed
 
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
another child in line she reminded Sammy
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
to put on his noise cancelling
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
headphones there was no repeat incident
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
my younger son's classroom teacher and
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
amazing one-on-one have helped Zeke
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
Express his interest in other children
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
in his integrated public preschool these
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
children know that his way of
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
communicating with them involves his
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
touching their arms or hair smiling and
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
running his classmates sit with him at
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
his table to eat snacks they benefit
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
from Zeke's presence and want to be his
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
friend if you aren't the parent of a
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
child with disabilities you might not
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
understand how exceptional this is the
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
terror of children who are isolated
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
bullied and harmed in our Public Schools
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
haunts me the experience of each child
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
varies by School District in part
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
because the state has abdicated its
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility to adequately fund
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
special education leaving it up to the
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
districts themselves this has set up an
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
eerie echo of my grandparents generation
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
where parents out of necessity educated
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
their children at home or at parent L
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
and funded schools like the Great Bay
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
School these were the only alternatives
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the state run lonia state school I
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
encourage those who do not know about
 
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
lonia to familiarize themselves with its
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
history our public schools are not the
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
hell lonia was however I know too many
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
parents who have felt the need to pull
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
their children from public schools
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of adequate
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
resources pass this bill because all of
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's students deserve the
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%

specialist by trade and um I also am
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
active in my town so I'm familiar with
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
the processes of budgeting um and other
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
um aspects of of our our running our
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
school and the costs that are associated
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
with it um I'm also the very proud
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
parent of two children um who have um
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
are both individuals with
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities and receive Services
 
02:00:06.669 --> 02:00:06.679 align:start position:0%
through our school
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
system um I am keenly aware that my
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
children are very different and have
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
very different needs as do all the
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
children who are receiving special
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
education um in the state of New
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and around our country um for
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
me I'm aware that um while one child has
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
very low needs um in terms of services
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
and supports that are have been provided
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
by our school system since the day he
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
walked into the school um at three years
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
old um and will continue through to um
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
to his high school years um the other
 
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
one uses
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
approximately the same amount of
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
services and EXP expense for one child
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
as it would if every child in his
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
classroom had to receive the same s had
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
to receive a regular
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
education and I'm aware um very keenly
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
aware of how that affects our school
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
budget and the ability of our schools to
 
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
um provide
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
services that would benefit all
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
students um I'm a strongly supporting
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um because it will make
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
available more funds to provide services
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
to other students in our town as well um
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
I know we we we have the benefit of um
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
you know scale in our schools and we can
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
provide services but special education
 
02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
is not one of them special education is
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
extremely personal extremely
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
individualistic and extremely important
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
as these individuals are part of our
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
community and in my case part of my
 
02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
family um and our town does an amazing
 
02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
job but it can't do it without adequate
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
funding to support special education so
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you today the entire
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee committee to please support
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
adequate funding for special education
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you thank you
 
02:02:09.629 --> 02:02:09.639 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you thank you if you
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
could drop that off we can put that
 
02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
right into the record your report there
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other folks that have
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
cards for this one because we're at the
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
end of this we're ready to go into the
 
02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:27.639 align:start position:0%
next uh bill so I will close this
 
02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
hearing just one little comment about
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
special education we all recognize
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's extremely important in the state
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
one of the issues we're grappling with
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
is the federal government initially said
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
they pay 40% of the cost they're down
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 9 to 10% of our bud
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
you know they have significantly reduced
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
Monies to this state in terms of special
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
education support so it's being passed
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
down to all of us
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we got to deal with that so what
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to do for the committee I'm
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
going to give them about five minutes to
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
shake it out a little bit here stand up
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
as educators are advised to have people
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
do and and and get a drink of water
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's this is a very dry atmosphere in
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
here uh take your fluids and we'll come
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
back in about 5 minutes and pick the
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:19:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
hand

02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's an unknown cost area that we're
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
not addressing because it doesn't fit
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:20:17.150 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
think again today the next uh Bill we
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
have is HP

02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget program for funding
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%

02:20:30.429 --> 02:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
that bill is represent luno
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative luno the floor is yours

record my name is Dave luno and uh
 
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
represent uh uh the people of marac
 
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
County District 9 which are folks that

live in Hopton and bow but uh I see my
 
02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and all of our
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as uh as being
 
02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide so I'm really happy to uh to
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
be in in this uh in in your presence
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
this morning to introduce House Bill
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
1586 um 1586 is a little bit different
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
than the last two bills that we heard it
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
is um been described uh a few different
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
ways uh I've described it as
 
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive school funding reform uh
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
other people have described it as a
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
school funding overhaul uh for New
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but its official title is a
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget plan and
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
and much of it um came out of the work
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
that was done by the commission to study
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
school funding back in 2020 and uh and
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
evidence for that is in in the
 
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
commission's uh report um fundamentally
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
what it is is um is uh a little bit of a
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
pretty significant departure from how we
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently fund our schools based on a um
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
sort of a formula that uh that treats
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
all school districts equally the um the
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
1586 Foundation opportunity budget
 
02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
design is really about Equitable school
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
funding Equitable for students and
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Equitable for taxpayers and so um I'd
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
like to just take not a whole lot of
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
time uh this morning because as as chair
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
lad has indicated we've got a work
 
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
session day coming up tomorrow that I
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
think we can really get into the Weeds
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
on on all these bills and I think
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be even future work sessions on
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
that so I'd like to try to try to
 
02:22:28.270 --> 02:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat stay at the uh at the you know
 
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot U level when 50,000 I'll go
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
up to 50 I'll go up to 50,000 so so as
 
02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
long as the door in the back of the
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
plane doesn't blast right this is not a
 
02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
last a yeah
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so um um so in the in the in the
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
nutshell uh 1586 addresses the four
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
points from The Claremont uh Claremont 1
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
decision and the four points are Define
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
education cost it fund it and provide
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
accountability uh to it and um let me
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
just take a take a minute to talk about
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
how 1586 does this currently we Define
 
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
an adequate education this came up in an
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
earlier uh discussed on earlier Bill Uh
 
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
current law defines an adequate
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
education uh as uh in in what's called
 
02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
terms of inputs so how many things a a
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
school districts uh School District
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
needs to have in order to uh to operate
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
so so and uh these things are actually
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
what you sort of think they are uh how
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
many U how many student you know what
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
one 130th of a teacher in a classroom 30
 
02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
desks 30 chairs one 500th of a principal
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know books on the shelf stuff stuff
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
like that 1586
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
instead looks at it differently it it
 
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
defines um an adequate education in
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
terms of student performance so in terms
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
of student outcome and um and in general
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can be very
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
proud of in in New Hampshire because our
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
average performing student in New
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh performs among the best um
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the country but uh but as as
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
indicated you know through earlier
 
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on other bills it's just not
 
02:24:18.429 --> 02:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
happening in all of our school districts
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
so uh so and that's where um that's
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
where rightsizing these budgets really
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
can can come in to make sure districts
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
have have uh have the budgets they need
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
to to be able to um to educate their
 
02:24:34.830 --> 02:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
students to a Statewide outcome so we
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
Define an adequate
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
education in terms of student outcome
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide Statewide outcome we cost it
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's the second thing so so how do we
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
go about costing um education for a
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide Statewide outcome well the
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
commission actually looked at 10 years
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
worth of data uh collected by the
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
department from every school district
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
across the state looked at student
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh in all of those districts
 
02:25:03.550 --> 02:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
and were able to connect uh costs for
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
certain things with student outcomes and
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
and remarkably as uh as has been
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
testified earlier as far as the base
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
cost is concerned it really lined up
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
very close to what uh to an an
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
input-based uh um uh costing model uh
 
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
looks like but what it allows us to do
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
is also look at the other factors that
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
go that that are cost drivers for an
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education and these are things
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
that we're all familiar with from the uh
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the current school funding model
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
special education free and reduced price
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
lunch English language Learners and um
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
and for for these things um you could we
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
you you'd actually see in 1586 that for
 
02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
free and U while the while the base
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
would be around that
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
$7,400 Mark the free and reduced price
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
lunch uh premium would be closer to
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per student in that ADM uh
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
$112,000 per students that are English
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
language Learners and
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
$27,000 for for students at special
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
education right on The Mark with the
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
actually the last bill that uh uh that
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
we heard um so that's the second piece
 
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
costing it the third piece funding it
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
and this is where where 1586 takes a a
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
very different tact from our current um
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
um funding scheme um 1586 rather than
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
starting with State
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and ending with local dollars
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is what our current current model
 
02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
does we start with local dollars
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't get you to your
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget then the
 
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
state comes in and gets you there so the
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
state guarantees the funding for that uh
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
for that budget make sure you can get
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
get you there we heard from from several
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
superintendents that hey we just can't
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
get there we've got a tax cap and we
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
can't get there we've got low property
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
values we can't get there we've got high
 
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
needs we can't get there we cost it and
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
we fund it and the state make sure you
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
can get there and then the last part is
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
providing accountability to this and
 
02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
while the current model has a input
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
based and outcomes based is such a such
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
a a great opportunity to provide
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
accountability because it's the type of
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
accountability I think we all like to
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
talk about how are our students
 
02:27:42.269 --> 02:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
doing and if they're not doing that well
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
on average in a certain District let's
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we we give them some help in
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
terms of uh in terms of how to how to
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
get there and um and and and so tying
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
that accountability to student outcomes
 
02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
goes right back to the definition of
 
02:27:58.269 --> 02:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy in
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
1586 um so so uh let's see uh we we
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
talked about how um how 1586 leans into
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
the conval decision given the uh the
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
base cost that it uh that it uses but it
 
02:28:16.349 --> 02:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
also leans into the Rand order as well
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
and contains a um uh a section that uh
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that implements um reform of the
 
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax I know
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's another bill we're going to be
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
hearing uh I think at the end of the day
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
this or at the end of the afternoon that
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
does the same thing as um as that so so
 
02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
we're leaning into Claremont conal and
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
Rand um 1586 has no fiscal note yet
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
clearly there would be a fiscal note um
 
02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
but um but if we take a look look
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
at the 1586 is predecessor which some on
 
02:28:54.429 --> 02:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
this committee may remember from
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
20202 uh House Bill 1680 there while
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a fiscal note on that
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
either we did receive information from
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uh from the Department on um on what
 
02:29:07.389 --> 02:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
the uh what the cost would look like
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
what the total State cost would be and
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
what uh how that would translate down to
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh cities and towns uh throughout the
 
02:29:19.230 --> 02:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
state and um remark ably the uh when you
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
compare those spreadsheets from from
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
2022 which refer the for the fy2 24 and
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
fy2 uh school years the years that we're
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
in right now on this current budget the
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
total State share is um right around the
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
same like plus or minus $10 million out
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
of a you know obviously much higher
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
number than that so so they came in very
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
much on par um so what does this mean
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
mean for the most challenged cities and
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
towns across the state and uh we heard
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
from SE several of them this morning um
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh in FY 24 right now on our actual
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
school funding formula um Berlin
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
receives $ 11.5 million from the um from
 
02:30:09.389 --> 02:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
the state and under the bill we've got
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
in front of us right now that would go
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
up by over a million do Claremont
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
receives $15.6 million from State under
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
current law that would go up again uh by
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
almost um actually over $2 million
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
because of $17.7 million um Pittsfield I
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
think we heard we heard about Pittsfield
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh earlier currently receives $5.3
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
million from the state that would go up
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
to 6.4 and Newport and we heard uh we
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
heard some very I think moving uh
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
stories and facts from uh from and the
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
challenges that Newport faces goes from
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
8.3 $ million under current law to $10.1
 
02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh million and uh that's in the first
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
year of a phase in uh of a seven-year
 
02:30:57.790 --> 02:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
phase in uh that um that
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
1576 uh 1586 sorry contemplate so
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
02:31:08.349 --> 02:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
see just want to make sure I'm sort of
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
covering uh uh things at the 50,000 foot
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
level without flying out the back door
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I think there's changes that uh
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
that that um that 1586 is going to
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
require in order to um uh to be workable
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
since it was a a copy from what we did
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
three years ago obviously things have
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
changed property values have changed the
 
02:31:37.150 --> 02:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
current school funding formula the in
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
law uh has changed and um and
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
enrollments have changed too so we would
 
02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
need to address all of all these factors
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
in uh in New finan Financial um in in
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
new new spreadsheets so um so I guess in
 
02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
summary I would uh I would basically say
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
that um that 1586 is a strong framework
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
for um uh for robust school funding it
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a left half SL right half
 
02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
side of the formula where the right half
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
props up the left half it's just the
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
formula and the formula Works uh doesn't
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a hold harmless again not something
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that that propping up a formula
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work um uh it's it's
 
02:32:22.269 --> 02:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
costing and funding it's defining
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy defining adequacy in terms of
 
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
student outcome um and um and you know I
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
think it's something that uh that that
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
we've been waiting for here in New
 
02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that uh doesn't require us to
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
um to necessarily Envision um new
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources we can work within the
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
state's current Revenue model uh for
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
this so um so I I hope um that sort of
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
sets a reasonable stage for uh for the
 
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning and for the work uh
 
02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
work ahead and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much represent
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
luno are there any questions from the
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
leus I have two questions and I went
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
over this again this morning with my
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
husband and so some of these were sort
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
of joint questions
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
um my first question about the add the
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
um accountability I'm curious why you're
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
only doing accountability for
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
underperforming schools instead of that
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
those accountability things are are
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
great why are you not doing them for all
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
the schools yeah that's a that's a great
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
question and uh and I I think
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
accountability should be done for for
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
all the schools I think that's an area
 
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
we can work on together and um and you
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
know in particular when you look at the
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
accountability uh portion of Bill I
 
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
think the bill is something like 25 26
 
02:33:48.429 --> 02:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
pages and I think it's a good third of
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
it is probably accountability and uh a
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
lot of it is has to do with data
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
collection um and uh being able to make
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we're collecting the the the
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
best data to be able to um to see how
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
students are doing and hold um I don't
 
02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
say hold school districts accountable
 
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
but it is holding School District it's
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
providing them the hand they need to
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that during their budgeting
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
process they're applying the foundation
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget that uh that that
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
moves the for their kids and then the
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
second question I may um I'm
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
wondering it I maybe I missed it but
 
02:34:28.439 --> 02:34:32.469 align:start position:0%
wondering it I maybe I missed it but
what

02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
happens if a school does not meet the
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
goals what is what other
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
than having them come up with a plan Etc
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
but what what then happen yeah the
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
department gives them some help in in
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
terms of their their you know U their
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
their budget plan and the foundation
 
02:34:57.630 --> 02:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is is defined pretty
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
well the total the the bottom line cost
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
is defined pretty well we know what goes
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
into the bottom line cost based on what
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
districts are currently doing and uh and
 
02:35:10.269 --> 02:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we can the the
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
department would be able to help in
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
terms of well maybe you want to look at
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
this type of programming or or do
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
something different that's that's going
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
to um really um be be responsive to
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
students interests and and their uh
 
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
their their um um uh educational
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes okay thank you thank you for
 
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
the question forther questions from the
 
02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any hands thank you
 
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you members of committee like call
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%

02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
hi so I'm pleased to be here I was
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
honored to serve on the uh commission
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
that studied school funding a few years
 
02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
ago um and my time in uh looking at
 
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
school funding issues actually goes back
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
very long way I started out in
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in
 
02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
1979 I think it was I was General
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
Council for the Secretary of Education
 
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:28.110 align:start position:0%
Council for the Secretary of Education
in

02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:36:31.269 --> 02:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and uh papers were served
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
as I said there um in the very first
 
02:36:38.269 --> 02:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
school funding litigation in
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which was based on
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions that are in
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts Constitution that that
 
02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
are very similar to the provisions that
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
are in the New Hampshire
 
02:36:56.349 --> 02:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that case um which had
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
a different name then but became the
 
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.190 align:start position:0%
a different name then but became the
McDuffy

02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
McDuffy
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
case um led to a conclusion by the
 
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
case um led to a conclusion by the
Massachusetts

02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
court try to get it right
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
here um the Massachusetts Supreme Court
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
which is called the mass to the Supreme
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
Judicial Court
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
um invalidated the Commonwealth's then
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
school funding system and made two
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
distinct Holdings that the state's
 
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution's education Clause imposes
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
on the Commonwealth an enforceable duty
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
to provide a public education for all
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
its children rich and poor in every city
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
and town and that the Commonwealth had
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
failed to satisfy that Duty in the case
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the students from property poor
 
02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
communities who were plaintiffs in the
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
case that all I'm sure sounds familiar
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
to you that kind of situation so here we
 
02:37:59.790 --> 02:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
are in massach in New Hampshire and uh
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
the McDuffy court that I just quoted
 
02:38:07.469 --> 02:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
from uh came was handed down in June
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
1993 well uh it wasn't long after that
 
02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh Claremont one decision in
 
02:38:16.479 --> 02:38:17.590 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh Claremont one decision in
December

02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
December
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
1993 was handed down the New Hampshire
 
02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:22.190 align:start position:0%
1993 was handed down the New Hampshire
Supreme

02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
Court uh looked and quoted from the
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
McDuffy case the Massachusetts case in
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
several places in their opinion and like
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
the uh McDuffy case found that the
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
education Clause now were into the New
 
02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:40.030 align:start position:0%
education Clause now were into the New
Hampshire

02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh imposes a duty on the
 
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
legislative and executive branches of
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
State government and to quote uh the New
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Court we hold that part two
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
article 83 imposes a duty on the state
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
to provide a constitutionally adequate
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
education to every educable child in the
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
public schools in New Hampshire and to
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee adequate funding end quote and
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
in doing that they gave weight to the
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
McDuffy case because they said New
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire modeled its constitution on
 
02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire modeled its constitution on
Massachusetts

02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and included in that
 
02:39:24.670 --> 02:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution a nearly this is quoting
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh New Hampshire Court uh
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
including a quote nearly identical
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
provision regarding education
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
unquote um so fast forwarding to our
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
situation now um well let me let me uh
 
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
first say that uh pursuant to the
 
02:39:51.469 --> 02:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
McDuffy case Massachusetts went on to
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
work within the legislature under uh the
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
threat of further judicial intervention
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
to create a comprehensive school funding
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
system that's known in Massachusetts as
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Chapter 70 programs that that's a
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
chapter of their general laws and uh
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's a very comprehensive um system
 
02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's been modified as years have gone
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
by but it stood the test of time and uh
 
02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
the fun on the funding side of that it
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
by the way is an input based system we
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about input based and
 
02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
outcomes based ways of figuring out what
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
the uh uh cost of an adequate education
 
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
is but um the Massachusetts uh came down
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
with an input based system and for the
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
funding for the funding of that system
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
they established
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh essentially let's call it two
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
sources uh one is local and the other is
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
state to meet that constitutional
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
obligation so um this there's a a
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution provision in the
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts system and then state aid
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
and the minimum contribution which is
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
locality by locality and comes out of
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
property tax revenues it varies
 
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
property tax revenues it varies
inversely

02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
inversely
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the property tax wealth of a
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
particular uh Community um so a poor
 
02:41:25.469 --> 02:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
Community uh facing significant
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
educational costs would be expected to
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh pay a much smaller share of the cost
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
of what they call a foundation budget uh
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
which is the phrasing actually in the
 
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
bill before you um uh than a a
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
well-to-do uh District which would pay
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh more like uh 85 to 100% of the cost
 
02:41:54.269 --> 02:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh out of their local property tax
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
revenues um and that's basically the
 
02:42:00.750 --> 02:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
system in in 16 in uh in 15 I almost
 
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
said 1680 1586 well it was 1680 it looks
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
very similar it does uh so um let me
 
02:42:15.150 --> 02:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
just get over to one last part of this
 
02:42:17.950 --> 02:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
but way a lot of this material that I
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
grabbed when I realized I I might uh my
 
02:42:25.710 --> 02:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
talk here is from the um commission's
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
report the published report it's in the
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
appendix I think it's appendix C of the
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh commission's report uh and it
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
discusses this question of uh of state
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
and local contributions and the
 
02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of them um and I would
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
say that uh our court that uh the New
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has never
 
02:42:51.389 --> 02:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
examined a system similar to what has
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
been done in Massachusetts the Chapter
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
70 program which is a system which
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
requires communities to exercise their
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
local property tax power to raise a
 
02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
strict minimum local contribution that
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
is designed by the state to vary Inver
 
02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
inversely with local community wealth
 
02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
and that must be devoted to meeting the
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
foundation budget in our case the
 
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy spending requirement all of
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
which operate together in a highly
 
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
integrated manner with state aid to
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
achieve um a good result and um the the
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh one other aspect of this uh way of
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
approaching things that I would
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
underscore is
 
02:43:45.309 --> 02:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
that it it reflects a a concept that I I
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
think is fundamental to the way uh in
 
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
which um public
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
education um should be provided there's
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
a partnership between the state and the
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
local um local school districts it's not
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
the state uh telling the localities what
 
02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
to do and providing all the money it's a
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
shared obligation and responsibility
 
02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
overseen by the state because the state
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
is the enforcer of the Constitution but
 
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh essentially Mo all education is
 
02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
happening at the local level and the
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
funding is as I've described it uh in
 
02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
that system and in the system that's
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
proposed here by um by in this bill and
 
02:44:36.590 --> 02:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'd say is that I fully
 
02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
recognize that uh there is language that
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
has been used by our court uh over the
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
years since the first uh Claremont
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
decision um that might give uh that does
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
give um support to the view that the
 
02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
state has to pay every last cent of the
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education and
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
nothing can come out of the
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
localities um but I I believe as I said
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
before that the Irish court has never
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
directly addressed that issue in the
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
context of a system that is designed
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
carefully to be responsible and to
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh there's an successful uh
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh outcome to uh The Joint Partnership
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
of the state and locality and uh um we
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
may need to uh we may need that input
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
from the uh uh Supreme Court to go
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
forward but I think there's nothing
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
stopping this legislature from making
 
02:45:42.269 --> 02:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
its own judgments about what is
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate and uh the degree to which
 
02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
it can vary from um The View that uh all
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
all must be paid for by the state once
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's defined as adequacy I think we can
 
02:45:57.870 --> 02:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
do differently than that and I think we
 
02:46:02.429 --> 02:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
must in order to succeed in our Endeavor
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
to get over this hurdle and finally go
 
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
forward on uh uh a fully funded adequate
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
education program in uh uh or a fully
 
02:46:15.469 --> 02:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
funded Foundation program and whatever
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
you want to call it uh in uh New
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that works well for everybody
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that uh uh gets us off of being
 
02:46:27.630 --> 02:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
stuck because we can't pay for it thank
 
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
you very much representative um yes that
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
is a hurdle
 
02:46:35.070 --> 02:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
but we'll deal with it uh questions from
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
the committee representa cordelli thank
 
02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Ames for
 
02:46:41.550 --> 02:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
being here and your testimony um you
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned um you're not telling
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities what to do but it seems
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
to me you are doing exactly that on page
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
17 with mandated property tax relief
 
02:46:57.070 --> 02:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
even specifying household income amounts
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
AR aren't you dictating or wouldn't the
 
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
state be dictating to municipalities
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
what they should be doing I'm not sure
 
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do do you want to get are you getting
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
down to a lower level here where we
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
can't do that tomorrow
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
all right you know because represent
 
02:47:19.230 --> 02:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
Ames is on that committee and you're on
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
that committee too we can have a nice
 
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
chat we can have a good chat there you
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
go representative cascaden thank you Mr
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh representative
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I'm not sure
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you know this answer but just
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
to get an example or um a monetary
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
estimate on what the McDuffy case uh how
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
after that settlement how the state of
 
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um
 
02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know settle that to be able to pay
 
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
for their adequacy I mean what what was
 
02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
the source of Revenue and do you have
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
any idea how much they needed to raise I
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
um uh sorted out in Massachusetts so
 
02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
um uh sorted out in Massachusetts so
that

02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.590 align:start position:0%
that
roughly

02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
um roughly 42 or 43% something like that
 
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
is uh is um
 
02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:17.670 align:start position:0%
is uh is um
oh

02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
boy I think that that's the state dollar
 
02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
amount um and then um there's maybe 10%
 
02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
Federal money and uh the rest would be
 
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh from the local property
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
tax and that it varies greatly from
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
Community to
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
community follow up yeah we will be
 
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
having another person speaking I might
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
be able to give you that question yeah
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and please understand
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
I couldn't hear you yeah that's fine
 
02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I just uh I've given you
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
some numbers and I stand to be corrected
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong thank you very much thank
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
you I think we'll go on to the next uh
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
presenter here and I'd like to have
 
02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:04.150 align:start position:0%
presenter here and I'd like to have
Andrew

02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
Andrew
 
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
yours minutes no no because we only have
 
02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
a couple here
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't have a lot of cards like
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
before on this one I me to good morning
 
02:49:28.110 --> 02:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify my
 
02:49:33.070 --> 02:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
name is Andrew balinsky uh I happen to
 
02:49:36.229 --> 02:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
live in East conquer my wife Amy and I
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
have three children of whom we're very
 
02:49:41.790 --> 02:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
proud our son Josh is a middle school
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
science teacher at a public school in
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
Denver our daughter Molly was a social
 
02:49:51.229 --> 02:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
worker in a challenging High School in
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
Harlem for 5 years and our other
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
banker um I I want to preface my remarks
 
02:50:06.990 --> 02:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
in two ways uh first I really like and
 
02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
respect dick Ames um I listen to what he
 
02:50:15.229 --> 02:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
says um I'm troubled that I am here
 
02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
to contest part of his
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and though although I
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
respect the sponsors of this bill
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
um their position to me is heartbreaking
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
because I think the bill violates the
 
02:50:36.229 --> 02:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:50:39.070 --> 02:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution as it was described and
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
explained in the Claremont and London da
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
decisions and I'll get into that um the
 
02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:48.389 align:start position:0%
decisions and I'll get into that um the
other

02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
preface is I'm just blown away by the
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
testimony you've heard this morning and
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
I hope it's had an impact on you school
 
02:50:58.349 --> 02:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
districts are struggling across the
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
state which means administrators and
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and other educators are
 
02:51:06.269 --> 02:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
struggling and of course this impacts
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
the children in our school districts and
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
our economy as you've heard John Adams
 
02:51:15.229 --> 02:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
one of the fathers of Education in our
 
02:51:17.309 --> 02:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
country wrote the Massachusetts
 
02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
education Clause we lifted it from
 
02:51:23.309 --> 02:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the purpose of that
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
Clause is to is to protect the
 
02:51:29.910 --> 02:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
Democracy that's why we have education
 
02:51:32.590 --> 02:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution and it happens to be
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the part of the Constitution part two
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
that deals with the form of government
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's not in part one where individual
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
rights are so that gives you a flavor
 
02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
for how uh the founders thought about
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
education in this
 
02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
context so I was lead counsel in the
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
Claremont cases I am co-counsel now in
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the Rand litigation case one of the two
 
02:52:03.389 --> 02:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
pending cases uh in uh on November 20th
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
judge ruoff issued his partial decision
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
in our case about the swept the rest of
 
02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
our case uh as uh my colleague in the
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
case Natalie laflam U mentioned is
 
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing my other state colleague is John
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
Tobin uh another lawyer from conquer um
 
02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
The Claremont principles can be boiled
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
down to one
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph the state has a
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to define the components
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
of a constitutionally adequate
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
education in a clear Common Sense
 
02:52:46.269 --> 02:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
generally understandable
 
02:52:49.229 --> 02:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
fashion once those components are
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
identified they need to be fairly and
 
02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
objectively costed
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
out once that costing out
 
02:53:03.309 --> 02:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
occurs the state needs to pay for
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
everything everything that it's that it
 
02:53:10.269 --> 02:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
has identified as a component of a
 
02:53:13.469 --> 02:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education that
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
is what our court has said
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and fourth there needs to be
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
an accountability component of the
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
definition and so you don't have to take
 
02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
my word for it with your permission I
 
02:53:32.590 --> 02:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
just want to quote four sentences from
 
02:53:35.190 --> 02:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
the London Dairy School District case
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
this was 2006 this is after all the
 
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
Claremont cases were finished Justice
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hicks for the court wrote quote any
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
definition of constitutional adequacy
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
crafted by the political branches must
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
be sufficiently clear to permit common
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and allow for an objective
 
02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
determination of costs whatever the
 
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
state identifies as comprising
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy it must pay for
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
none of that financial obligation can be
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
shifted to local school districts
 
02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of their relative wealth or
 
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
need that's just one paragraph from
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
probably a dozen or 14 decisions on the
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
subject from our Supreme Court so what
 
02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
is my coral and why do I oppose
 
02:54:33.439 --> 02:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
is my coral and why do I oppose
1586

02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
1586
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
1586 um switches the way in which the
 
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
state defines adequacy from an input to
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
an output model in and of itself that's
 
02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
not a
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
problem but in
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
switching the bill produces what is
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
essentially a successful schools model
 
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
it tells you the scores that must be
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
achieved without identifying the
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
components in those successful schools
 
02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
that make them
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
successful and so without identifying
 
02:55:16.510 --> 02:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
the components you can't fairly and
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
objectively cost out
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy and not to be
 
02:55:26.830 --> 02:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
unfair the legislature doesn't deserve
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the doubt in costing out
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy it needs to be able to show its
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
homework how did you arrive at the
 
02:55:38.190 --> 02:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
number in
 
02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
question and without identifying the
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
components in a
 
02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear way that permits a
 
02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:50.469 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear way that permits a
common

02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
common
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
understanding we're all left to guess so
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's a retreat from Claremont and
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
londondary in that
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
regard the bill then chooses to adopt a
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
model both representative luno and
 
02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:11.590 align:start position:0%
model both representative luno and
representative

02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
Ames have in passing made clear why that
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
model was adopted it was adopted because
 
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
it cost less than fairly paying for
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy and targeted Aid which is
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
different from
 
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to paying for adequacy
 
02:56:35.229 --> 02:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
which is the New Hampshire standard is
 
02:56:37.910 --> 02:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
not permitted under our state
 
02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
constitution as repeatedly interpreted
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
by our Supreme Court I I'm might add
 
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
that John and Natalie and I interact
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
with our colleagues Across the Nation
 
02:56:54.349 --> 02:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
who do this kind of funding and we
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
understand that New Hampshire has set
 
02:57:01.870 --> 02:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
one of the highest standards in the
 
02:57:05.349 --> 02:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
nation for the educational Protections
 
02:57:08.229 --> 02:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
in our Constitution and that's because
 
02:57:11.469 --> 02:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
we were successful in
 
02:57:14.670 --> 02:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
marrying educational adequacy
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of school
 
02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
children and taxpayer equity for the
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of the people who have to pay
 
02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:23.790 align:start position:0%
benefit of the people who have to pay
for

02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
education and the latter total credit
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
goes to John Tobin who insisted we
 
02:57:33.070 --> 02:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
pursue both prongs and fortunately our
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
court adopted and made rulings on both
 
02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
prongs that is why the standard is so
 
02:57:43.309 --> 02:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
high I'd like to say a word about the
 
02:57:45.950 --> 02:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
commission that's been repeatedly
 
02:57:48.429 --> 02:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned I don't know if the members of
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
this committee know how that commission
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
came apart came to
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
be it happened because a series of
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
events led John Tobin Doug Hall and me
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
to present over 70 seminars across this
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
state called Ed funding
 
02:58:13.389 --> 02:58:13.399 align:start position:0%
101 where we taught citizens how
 
02:58:16.830 --> 02:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
education funding Works in this state
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
that was such a successful effort that
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
we three approached the house leadership
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
at the time and asked them to convene
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
what became this commission and to fund
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
it and I'm sad to say that the
 
02:58:36.990 --> 02:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
commission didn't finish all of its work
 
02:58:39.229 --> 02:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to look at funding
 
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
sources in addition to defining adequacy
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
it was to establish the components of
 
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy that our Supreme Court
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
requires I understand that people like
 
02:58:59.950 --> 02:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives aim Ames and luno and
 
02:59:02.309 --> 02:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
Miler and my friend bill aringer is
 
02:59:05.229 --> 02:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
going to speak after me all support a
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid approach and they were all
 
02:59:09.790 --> 02:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
instrumental in the commission's work
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't make it
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.590 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't make it
constitutional

02:59:14.590 --> 02:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
I want to add one word about
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
accountability which uh representative
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
Lex leus
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is an account
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
accountability provision in HB
 
02:59:31.469 --> 02:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
1586 that requires the superintendent in
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
an unsuccessful District to create a
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
report about how to improve and to get
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
St stakeholder Buy in there's no extra
 
02:59:43.990 --> 02:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
money in that bill for a struggling
 
02:59:47.070 --> 02:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
District there's no specific requirement
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
of how the state will help that
 
02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:52.309 align:start position:0%
of how the state will help that
struggling

02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
02:59:55.950 --> 02:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
district and it's almost as if the
 
02:59:59.070 --> 02:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
drafters were unaware of the federal
 
03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
legislation on
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
this there is a portion of Essa which is
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
the big
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
federal education plan that sets
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
standards for what are called
 
03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support and improve
 
03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
schools they are schools with the lowest
 
03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
5% of Title One scores and the lowest
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
graduation rates for a high
 
03:00:28.229 --> 03:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
school these schools get special money
 
03:00:31.389 --> 03:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
and special assistance to
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
improve currently Franklin has two
 
03:00:37.389 --> 03:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
schools on this list Manchester has two
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
schools and NASA has two schools there's
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
a second category called targeted
 
03:00:47.110 --> 03:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
support and Improvement for schools that
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
are just a little less
 
03:00:52.110 --> 03:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
bad Stevens High School Franklin High
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
School uh two the Manchester High
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
Schools new high school summersworth
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
high school are all on that list and
 
03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
they're all currently getting extra fed
 
03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
money and extra um assistance in
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
designing programs to improve their
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
outputs we don't need a redundant
 
03:01:14.510 --> 03:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
program that requires superintendent to
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
do work that's going to get filed on a
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
shelf if a district is failing we need
 
03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
to help that District
 
03:01:25.150 --> 03:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
improve that often
 
03:01:30.229 --> 03:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
requires careful support and additional
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
resources and this bill doesn't quite do
 
03:01:38.349 --> 03:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
that so um I
 
03:01:42.229 --> 03:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
I I know MC Duffy was
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm friends with the lawyers
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
who litigated McDuffy I know exactly
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
what it means I know exactly why the

received at Stevens High School
 
03:04:07.950 --> 03:04:07.960 align:start position:0%

York um I am here also because I served
 
03:04:39.229 --> 03:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
with representative lad uh
 
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative luno representative Ames
 
03:04:44.429 --> 03:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
I served on the commission to study
 
03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I was appointed by and
 
03:04:48.990 --> 03:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative Myer and I was uh
 
03:04:52.030 --> 03:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
appointed by Governor Chris anunu as his
 
03:04:55.229 --> 03:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
designate to that commission um I
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
enjoyed the work on the commission very
 
03:04:59.830 --> 03:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
much and I fully support the
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
commission's work and its report um
 
03:05:07.030 --> 03:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
lastly I would I would mention that um
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
as part of my interest in this uh that
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
I've been uh an admirer
 
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the work that lawyers like attorney
 
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
valinsky and attorney Tobin have done to
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
bring the Claremont litigation
 
03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
originally and and
 
03:05:28.590 --> 03:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
Achieve at the very least and we can
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
I'll focus in close the Claremont one
 
03:05:32.830 --> 03:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
decision which said that the state of
 
03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representative am said
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is responsible for making sure that
 
03:05:43.229 --> 03:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
every child in this state has access to
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
to a high
 
03:05:47.309 --> 03:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
quality public
 
03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
education and they must make sure that
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
the funding is there to support that
 
03:05:58.349 --> 03:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
Duty and fulfillment of that Duty that
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
is the clont one decision uh like the
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
McDuffy decision in mass is one of the
 
03:06:07.790 --> 03:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
best and most historic decisions of our
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court and I want
 
03:06:11.469 --> 03:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
to make clear before I go through it
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
that I support that
 
03:06:17.550 --> 03:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
why am I a supporter of House Bill uh
 
03:06:21.550 --> 03:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
1586 and the commission report
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
because it focuses on an assessment of
 
03:06:30.030 --> 03:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of various districts and then
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
it focuses the
 
03:06:36.790 --> 03:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
funding on the districts with the
 
03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:38.469 align:start position:0%
funding on the districts with the
greatest

03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
need so I let's make sense of this I
 
03:06:45.309 --> 03:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
grew up in Claremont Stevens High School
 
03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
our education was extremely good there
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
they face unique challenges there are
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
other communities in the state that
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the same challenges maybe
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have as many lowincome
 
03:07:00.670 --> 03:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
families maybe they don't have as many
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
students who have uh special needs and
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
may be uh needing extra services for
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
special education maybe they have a a
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
weaker property tax base and they can't
 
03:07:15.790 --> 03:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
meet the obligations to their children
 
03:07:21.150 --> 03:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
without um going to specially difficult
 
03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
burdens I support that house bill 1586
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
because the formula that's in there ends
 
03:07:33.389 --> 03:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
up directing more state aid to the
 
03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
communities with greatest
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
need um Our obligation under Clara the
 
03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
legislator's obligation under CL mon is
 
03:07:44.120 --> 03:07:45.150 align:start position:0%
legislator's obligation under CL mon is
to

03:07:45.150 --> 03:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
support uh and ensure that and to
 
03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
guarantee that every child in the state
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
gets a shot at a good education
 
03:07:58.870 --> 03:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live so let's
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
think about two policy choices one is to
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a formula that identifies special
 
03:08:09.309 --> 03:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
needs and provides greater help to make
 
03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure that those children don't fall
 
03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
through an opportunity yeah the other
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
choice would be to take State money and
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
divide it among communities on a
 
03:08:26.349 --> 03:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
uniform per pupil basis take pce base a
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
and say on a per pupil basis give the
 
03:08:33.309 --> 03:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
same amount of money to communities that
 
03:08:36.030 --> 03:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
are wealthier and have fewer challenges
 
03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
as they would give as the state would
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
give to communities that have special
 
03:08:48.670 --> 03:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
needs how does that uniform pay for rule
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
as a matter of
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
policy protect our students with the
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
greatest challenges it doesn't it
 
03:09:00.750 --> 03:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't if you have to choose between
 
03:09:03.630 --> 03:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
one that focuses Aid to help the
 
03:09:06.030 --> 03:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
communities with the greatest need say
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
like Manchester students learning
 
03:09:11.229 --> 03:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
English is a second language conquered
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
we uh the chain in our student
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
demographics since when my kids were
 
03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
here is amazing with students new
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
Americans who are learning English as a
 
03:09:24.910 --> 03:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
second language conquered faces greater
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
challenges than other communities it
 
03:09:31.229 --> 03:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
should receive greater finance and
 
03:09:33.710 --> 03:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
resource support this is just a basic
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
rule a rule that says no everybody gets
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
every District gets the same amount
 
03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of the need and the challenge
 
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
that they face to make sure their
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
children have a fair shot at a decent
 
03:09:51.870 --> 03:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
education doesn't make sense 1586
 
03:09:54.510 --> 03:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
changed this it's interesting I my first
 
03:09:57.790 --> 03:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
experience with this was when I was in
 
03:10:00.910 --> 03:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
college UNH elected to represent the
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
town of Cornish and cin uh in this
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislature I served on the ways of
 
03:10:08.070 --> 03:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
Means Committee but in cin they had a
 
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
family that had two children that uh had
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
very special needs
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it was crippling challenge for the
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
town of c and at that time I was
 
03:10:23.469 --> 03:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
advocating the state support and whole
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
system comprehensive system must provide
 
03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
greater support to the communities with
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
the greatest
 
03:10:36.830 --> 03:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
need I don't hear from leaders in the
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
litigation like attorney valinsky or
 
03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
litigation like attorney valinsky or
attorney

03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
Tobin a fundamental disagreement with
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
the equity uh student Equity point that
 
03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'm making it is a different point that
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
they're focused on they're saying that
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
the Court Supreme Court has issued a
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
rule that is kind of this bright line
 
03:11:01.710 --> 03:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
rule that says you got to give the same
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
amount per pupil across the entire state
 
03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
in base Aid above that you can change it
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
but it's got to be a highly costed
 
03:11:15.429 --> 03:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
amount and it's got to be split base uh
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
on a uniform for pupil basis I think
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's where I disagree I don't think
 
03:11:24.910 --> 03:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
that this court has faced as
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative am said an integrated
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive system of funding and
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
spending like presented in House Bill
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
1586 the commission worked on for a year
 
03:11:39.150 --> 03:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
to develop I don't think they faced it
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
yet and I don't think they faced an
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
argument about the consequences Mr
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
chairman as I'm closing I'd like to
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
distribute a simple chart that um shows
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
how every state in the uh country is
 
03:11:58.269 --> 03:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
divided between
 
03:12:01.950 --> 03:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
local uh state and federal dollars from
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
the most recent us sentence 2021 sure
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
may I distribute yes yeah we'll just
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
hand it right to represent Bel and
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
they'll pass them around
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:17.510 align:start position:0%
they'll pass them around
cop

03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I'll close with this because I know
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot your committee your
 
03:12:22.110 --> 03:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
working committee is going to do a lot
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
of work on this and I and I look forward
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
to participating to the extent I'm
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to what this uh graphic shows
 
03:12:34.030 --> 03:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's coming around what this chart
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
shows is based on US Census Data for
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
2021 how every State's total financing
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
of their Public Schools is divided
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
between State revenues as a percentage
 
03:12:51.229 --> 03:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
local revenues as a percentage Federal
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
revenues as a percentage all totaling
 
03:12:58.269 --> 03:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
100% what it shows is that New Hampshire
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
is one of the lowest States is not
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
counting District of Columbia the lowest
 
03:13:10.110 --> 03:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
state in terms of um State percentage
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
support for the total cost of public
 
03:13:16.830 --> 03:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
education it shows in contrast
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden for your work on
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
the commission I I just it shows in
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
contrast that
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is at uh a little higher
 
03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:29.790 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is at uh a little higher
at

03:13:29.790 --> 03:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
41.2% uh State contribution the local
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
contribution is
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
53% and the federal uh uh contribution
 
03:13:40.399 --> 03:13:41.550 align:start position:0%
53% and the federal uh uh contribution
is

03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:43.790 align:start position:0%
is
5.8%

03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
5.8%
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
it shows that Connecticut is
 
03:13:51.429 --> 03:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
36.4% state New York
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
37.8% Pennsylvania
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
37.4% New Jersey
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
43.9% Rhode Island
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
40.4% and New Hampshire as I mentioned
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.510 --> 03:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
30.9% um if New Hampshire were to adopt
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1586
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
the original Finance work that the
 
03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
commission did would see that the state
 
03:14:22.269 --> 03:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
contribution would over time increase to
 
03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
close to 40% of the total which would
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
put it in line with Massachusetts what
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'd mention is that the states I've just
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
called out the the the uh the New
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
England states also are the states with
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the highest quality rankings for their
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
Public School schools New Hampshire is
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
third in education weeks quality ranking
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
the two above it are Massachusetts and
 
03:14:56.910 --> 03:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
New Jersey these uh these states have
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
some of the lowest state budget
 
03:15:04.269 --> 03:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
contributions and they have a strong
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
participation from the local governments
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and local control consistent with the
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
history of New England's commitment to
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
public education I would say that the
 
03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
policy job for this legislature is to
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
say what's the right number what's the
 
03:15:25.189 --> 03:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
right percentage but as you do it you
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
need to also make sure that the money
 
03:15:31.830 --> 03:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
the state money that's put into this is
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
distributed on a basis that helps make
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
sure helps in the words of Claremont 1
 
03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:38.590 align:start position:0%
sure helps in the words of Claremont 1
to

03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee that every child in this state
 
03:15:45.309 --> 03:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
has access to a high quality education
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live and so
 
03:15:50.469 --> 03:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
where the greatest challenges are you
 
03:15:52.990 --> 03:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't forget them under
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
1586 the plaintiff towns for Claremont
 
03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
do substantially better than they would
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
under a similarly a uniform based per
 
03:16:09.630 --> 03:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
pupil distribution that's important for
 
03:16:11.750 --> 03:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
those of us and there are a lot of us
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
who care about the communities with the
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
greatest need thank you thank you very
 
03:16:19.469 --> 03:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
much Mr aringer so am I correct then
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to take away from your
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
conversation here that we have a
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
distribution problem yes the uh report
 
03:16:32.189 --> 03:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh for the commission uh concluded that
 
03:16:35.429 --> 03:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
our current distribution of Education
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
resources regardless of where the funds
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
are from local and state total is
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
regressive and that the way to correct
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
it the distribution is to make sure that
 
03:16:51.870 --> 03:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
the communities with the greatest need
 
03:16:54.750 --> 03:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
get the share they need to give their
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
children a fair
 
03:16:59.710 --> 03:16:59.720 align:start position:0%

03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
onwards
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay got it and the the amendment
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
there is on line 33 beginning July 1 of
 
03:19:33.870 --> 03:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
2025 um and that the the Dr would
 
03:19:35.790 --> 03:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
calculate the uh the rate to generate
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
the revenue of $363
 
03:19:43.469 --> 03:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
million so um that change
 
03:19:46.630 --> 03:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
sort of disregards the uh the how about
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal year beginning July one
 
03:19:52.830 --> 03:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
of 2024 um so that potentially could be
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
an issue but the Dr assumes that we
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
would still continue to be calculating
 
03:20:00.309 --> 03:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
um the the rate for the 363 million for
 
03:20:02.309 --> 03:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 202 U fiscal year
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
beginning July 1 24 um so just wanted to
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
highlight this that potentially um you
 
03:20:10.590 --> 03:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
know some additional language needs to
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
be made to to
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
to include the uh the uh July 1
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
2024 um fiscal beginning text year
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
year the other item that that we sort of
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
bill section 18 is on page 16 yeah right
 
03:20:54.030 --> 03:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:57.550 --> 03:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
Y in this section uh we suggest that
 
03:21:00.269 --> 03:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
potentially additional language uh to be
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
included to coincide with the amendment
 
03:21:05.189 --> 03:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
to a taxable period because the uh the
 
03:21:06.910 --> 03:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
property tax year taxable period starts
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
with April
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
1 um so that would that would avoid any
 
03:21:18.030 --> 03:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the other item of note is in the
 
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
low and motor program and that would be
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.510 --> 03:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
17 so in the uh in the calculation here
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
we noted that uh
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the determination of household
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
income brackets uh for the applicable
 
03:21:50.429 --> 03:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
percentage to determine the amount of
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
low motor relief available for both
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
single and household or or married for
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
or married persons uh there is a gap
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
that happens there uh for the income
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
level qualifying for the 100% claim and
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
where the phase out begins so in in in
 
03:22:11.469 --> 03:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
my handout I provide a uh an example of
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
that where that Gap occurs so uh during
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh the committee committee's review U
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
committee should have a look at that
 
03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
just to determine to make sure that the
 
03:22:29.790 --> 03:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.910 --> 03:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
corrected and finally uh this is also in
 
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
the in the low moderate uh piece where
 
03:22:39.309 --> 03:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
there is a uh current proposal to have
 
03:22:41.830 --> 03:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the limitation of total limitation pay P
 
03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
out of 25 million per talking about the
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
exception here excuse me you're talking
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
about the exception for low and moderate
 
03:22:50.269 --> 03:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh not not the exception but the the the
 
03:22:53.469 --> 03:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
maximum payout the $25 million payout
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um so we think that there
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
potentially a timing issue right now um
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
the Dr processes the uh the payout
 
03:23:06.670 --> 03:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
within 120 days of of receiving the uh
 
03:23:09.189 --> 03:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
the application for the
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
relief so in terms of trying to to limit
 
03:23:14.550 --> 03:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
the payout to $25 million per fiscal
 
03:23:17.189 --> 03:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
year uh we need to receive
 
03:23:20.269 --> 03:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
all applications before we can issue any
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
payout um and there is language in the
 
03:23:28.110 --> 03:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
statute to allow for um late submissions
 
03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.269 --> 03:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
30th okay so the DI would uh suggest the
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh that the committee review this
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
section uh one more time to make sure
 
03:23:42.750 --> 03:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
that um that if they intention is to
 
03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
have that limitation of $25 million per
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then how is that going
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
to pay out play out with the timing of
 
03:23:52.189 --> 03:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
receiving all the applications uh be it
 
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh Within by June 30th or with the
 
03:23:57.950 --> 03:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
extended deadline and uh and the payment
 
03:24:01.950 --> 03:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
of that uh of the relief
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay and that's all I
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
have are you going to be around another
 
03:24:08.830 --> 03:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
question are you going to be around that
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
you we as a subcommittee working on this
 
03:24:13.229 --> 03:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
if we have some issues with this portion
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
of the bill that you would be available
 
03:24:18.550 --> 03:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
I I will be here as well as uh um we
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
have we would have uh expert oh well um
 
03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
a person who's more knowledgeable with
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh with the tax rate calculations um
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
with us as well okay yes I've been in
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%

you are there any questions for the
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you very much appreciate
 
03:25:03.550 --> 03:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
it um we do have still several
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
cards I know we're getting close to
 
03:25:07.950 --> 03:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
launch here and we'll finish up quickly
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
leam there you go okay now I'm good all
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
right um I'm Natalie llam I'm one of the
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys for the rans suit resident of
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
bosin native of Berlin I was not one of
 
03:25:33.150 --> 03:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
the attorneys on Claremont believe it or
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
not I was barely alive um which I think
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
shows how long this has been happening
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I did just want to Circle back about
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
kind of our concerns with the
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution ity of the bill again I was
 
03:25:46.229 --> 03:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
not on Claremont so this is not just a a
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
point of Pride or some emotional
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
connection I have with those decisions
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're just really important to keep in
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
mind and make sure that any laws you
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
pass follow those and first as attorney
 
03:26:00.110 --> 03:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
binsky said it's really good law like if
 
03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
you look all the education funding
 
03:26:04.189 --> 03:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
across the state the language in our
 
03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the way it's been
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the court is really
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
really good like other educational
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates are jealous of us so I just
 
03:26:15.030 --> 03:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's a shame to kind of brush that aside
 
03:26:17.189 --> 03:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
with some other kind of uh approach to
 
03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
it and second the reason that's so
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
important that it's good language is it
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
offers protection this is a
 
03:26:25.389 --> 03:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional right it's the state's
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund entirely Fund in
 
03:26:30.670 --> 03:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
adequate Education First and Last Dollar
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
if you kind of dilute that principle or
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
push it aside there's there's no
 
03:26:37.349 --> 03:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
protection anymore and sure you might
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
send some targeted a this year next
 
03:26:41.189 --> 03:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
budget cycle maybe you've changed your
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
mind mind and you're not going to now
 
03:26:46.030 --> 03:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
and if you've somehow taken away the
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
concept the principle that it's the
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
state's obligation to fund everything
 
03:26:53.950 --> 03:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
you've just thrown that away and maybe
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
that right's not coming back so um and
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
same thing with if you don't follow the
 
03:27:01.710 --> 03:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
principle that the legislature needs to
 
03:27:04.030 --> 03:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
Define what an adequate education is
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
you're leaving that open who's going to
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
do that the Department of Education
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
maybe are they going to change next year
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
and have a completely different Outlook
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
just giving a lot there's a lot of
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
opening there for constitutional rights
 
03:27:20.990 --> 03:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
to be really violated here and um just
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
to also we disagree very strongly with
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
attorney ardinger um interpretation that
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
Claremont and that approach says the
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
funding has to be the same everywhere
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
and you can't Target or vary it that
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
does not say that it says that whatever
 
03:27:38.469 --> 03:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
the state defines his adequacy it must
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
fund which is where we come in with this
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
first and last all everything of
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy is the state's responsibility
 
03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean adequacy is the same
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere if you're a place with a lot
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
of low-income students I'm thinking of
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
Berlin it's probably half free and
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch students you have
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
more needs than another town where no
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
one's in poverty same thing if you have
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of English language Learners the
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
cost of adequacy for your District or if
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of special needs students
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
is higher than another District the
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
state still has to fund it but it
 
03:28:10.469 --> 03:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the same you can
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
Target Aid and you should but if you're
 
03:28:15.189 --> 03:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
going to Target Aid you should still be
 
03:28:17.189 --> 03:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
meeting the whole constitutional
 
03:28:19.070 --> 03:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
obligation of Claremont and londondary
 
03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
that you are funding all of adequacy
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's said I'll take any questions if
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
there are thank you very much are there
 
03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:26.030 align:start position:0%
there are thank you very much are there
any

03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Miler and thank
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for being here so
 
03:28:34.670 --> 03:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have you go back and your
 
03:28:36.429 --> 03:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
last statement that you said about
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
targeting Aid um because one of the
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
issues we have is that current ly it's
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
one siiz fits all you know currently
 
03:28:47.510 --> 03:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
$4,100 everybody gets the same with the
 
03:28:49.870 --> 03:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
exception of free and reduced Etc but
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the basic Aid is one siiz fits-all uh is
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
it your testimony that within the
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
construct that you're talking about that
 
03:29:01.269 --> 03:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
some school districts can in fact
 
03:29:04.750 --> 03:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
receive more Aid than others based upon
 
03:29:06.830 --> 03:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
the demographics of that particular
 
03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:10.110 align:start position:0%
the demographics of that particular
School

03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
District yes I think you're asking can
 
03:29:15.469 --> 03:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
the formula vary based on different
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
demographics with how much Aid they
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
receive so in addition to differentiated
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
Aid is that what you're asking I'm I'm
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm talking about just basic state
 
03:29:29.189 --> 03:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
aid can can districts receive on that
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
basic state aid different funding based
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
upon the demographics sociometrics
 
03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it of that
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
school district so that those districts
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
that have greater need in fact can get
 
03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding ra above and beyond
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
the basic identified funding adequacy
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
they could yes there's no reason why
 
03:29:53.150 --> 03:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
they couldn't I think the way the
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
legislature currently does it with the
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
base Aid and the specific differentiated
 
03:29:59.309 --> 03:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
Aid categories per student is one way to
 
03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
do it you could add on other
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
differentials looking at the
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
demographics or some other
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
characteristic of the district that
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
increases its needs and fund it that way
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
that could be part of the formula
 
03:30:13.469 --> 03:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
there's no reason it couldn't be thank
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions not hearing it we have one
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
shean All right so I'm the last one
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch so I will be quick
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh Zach Sheen School bill that has not
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
gotten as much attention that I wanted
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
to just highlight because I think that
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
it is a critical element of the bill um
 
03:30:39.790 --> 03:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's the low and moderate property tax
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
relief program um that is dramatically
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
expanded in this um legislation so I
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight on that single
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
piece um of uh what is you know a pretty
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
large Bill touching a lot of different
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
areas um so this legislation um both
 
03:30:59.790 --> 03:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
reform swept in the sense that Statewide
 
03:31:01.389 --> 03:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
education property tax money would then
 
03:31:04.030 --> 03:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
go to the state and in part then
 
03:31:07.030 --> 03:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
dramatically expands the ability of
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
people to access what is a currently
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
existing program the low and moderate
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program we currently
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
have that running in New Hampshire the
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
problem is that the um cut offs to apply
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
for and be eligible for it are so low
 
03:31:24.550 --> 03:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
that so few people actually apply and
 
03:31:26.830 --> 03:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
those that are are eligible and those
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
that are eligible that do apply get so
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
little relief that it's barely worth
 
03:31:33.389 --> 03:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
their time um just in the past um year
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
the amount given out in property tax
 
03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
relief was about $1.4
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
million might seem like a um well it's
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
not a it's not not a lot compared to the
 
03:31:45.790 --> 03:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money actually um people are
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
actually paying property taxes that came
 
03:31:49.150 --> 03:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
to about
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
$250 per claim on average I don't know
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
how many people in the state are paying
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
property tax bills that are only $250
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't imagine very many and so
 
03:32:00.309 --> 03:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
what this program would do would expand
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
those limits so that more people would
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
be eligible to be more in line with
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
current property values inflation the
 
03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
amount of money people actually need in
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
that property tax relief uh and it's a
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
really critical part of this bill as
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the heavy Reliance
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
on property taxes to fund our Public
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
Schools this would help make more people
 
03:32:24.750 --> 03:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
have access to that property tax relief
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and one other piece on that there's a
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
question earlier about um is this bill
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
mandating property tax relief uh no my
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is is it is expanding the
 
03:32:38.110 --> 03:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility so more people can apply for
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
it and if they do apply then the bill
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
lays out how you would calculate um the
 
03:32:44.590 --> 03:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
the benefits that they would get for
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
that property tax relief um and then the
 
03:32:51.189 --> 03:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
last piece is I just want to um urge the
 
03:32:52.269 --> 03:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh committee members and the
 
03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members sitting the
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
audience um to approach all of these
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
bills with not a uh not as a mutually
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
exclusive approach so not one bill at
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
the detriment of others or one approach
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
at the detriment of others all the bills
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard so far today have pieces
 
03:33:10.830 --> 03:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
that would benefit could benefit um both
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
both property taxpayers and students in
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you have the ability
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
to amend them combine them tweak them
 
03:33:18.990 --> 03:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
put work into them to make sure they are
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
working in the ways that would most
 
03:33:23.469 --> 03:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
benefit you know the communities and
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
school districts that have the highest
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
need so I just would really encourage
 
03:33:27.189 --> 03:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
you all to do that and be happy to
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee not see any thank you very
 
03:33:35.750 --> 03:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
much Zach with that I'm going to close
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing on 1686 and we'll come back
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
in a half hour to start start up the
 
03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:50.710 align:start position:0%
in a half hour to start start up the
next

03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:57.550 --> 03:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:00.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:34:00.189 --> 03:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:00.199 --> 03:34:08.630 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah there is
 
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it is there's a lot of they can go
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
into the thinking process and how we go
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
directions but I think we were
 
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
discussing and things s of the latter
 
03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
part here well you know since your bill
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:56:07.710 align:start position:0%
 
more

04:10:04.670 --> 04:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
38
 
04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
um this bill I want to start with say
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
is not intended to take any money away
 
04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
from anybody I don't want anybody to
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
lose any money because of this bill what
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
I want is for our students to become
 
04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
proficient what I want is to incentivize
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
schools to focus on reading and writing
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
and math in the younger grades the tools
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they are going to need to be
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
successful in the older grades the tools
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
that they are going to need to be
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
successful in
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
life I'm not asking teachers to work any
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
harder than they are I'm asking teachers
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
to work differently than they are I'm
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
asking school
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
systems to change their
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
priorities um to not spend so much
 
04:10:58.560 --> 04:11:01.109 align:start position:0%
priorities um to not spend so much
time

04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
on things like Dei and more time on
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
things like reading
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm asking schools to
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
not use methods which are
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
ineffective I'm asking for schools to
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
use reading methods as were represented
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
by um Vice chair
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli so not 3 queing which is
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
basically educated guessing which
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's been lots of evidence is not
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
only um ineffective but actually harmful
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
to a student's ability to learn how to
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
read I'm asking schools to actually
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
memorizing the
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
math uh multiplication tables as opposed
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
to just using
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
calculators because if you see the
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
results the proficiency
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
scores they might start out at 72 in the
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
lower grades but as they move up by the
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
time they get to 8th grade they're 39 39
 
04:12:11.319 --> 04:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
time they get to 8th grade they're 39 39
students

04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
are proficient in
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
math and the thing is at that point you
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
really need to know your math facts you
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
can't reduce your fractions you can't
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
Factor equations you can't do any of
 
04:12:31.229 --> 04:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
that stuff if you don't just know cold
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
and believe me I know how hard that can
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
be for me that was a very difficult
 
04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
thing we did a lot lot of flashcards
 
04:12:40.750 --> 04:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
around the dinner table my brothers all
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
knew their math facts before I did it
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
was hard for me to memorize it's still
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
memorize but I had to learn them in
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
order to do the rest of the math and I
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
became a math major eventually that is
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
mathematics I tried a couple years ago
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
to incentivize schools to to improve by
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
giving extra money right by giving
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
awards for improvement and
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency and that got turned
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
down I tried last year using the
 
04:13:23.229 --> 04:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
accountability that was in this bill
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
that we just looked at nobody even
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it um somebody's
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
phone or buzzer or something is going
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
off it's okay go
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
so this time so I tried the carrot I
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
tried something neutral so I'm trying
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
what you might call this the stick but I
 
04:13:51.309 --> 04:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody to have to use that
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
stick I want them to say oh we might
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
lose our funding somewhere down the road
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
and I do have this um phase in over a
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
long period of time you get a number of
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
years just to bring your population up
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then slowly this will phase in in
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
the hopes that nobody will ever fall
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
into this and I have given an exception
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
for all of those students with special
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
needs and as long as they're getting the
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
to we have about half of our students
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
who are not proficient
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
in language arts half of our students
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
can't even make the level three like
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
halfway half of our students only 20% of
 
04:14:51.149 --> 04:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
our students are special needs students
 
04:14:53.309 --> 04:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
so what's happening with the other
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
30% why are we
 
04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
not um doing whatever is necessary to
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
make them proficient because I think
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that reading and Ma well language arts
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
and math are the most important thing
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
everything else you learn hinges on it
 
04:15:11.680 --> 04:15:12.670 align:start position:0%
everything else you learn hinges on it
everything

04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
else and you can use all those subjects
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying don't teach anything else
 
04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
but do it with a focus on those things
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
for instance when you're doing social
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
studies focus on reading focus on
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
writing papers and focus on doing it
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
correctly with good grammar with you
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
know good spelling with good sentence
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:38.429 align:start position:0%
know good spelling with good sentence
structure

04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
structure
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
when doing music you can use counting
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
and fractions I mean what's a quarter
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
note right what's a 64th note those are
 
04:15:52.030 --> 04:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
all things and how do you divide up that
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
measure into those parts into that
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
fraction that's right at the beginning
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the musical line three four
 
04:15:59.760 --> 04:16:02.469 align:start position:0%
of the musical line three four
time

04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
so these things can be implemented in
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
everything and I'm I'm asking for people
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
to put a focus on it so that kids can
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
accomplish it and I it only goes up to
 
04:16:17.670 --> 04:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
8th grade by then if you have kids
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
proficient all the rest will be so much
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
easier because all the rest uses those
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
things and doesn't start till the end of
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
third grade because kids develop reading
 
04:16:30.439 --> 04:16:32.189 align:start position:0%
third grade because kids develop reading
kids

04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
brains uh mature at different rates but
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
generally by the end of third
 
04:16:37.840 --> 04:16:39.510 align:start position:0%
generally by the end of third
grade

04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
grade
 
04:16:42.870 --> 04:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
most kids who can have pretty much
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
um and if we do proper screening Etc
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
starting from the beginning for both
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
reading and math do you have you know
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
issues understanding numbers Etc and we
 
04:17:04.269 --> 04:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
start getting them help from the
 
04:17:06.429 --> 04:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
beginning because we know that by the
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.910 --> 04:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
accountable we may be able to find those
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
children who have problems and do the
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
proper give them the proper um Aid that
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
they need to become proficient because
 
04:17:27.109 --> 04:17:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's what school is
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
about I
 
04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
mean really the fact that we have half
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
of our kids aren't proficient in reading
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
and more than half of our kids aren't
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
proficient in math and yet we brag that
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
oh we're our state's one of the best in
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
the country well our country is not one
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
of the best in the world and we really
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for us not to be we're
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
well down the list compared to other
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
countries and that's sad so let's put a
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
focus where a focus belongs and get our
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
kids to be
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
proficient cuz I personally cannot think
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
of a reason why if a kid had does not
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a learning
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
disability and we are focusing on it why
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
every kid can't be at least
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
proficient in language arts and math
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you very much for
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward um a couple of
 
04:18:33.080 --> 04:18:34.590 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward um a couple of
questions

04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
um um and in section 3A lines uh 6
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
through 10 pretty much
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
um uh you're basing things on the number
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
of uh students found proficient in
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
grades 3 through eight um is that the
 
04:18:54.189 --> 04:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
number of students in
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
either English language arts or math
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
being proficient or do they have to be
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
proficient in both in the beginning when
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
you're only doing partial uh reduction
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's it is both but by the time you get
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the 100% it's either you get 50% for
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
one and 50% for the
 
04:19:19.630 --> 04:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
other for the
 
04:19:21.790 --> 04:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'll repr some that because I
 
04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:23.119 align:start position:0%
have one
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
um where that proficiency bar is set is
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
kind of uh up to whether the you know
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
the the agency the the testing agency or
 
04:19:35.070 --> 04:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
or or or even the department or
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes proficiencies Rock by botom um
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did in the state a
 
04:19:44.309 --> 04:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
while back was we are measuring growth
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
of students not necessarily whether they
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
hit the
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
bar but if a student comes in and for
 
04:19:54.990 --> 04:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever reason there might be huge
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
issues at home and learning is just not
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
a priority survival is
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
priority but we're seeing some
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
growth if you want to use percent Iles
 
04:20:10.030 --> 04:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
or you know nce scores or you know
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
growth scale scores any of that stuff if
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
they're showing growth why wouldn't that
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
suffice for proficient or in our
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment now we
 
04:20:22.990 --> 04:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
say academic proficiency and growth is
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we're measuring kids well growth is
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
what you're going to have time to find
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
and if you have a brand new kid you have
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
two years to try to bring them up to
 
04:20:32.159 --> 04:20:34.590 align:start position:0%
two years to try to bring them up to
proficient

04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
proficient
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
um but why is is because growth from
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
very little slow growth eventually
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to graduate they're still
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be
 
04:20:48.030 --> 04:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
there and yeah they may have a terrible
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
home environment but one of the things
 
04:20:54.429 --> 04:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
you can do is have after school programs
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
work with those kids individually I
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
certainly did a lot of that as a teacher
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
with kids who had problems and came from
 
04:21:01.159 --> 04:21:02.309 align:start position:0%
with kids who had problems and came from
trouble

04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
backgrounds um to get my kids to be
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
backgrounds um to get my kids to be
proficient

04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
proficient
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I think and I've seen it done with
 
04:21:09.720 --> 04:21:10.710 align:start position:0%
and I think and I've seen it done with
my

04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
granddaughter and um who came from a
 
04:21:14.080 --> 04:21:15.469 align:start position:0%
granddaughter and um who came from a
difficult

04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
situation and yet they had after
 
04:21:22.349 --> 04:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
school and she thrived that helped her a
 
04:21:26.349 --> 04:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
lot so we're giving schools money for
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
these kids who are coming from those
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
backgrounds we give that bump up right
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
that extra adequacy for that well what
 
04:21:36.510 --> 04:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
is it being used for I think that's one
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that can be used for
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
working with those kids individually
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
having time after school I think if
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
we're focused on this then we will use
 
04:21:48.990 --> 04:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
that money more
 
04:21:50.670 --> 04:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately are there further
 
04:21:52.590 --> 04:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair so I think I
 
04:21:58.349 --> 04:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
need a clarification and then I also
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:22:02.710 --> 04:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
question if I understand the bill draft
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:22:08.349 --> 04:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
remarks in fiscal year TW or Academic
 
04:22:08.359 --> 04:22:10.030 align:start position:0%
remarks in fiscal year TW or Academic
Year

04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
Year
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
26 if 50% of the students at a say third
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
grade at whatever grade level were not
 
04:22:19.109 --> 04:22:19.119 align:start position:0%
proficient in
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
math then that school would get 26% less
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
funding for that 50% of kids for half
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
their kids am
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
50% were not proficient
 
04:22:43.000 --> 04:22:44.830 align:start position:0%
50% were not proficient
mhm

04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
mhm
 
04:22:44.840 --> 04:22:46.790 align:start position:0%
mhm
then

04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:22:46.800 --> 04:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
then
25

04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
30 it would be they would get
 
04:23:02.309 --> 04:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
75% of that 50% 25% less per child right
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
for that for those that 50% that wasn't
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
for that for those that 50% that wasn't
proficient

04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
proficient
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
so the overall decrease in
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
funding is about 12 a half
 
04:23:12.159 --> 04:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
funding is about 12 a half
per.

04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
per.
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah may I continue go ahead thank
 
04:23:21.790 --> 04:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
you and then I believe in your response
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
a moment ago to a
 
04:23:27.550 --> 04:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
question you were suggesting that these
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
children could be helped by more
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
intensive individual after school
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
programs prior to that
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
point so how
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
fing the after school programs starting
 
04:23:40.479 --> 04:23:41.630 align:start position:0%
fing the after school programs starting
this

04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
year starting this year the money the
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
extra money that is given what extra
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
money are we talking about the money for
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of free and reduced lunch
 
04:23:57.790 --> 04:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
the money that we give for districts
 
04:24:02.670 --> 04:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
adjusted property values Etc all that
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
money that we give now that that I
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
called are you talking about a part of
 
04:24:18.030 --> 04:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
the adequacy for yeah we have the base
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
level and then differentiated thank you
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
all the differentiate all of that that's
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
what the this is what that should be
 
04:24:25.520 --> 04:24:27.030 align:start position:0%
what the this is what that should be
applied

04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
applied
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
to helping those kids who come from
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
those backgrounds to be successful I
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to see them just written off
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
well they're getting better well you
 
04:24:42.189 --> 04:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
know they just come from a bad
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
background that's the point of public
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
education is to get those kids up but
 
04:24:49.109 --> 04:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
that means we need to be using the extra
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
money that we're giving for those kids
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
kids represent Hall thank chair thank
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions so what is
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
that money in your opinion what is that
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
money being spent on right now the ones
 
04:25:10.710 --> 04:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
for the free that's a good question
 
04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
nobody ever lets us know do you have no
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
idea I have no idea no I do not it gets
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
put into the general fund it gets spent
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
um the schol clarify for you it goes
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
into the operational fund yes if it's
 
04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
differentiated or base adequacy it's not
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
targeted money right that's what I mean
 
04:25:40.229 --> 04:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so but they can Target it the
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
school decides how that money gets spent
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
right that would have to be a local
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
decision exactly so this is to
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
incentivize the locals to decide to
 
04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
spend that money for the kids who are
 
04:25:52.760 --> 04:25:56.510 align:start position:0%
spend that money for the kids who are
not

04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
proficient my my my followup to where
 
04:26:01.870 --> 04:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
you are rep statement then is this a
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that they do this no it's up
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
kids and you may say yeah they're trying
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
now but there's an awful lot of stuff
 
04:26:16.229 --> 04:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's going on in schools that is not
 
04:26:19.149 --> 04:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
trying to teach those subjects to kids
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of time that's
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
spent on other things and I would like
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
to see that time spent on that I I
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me I would like an example of
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
what they're spending their money on
 
04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
that isn't targeted towards kids
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
learning to read and do math the
 
04:26:37.950 --> 04:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
question not to me that's a question
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
what are they spending their money on
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're spending money on learning how
 
04:26:44.189 --> 04:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
they're privileged no that's not
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
happening that is not happening no okay
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're not this is not the debate
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
Club folks we're here to hear what's
 
04:26:54.189 --> 04:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
going on in front of us
 
04:26:56.830 --> 04:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
here are there any other questions for
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
represent leus yes representa Hall so
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me ask my question
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so you
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
said you don't know what they're
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
spending money on on the differentiated
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
Aid yet now you're saying you do know
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
because it's the wrong thing yes or
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
no what I
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
know is that there is time being spent
 
04:27:18.760 --> 04:27:19.950 align:start position:0%
know is that there is time being spent
in

04:27:19.950 --> 04:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
classrooms on things that don't have to
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
do with learning to read and write and
 
04:27:26.319 --> 04:27:29.469 align:start position:0%
do with learning to read and write and
do

04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
math I know that there are things spent
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
on seal and Dei and very ious other
 
04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:38.830 align:start position:0%
on seal and Dei and very ious other
things

04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
that some of which is useful a small
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
amount is useful but I have heard from
 
04:27:48.189 --> 04:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
teachers complaining about the amount of
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
time that they spend
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
teaching um seal stuff and devoting
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
chunks of the morning just on that that
 
04:28:02.830 --> 04:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
they F feel that they could spend
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
teaching kids I mean I've looked at some
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the classroom schedules of elementary
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
school teachers and huge chunks in the
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
morning spent on seal
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
stuff and they complain about that they
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
say I have to do this this is not all
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
school districts this it varies School
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
District to school district but the
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time that they're spending in
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
the morning and they have to
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
record how the student is doing how
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
their day was the day before all kinds
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
of stuff so one of them that I saw was
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half an hour and a half
 
04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
every morning was in that schedule tell
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
me an hour and a half you couldn't have
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
yes inviting the kids finding out where
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
they're at I always did that I did that
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
even when I subbed and I had one subject
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
I did that with kids I didn't even know
 
04:28:59.870 --> 04:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
you got to do that but an hour and a
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
half that's the kind of
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
stuff yes we have to have you know this
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
one's supposedly done right now but that
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're hearing so just the followup so
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
if they got this money you think they
 
04:29:15.070 --> 04:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
would take out all that fluff that you
 
04:29:17.070 --> 04:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
don't like do you think that that's that
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
would incentivize them to not do the
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
seal and the I that is my hope that the
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
fear of losing the money will cause them
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
because people do work on incentives and
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen it before when the state or
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government made um said they
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
would take funding or whatever for
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
certain things people changed their
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
behavior we see it that's the way that
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
people do that so yes my hope is that
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
none of this money will ever be taken
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
away I don't want to see the money taken
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
away what I hope is that schools will go
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
back and
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate how they're spending their
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
time and see if there's some way they
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
can spend their time more efficiently
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we got lots of
 
04:30:10.750 --> 04:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
cards okay are there any further
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
question we do have more cards on this
 
04:30:13.119 --> 04:30:14.469 align:start position:0%
question we do have more cards on this
particular

04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
Bill no you've been Russ and belch you
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
asked questions before no no no go
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:30:27.870 --> 04:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
rep leus for bringing us forward um so
 
04:30:29.469 --> 04:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
the the idea of incentives was brought
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
up and the concern about if a school
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
were to lose this funding how then would
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
they recover
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and be able to teach these students
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
which I think is a fair question but
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
let's let's look at the other side of
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
that as well and I want to ask you given
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have traditionally been
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
not taking away money for incentive
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
based items and that funding has
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
continued to increase anyway our schools
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
right now succeeding based on our
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
current model of paying more
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
money regardless of outcomes or are we
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
currently in a situation where we're
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
failing under this
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
model um we have been given more giving
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
more money since
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
1970 we've had decrease in population
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
and more per pupil spending every year
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
and yet our outcomes have remained
 
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
basically stable and actually they
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
changed the evaluation at one point you
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
can see they started to go down and
 
04:31:28.510 --> 04:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
right about then they changed the
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
evaluation methods and then they were
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
stable again so clearly throwing more
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
money throwing more money throwing more
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
money is not bringing about the effects
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
want so I'm just trying to use the
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
incentive system to try to get people to
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
think about how else can we do this what
 
04:31:54.149 --> 04:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
else can we do what will be more
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
efficient what will be more effective
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's all it's just to incentivize I
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
tried other means nobody wanted them I'm
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
trying this one probably nobody will
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
want this one either but I want people
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
to start thinking is there a way
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
throwing more money and more money and
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
more money is not working what else
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
might work what could we do how could we
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
use our time how could we use the
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
resources we have to be more efficient
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
at doing the fundamental task of Reading
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
Writing and arithmetic on which
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
everything else is built because if you
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
can do that in today's day and age with
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
the inter internet and everything you
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
can teach yourself anything else you
 
04:32:39.149 --> 04:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:32:41.790 --> 04:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
learn are there further
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions R's name Damon please quick
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would like to ask
 
04:32:50.590 --> 04:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
the representative to bring us before or
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
at our executive session on this bill
 
04:32:53.399 --> 04:32:56.109 align:start position:0%
at our executive session on this bill
specific

04:32:56.109 --> 04:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
documentation by school
 
04:33:03.109 --> 04:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
classroom where is the evidence of it's
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
got to be a question asking her if she
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
would please bring us specific
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
information do that in as side because
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's not a question okay I'll try to
 
04:33:15.750 --> 04:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
get whatever I can unfortunately I have
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
a problem with teachers being afraid of
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
being um penalized for speaking against
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
the system so I'll see what I can do are
 
04:33:26.109 --> 04:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
there any further questions of represent
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
leus thank you very much we will go to
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
the next person I have on 1675 Doug
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:34:00.349 align:start position:0%
the next person I have on 1675 Doug
Hall

04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I um Doug Hall I'm
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
here representing myself but uh I don't
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
know many of you so I've put in here a
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
little of my background I I chaired
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
house Finance subcommittee on school
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
funding back in the augenblick years
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
before the Claremont du decision um and
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
I was responsible for making sure that
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
we were trying to comply with that
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
formula which we never
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
did um as the founder of the New
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Center for Public Policy
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
studies and in that role U authored many
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
reports on student achievement in this
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
State um
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we did was bring
 
04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
attention to the dropout rate in New
 
04:34:46.590 --> 04:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which at that time uh 20 years
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
ago was
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
25% of the students were not completing
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
high school as a result of that work
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
that we did analyzing that a few years
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
later the the age at which students
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
could leave high school was increased by
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
this legislature from 16 to 18 and it's
 
04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
reduced the dropout rate so I've been
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
involved in this for some time and I was
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
in I helped uh this
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislature pass the law that set up for
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
the first time a student database in
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
this state which is what's used to
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
record student achievement right now I
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I I support the
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
sponsors goals on this bill her the
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
goals are are laudable we need to make
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
sure that all the students in the state
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
are achieving at a proficient level now
 
04:35:45.629 --> 04:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
I'll make a comment about proficiency
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
but we do need to pay attention and make
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
sure that students
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
are um learning their math and their
 
04:35:56.189 --> 04:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
reading and and
 
04:35:59.470 --> 04:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
writing however I strongly oppose this
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill it does exactly the wrong thing to
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
achieve that goal first
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
um we know that uh student achievement
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
no matter how you measure it is very
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
highly correlated with parents education
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
and family
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
income now those are not perfect proxies
 
04:36:29.869 --> 04:36:29.879 align:start position:0%
but the real correlation is to parents
 
04:36:32.349 --> 04:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
commitment to their own education and
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
their children's
 
04:36:36.189 --> 04:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
education we we don't have a measure of
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
that but we can use these other two
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
parental income
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
um of being one that we essentially have
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
through free and reduced lunch now the
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
reason I wanted to hand out something is
 
04:36:53.470 --> 04:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
to show you a couple charts the first
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
chart on the first page is simply the
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
bell curve if you take the 165,000
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
students we have't public schools in New
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you test them on whatever
 
04:37:04.590 --> 04:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
you test them on you're going to get a
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
bell curve from high Achievers to low
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
Achievers and it looks something like
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
this there are going to be some low
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
Achievers some higher Achievers now the
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
question of proficiency however is not a
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
factual thing the bell curve is factual
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
proficiency is a level established
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
politically and
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
professionally and so on the second page
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
I show that vertical black bar
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's just hypothetical some State some
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
Community decided that's where we're
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
going to call anybody to the right of
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
that proficient anybody to the left of
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
it has not met it but that bar can move
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
in fact some states when they discovered
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
that not too many of their students were
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
doing very well in the measures they had
 
04:37:58.750 --> 04:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
they simply moved it
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
down okay so
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
proficiency is a political decision what
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
what are you going to Define as
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
proficiency but the most important part
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
of what I want to say
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
is that the bell curve of students
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
differs depending on their
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
backgrounds so the third little chart I
 
04:38:24.029 --> 04:38:24.039 align:start position:0%
have shows that the bell curve of
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
students from lower income families is
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
shifted to the
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
left that's on any set of measures you
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
want to use in any
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
country but alone State and higher
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
income families is shifted to the right
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
now what does that mean with regard to
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
proficiency if you look at that chart it
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
means there are more students in the
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
bell curve that's moved to the left who
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
are below
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
proficient and this
 
04:39:01.629 --> 04:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
bill would take funds that the state
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
provides whether it's the base cost
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
which I interpret the bill the mean
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
rather than the low and um the free and
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch uh supplemental funds but
 
04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
what this bill would
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
do is that the districts like Franklin
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
Claremont Winchester Stratford
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
haal um which have higher percentages of
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
students from the lower income families
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
the blue curve on the
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
left would end up losing money much more
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
money than districts like Hanover Oyster
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
River Windom which are have a bell curve
 
04:39:44.910 --> 04:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
to the right
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
so State policy currently recognizes the
 
04:39:51.390 --> 04:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
need for extra
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
money for disadvantaged students
 
04:39:59.470 --> 04:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
including those who are from lowincome
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
families and it's not a lot but it's
 
04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
there in the in the distribution formula
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
but this bill if enacted would do the
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
exact opposite it would remove money
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
from the districts where there is the
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
most need for
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
improvement and that's the reason that I
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill but not the
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
goals of the sponsors thank you very
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
much Mr Hall are there question
 
04:40:28.520 --> 04:40:29.868 align:start position:0%
much Mr Hall are there question
represent

04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
Pell yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
you very much for taking my question and
 
04:40:35.948 --> 04:40:35.958 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
um I think what I'm hearing you say is
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
that if we continue to fund education
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
the way we've always funded
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
education that districts like clar
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
Franklin Claremont Winchester and
 
04:40:51.150 --> 04:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
straford will probably continue to stay
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
in the category of lower
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
Achievers do you suppose it's possible
 
04:40:59.628 --> 04:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
that if we tried a different method of
 
04:41:02.350 --> 04:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
Education funding we might get a
 
04:41:02.360 --> 04:41:03.628 align:start position:0%
Education funding we might get a
different

04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:05.628 align:start position:0%
different
outcome

04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
04:41:10.110 --> 04:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes I do think so um
 
04:41:13.270 --> 04:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
and the question
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
is how you go about doing that um it's
 
04:41:21.628 --> 04:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me from my experience with
 
04:41:21.638 --> 04:41:23.230 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me from my experience with
this

04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
that we have districts that cannot
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
afford to spend funds because they
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
property taxes that their uh homeowners
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
and business owners have to pay are so
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
high so there's a need for additional
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
funds not reduced funds in those
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
communities yet uh earlier this morning
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
there was testimony about Pittsfield
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
where they don't have any foreign
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
language teachers now that's not eighth
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
grade that's above that but um and the
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
only way that we're going to
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
improve the achievement of students no
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
matter what they're family income is is
 
04:42:08.830 --> 04:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to how we're doing it I
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the things the
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor was talking about but removing
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
funds from the very districts that most
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
have the most students in need in
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
special need um just makes no sense to
 
04:42:27.390 --> 04:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
me represent
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you just to follow on
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
to that question um on that last chart
 
04:42:35.030 --> 04:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
that you showed um you have the lower
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
income families and the higher income
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
families uh how would a different method
 
04:42:41.958 --> 04:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
families uh how would a different method
of

04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
funding um impact that chart when you're
 
04:42:48.270 --> 04:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
families um rather than uh school
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
funding or um you know anything else I'm
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
not sure the um correlation between um
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
different funding and this chart this
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
there a lot of ways I'll just use one if
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
you have um a lot of students who are
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
starting off um behind other students
 
04:43:19.150 --> 04:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
you need to pay attention to them you
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
need to have lower class sizes if you
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
have more lowincome
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
students okay so if one way that you
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
begin to pay attention to that is well I
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
know the the state stat statute sets um
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
2025 students uh 2530 students as uh the
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
maximum for class size but if you if you
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
have a larger number of lowincome
 
04:43:54.030 --> 04:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
students um students whose parents never
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
completed High School you're going to
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
need to pay more attention to them one
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
way not the only way is to have lower
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
further further questions repent
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
being here um I just wanted to get a
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
little clarification because you
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
described the bell curve as related to
 
04:44:21.628 --> 04:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
the variable of family income and
 
04:44:21.638 --> 04:44:22.670 align:start position:0%
the variable of family income and
student

04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:44:25.948 --> 04:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
performance um given that our current
 
04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
funding formula uh emphasizes low income
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
through our free uh student launch
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
formula and directs more funding to
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
places with lower more lower income
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
families um does that are you suggesting
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
with that that belt curve that it
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how much funding is
 
04:44:50.430 --> 04:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
directed to them by the state that
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're always going to be lower
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
Achievers because of their family
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
income I don't think they will always be
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
lower Achievers because of their family
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
income no and and also remember that the
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
bell curve even within the
 
04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
if you will segregated segregated group
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
of low-income families has high
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
Achievers it just has fewer of them it's
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
still a bell curve but no I think that
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
you can move the bell curve with the
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
right kinds of investment in the schools
 
04:45:24.150 --> 04:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
in in the education of those students so
 
04:45:26.190 --> 04:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
you know the an appropriate goal and I
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
think I share it with the sponsor of the
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill is if if that blue curve could be
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
shifted over and be the same as the red
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
curve on that chart we've done something
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful I think we
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
would share that goal so the question is
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
how to do it I think there are ways to
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
do it but it requires money as I said
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
smaller class sizes
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
help further questions representative
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
pet now thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question there's a
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
phrase that necessity is the mother of
 
04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
invention do you suppose it's possible
 
04:46:03.868 --> 04:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
that if we use a different funding
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
mechanis ISM Educators might find a
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
different way an Innovative approach to
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
educating and all of a sudden these
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
lower income families start doing better
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
because there's been some innovation in
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
their education I think that's possible
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I maybe I'll just answer another um a
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
part of the question about how would you
 
04:46:32.430 --> 04:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
um if we had a Statewide teachers
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
contract we would not have have
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
districts that can't hire teachers
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
because their salaries are so
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
low so if you want to talk about
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
possible policies that might help with
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
the situation State one single Statewide
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
teachers contract so the teachers get
 
04:46:52.110 --> 04:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
paid the same amount no matter which
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
district they're working in would be a
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that's just a personal point
 
04:47:01.230 --> 04:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's a dream isn't
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
it any anything for Mr holl further
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
Coral thank you Carissa Coro uh Penacook
 
04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
and um I thought about which where I
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
should Testify the last bill or this one
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
um only because my uh testimony is about
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes and thinking about the
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
assumption that that the tests or the
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
assessment the tools are good good tools
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
to measure what students know it can do
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
when my brother went to when he was
 
04:47:41.470 --> 04:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
going to first grade 1987 my mother
 
04:47:43.310 --> 04:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
brought him to the test that we all had
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
to do and um the decision on the test if
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to first grade or you
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to go to Readiness um and so he
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
went into the test he knew how to count
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
to 20 he knew his colors his alphabet
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
all of those things and um when he came
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
out of the test I told my mother that
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
they were recommending him for Readiness
 
04:48:05.590 --> 04:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
and my mother was a young mother and so
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
she just you know okay they they know
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
best but she got in the car and she said
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
Billy why did they say you didn't know
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
your colors and your numbers and your
 
04:48:16.948 --> 04:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
letters and he said well they're adults
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
they asked me what color is the sky I
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
said purple color is the grass I said
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
yellow they are adults they asked me
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
stupid questions I gave them stupid
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
answers and so um in my work in talking
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
about assessment with teachers and
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
having them rethink assessment um I use
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
that example because we can only assess
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
what students are willing to share share
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
with us that they know and can do and so
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
for younger students on standardized
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
tests they might be willing to show up
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
so if they can access the test and they
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
can um fill out the bubbles and and do
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
all that stuff and they're willing to
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
right maybe we can understand what they
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
know and can do but as students get
 
04:48:59.948 --> 04:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
older and they're more rebellious and
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the test is not meaningful to them they
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
are not as willing to partic participate
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
in this extractive game of standardized
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
tests and so there are more meaningful
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
ways that we can assess student
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
understanding based on what they can do
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
um the tests mul I I don't have my my
 
04:49:20.510 --> 04:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
own children take standardized tests I
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
tell the teachers I trust your judgment
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
on whether my student can read and on
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
what level based on your professional
 
04:49:28.990 --> 04:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
judgment those tests are not connected
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
to my students assessment is human work
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
um and we need to remember that these
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
tests are based on psychometric Theory
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
and not the very um human work of
 
04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
Education in terms of students telling
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
us what they know and can do based on
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
their individual experiences and
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
skills thank you very much other
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
deer

04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the third time
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee and
 
04:50:13.708 --> 04:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
chairman lad my name is Michaela Deiter
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
and although I do sit on the Dober
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
School Board as I mentioned earlier in
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
the following comments I'm going to be
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
speaking just for myself in fact I
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on coming up here and
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on this bill but after hearing
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
it be introduced I decided to um add my
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
comments I apologize for that reason I
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any written comments to
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
submit to you but I'm happy to submit
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
them online
 
04:50:38.030 --> 04:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
afterward I've listened to this bill's
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor list her ideals for the outcome
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
of her proposed Bill hb1
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
1675 I heard her say she does not want
 
04:50:47.948 --> 04:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
to or intend to cause school districts
 
04:50:50.350 --> 04:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
to lose funding rather she hopes this
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
stick as she described it would
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
incentivize and Inspire districts to
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
begin educating their students in a way
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that results in for some underperforming
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
districts drastic increases in academic
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
proficiency we know that students with
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
specific designations historically
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
underperform on state tests indeed our
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
current funding model acknowledges this
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
by offering differentiated aid for
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
students who are English language
 
04:51:17.548 --> 04:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
Learners or who come from economically
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged home situations we know
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
this is also true for students with
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
established special education plans this
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
bill creates an allowance for students
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
with disabilities to be exempt from this
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
financial penalty for
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
underperformance it is both uneven and
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
inequitable to exempt special education
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
students without also acknowledging that
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
students living in poverty or who may be
 
04:51:42.990 --> 04:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
new Americans learning a new language
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
experience similar academic
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
challenges to be clear I strongly oppose
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation financially
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
punishing districts and thereby the
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
students they serve because some
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
students do not achieve high enough
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
scores is not a Funding Solution that
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
will serve our schools our students or
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
our state expecting schools to do a
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
better job educating students while
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
simultaneously reducing state aid defies
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
all logic as we have heard so many times
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
already today the state has a
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional responsibility to
 
04:52:18.110 --> 04:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
adequately educate its students I have
 
04:52:20.910 --> 04:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
heard no substantiation offered today
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
for why reducing funding to our most
 
04:52:25.868 --> 04:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
needy students would somehow Inspire
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
them and their school districts to
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
achieve more this bill's primary sponsor
 
04:52:32.190 --> 04:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
has spoken about her desire to increase
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
math Proficiency in schools based on her
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
love for and education in mathematics I
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
submit to you today that in the matter
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
of providing an adequate education to
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public School students her
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
math does not add up thank you very much
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
Trumble

04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
Trumble
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Trumble from the
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
town aware I oppose this bill for a
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
couple reasons first I think it's based
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
on the false notion that schools are
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
like private companies that operate on a
 
04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
playing field that's level that all
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
schools are level all families are level
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
all educational opportunities and
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
systems are level and that's just not
 
04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
the reality you've heard testimony that
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
children from low-income families have
 
04:53:34.350 --> 04:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
lower educational outcomes and we have
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
to push that bell curve over but that is
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
a reality that we deal with the 2020
 
04:53:43.230 --> 04:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
Commission in its executive summary has
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
a chart I urge you to look at it and
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's just based on free and reduced
 
04:53:49.628 --> 04:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
lunch and it shows you that as your
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
income drops your scores drop and it's
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
just clear as can be that has to be
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
dealt with this bill would punish those
 
04:53:59.070 --> 04:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
children rather than give them the help
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
they need the other way in which this uh
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
manifests itself is in the tax base
 
04:54:07.868 --> 04:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have adequate tax bases
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
are not able to provide the same level
 
04:54:11.708 --> 04:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
of Education as others and that's why
 
04:54:13.708 --> 04:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
they can't pay their teachers as much
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's why they can't afford reading
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
Specialists the very things that the the
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill wants those
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
children under this system right this
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
bill will lose funding if you go to the
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
doa's website of proficiencies it's got
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
all kinds of data but you can look at
 
04:54:32.670 --> 04:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
the Town level for every town for math
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
and reading I urge you to do that pick a
 
04:54:36.430 --> 04:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
property poor town anyone you want and
 
04:54:38.190 --> 04:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
then pick a property rich town that
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
adjoins it and what you'll see is that
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
in the property poort Town there's a lot
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
of children in who are in levels one and
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
two and not that many in level four but
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
the property Rich toown the inverse is
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
true there'll be loads of children in
 
04:54:51.788 --> 04:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
level three and four and not many in
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
level one and two they have basically
 
04:54:56.510 --> 04:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
the same educational philosophies they
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
just don't have the same resources so
 
04:55:00.990 --> 04:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill is going to do is punish
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
the towns that don't have a property tax
 
04:55:05.708 --> 04:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
tax base and give them even less money
 
04:55:07.470 --> 04:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
and the year after that even less money
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the year after that even less money
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
to the point where they won't be able to
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
even keep their schools open the goal of
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
increasing education is great this bill
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
is just going to punish the people who
 
04:55:21.390 --> 04:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
need the education the most the other
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is it assumes
 
04:55:24.430 --> 04:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
that schools are not operating
 
04:55:26.430 --> 04:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
rationally right now that teachers don't
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
go into school every day and think how
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
can I help this child they like I said
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
earlier today I'm married to a teacher
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
every night she works in until late
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's and there's other people emailing
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
back to her the other teachers they're
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
all working long long hours because they
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
care about their children they know that
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
the kids are coming in with a lot of
 
04:55:46.350 --> 04:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
issues these days they're trying to
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
compensate for that and work hard for
 
04:55:51.548 --> 04:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
those kids they take a English class or
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
a social studies class and they work
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
reading into it they if they have charts
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
they work a little math into it they do
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
all that when they have a child who has
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
extra special needs they try to make
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
extra efforts and figure out how can I
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
solve this or how can I help this child
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
moving along the Assumption of this bill
 
04:56:10.548 --> 04:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
is that the teachers either don't care
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
or just aren't qualified and the school
 
04:56:15.070 --> 04:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
systems are oblivious to this it's it's
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
a false story and I hope that eventually
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
this state stops having these false
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
stories and starts recognizing our
 
04:56:24.150 --> 04:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
teachers for the dedicated professionals
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
that they are we treat them to the
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
respect that they deserve and then once
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
we agree on that then I think the rest
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
of the issues will move forward much
 
04:56:34.350 --> 04:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
more smoothly thank you very much thank
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
you are there questions from the
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Pell thank
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming in
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
and taking my question you're welcome
 
04:56:46.270 --> 04:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
have you ever seen any statistics or
 
04:56:49.868 --> 04:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
data um that demonstrates how
 
04:56:52.548 --> 04:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
children um say in a Regional School
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
District um from surrounding towns that
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
may have a lower or may have a higher
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
incidents of free and reduced meal
 
04:57:01.150 --> 04:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
students perform when they attend a
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
school that is in a town where the
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
property values are higher so say you
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
have you know students from surrounding
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
towns in elementary schools and then
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
they go to a regional middle or High
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
School uh I I don't really know the data
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that I'm sorry but thank you for the
 
04:57:20.190 --> 04:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
question further questions from the
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee representa beler thank you Mr
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for this testimony
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to get a little more
 
04:57:28.510 --> 04:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
clarification because again we heard the
 
04:57:28.520 --> 04:57:29.150 align:start position:0%
clarification because again we heard the
the

04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
relationship between parental income and
 
04:57:32.718 --> 04:57:33.910 align:start position:0%
relationship between parental income and
student

04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
performance and I understand that the
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
concept of of the bell curve and that
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
these are two different variables that
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
are being related but it's still not
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
clicking with me if you could explain
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
the causitive relationship between them
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
that is being suggested since parents
 
04:57:51.628 --> 04:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
aren't paying out of pocket for public
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
school this is not something that's a
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
burden to their income so you're asking
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
are you asking thank you for the
 
04:57:58.948 --> 04:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
question representative belter are you
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
asking why would children from families
 
04:58:03.628 --> 04:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
with lower incomes have lower
 
04:58:06.270 --> 04:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
educational results yes it seems to be
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
suggested that it was a positive factor
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
for lower performance but and it's being
 
04:58:14.548 --> 04:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
related to in uh funding but I don't see
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
how it's related I don't understand the
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
linkage okay so first of all
 
04:58:21.788 --> 04:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
representative Hall indicated that
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
within the bell curve you're going to
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
have low and high under whether it's low
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
income or high
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
income there's going to be that variable
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not we're not nobody's
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
saying that children who are from low
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
income families are not capable or don't
 
04:58:38.310 --> 04:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
have you don't have children who
 
04:58:39.868 --> 04:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
outperform children from high income
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
families it's just when you're taking
 
04:58:43.750 --> 04:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
the averages he's saying the average
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
bell curve versus the other average bell
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
curve so I just want to make clear of
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
that um I think the other thing that
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Hall said was that the
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
the the clear correlations are parents
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
education and also um the parents income
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
level I believe were the two variables
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
that he cited and he's says this
 
04:59:07.230 --> 04:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
translates to a commitment to education
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
and it may not be I'm not saying that
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
somebody from a low-income parents
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
aren't committed education uh I I'm my
 
04:59:16.350 --> 04:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
parents came from from very poor
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and but it it can mean
 
04:59:21.070 --> 04:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you're from a low-income
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
you may not have the time to be able to
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
devote to your child if you're working
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
three jobs a week or you're a single
 
04:59:29.070 --> 04:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
parent who's also working three jobs a
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
week or maybe you're like the stories we
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
heard this morning where you're being
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
raised by your grandparent or there's so
 
04:59:38.270 --> 04:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
many different variables where low
 
04:59:40.510 --> 04:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
income can be attached to other factors
 
04:59:42.548 --> 04:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's not income that makes you not a
 
04:59:45.310 --> 04:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
good achiever it's the low income brings
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
with it many other variables and those
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
variables do translate to to educational
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties which can be solved with
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
lower classroom sizes I don't have the
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
studies with me today I wasn't thinking
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
this debate was going to go on but back
 
05:00:01.708 --> 05:00:01.718 align:start position:0%
under the EFA debate I brought in some
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
evidence there was a study quoted dozens
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
of studies when we spend more money
 
05:00:10.350 --> 05:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
Dropout rates go down uh scores go up
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
attendance at colleges goes up lifetime
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
income goes up dramatically so spending
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
more money on schools does work and it's
 
05:00:19.470 --> 05:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
especially effective in lowincome school
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
districts and there was a great study
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
from Texas that came out on that very
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
point just
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
recently I me just a real quick one
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
because I I I think I understand the
 
05:00:30.548 --> 05:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
linkage better now thank you for that
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
explanation yes but seeing that we
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
already do at the state level send extra
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
money for the poverty indicator of free
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch how much more are you
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we need to spend to
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
equalize that outcome so the extra
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
amount for free and reduced lunch is I
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
think $2,000 or something on that range
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the overall
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
statistics the average school spends
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
20,000 there are schools that can only
 
05:01:00.990 --> 05:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
afford to spend 13 or 14,000 per per
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
student so we have a big Gap to make up
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's huge and if they need
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
extra money instead of having five or
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
6,000 less per student in that town
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
they're the the ones that probably need
 
05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
2,000 even more than the average so it
 
05:01:15.160 --> 05:01:15.868 align:start position:0%
2,000 even more than the average so it
it

05:01:15.868 --> 05:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
gets as a state we have looking with
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
pride at our educational system but we
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
have a blind eye for the fact that the
 
05:01:25.470 --> 05:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
property Rich towns can provide great
 
05:01:27.868 --> 05:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
schools and they keep those great
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
teachers our property poor towns can't
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
do that and that's the problem and so
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
all the solutions have got to be focused
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
on those towns but taking money away
 
05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
from them because they fail is going to
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
cause the exact opposite result that we
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
want you're
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions from the
 
05:01:52.510 --> 05:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and we have one more red
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
pink card on on
 
05:01:59.310 --> 05:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
1675 uh Zach
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
Shen interested time I'll my testimony
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
because speakers have thank you the
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
point thank you very much so with that
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
1555 welcome representative HS well I'm
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to get to your
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill so go ahead um I'm introducing
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
1555 um this is uh from the batch of
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
bills that I receive that um I'm doing
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Education
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
asked for them this is number three and
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll dispatch it the same way
 
05:02:54.510 --> 05:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
you did the first two um it's it's very
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
simple um it has to do with uh I'll let
 
05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
um Mark explain the details of it but I
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
listened to what he had to say and
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
essentially um he's asking that when it
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
comes to an existing provision that
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
allows the school districts to change
 
05:03:16.280 --> 05:03:17.350 align:start position:0%
allows the school districts to change
their

05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
budget that the Department of
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
Education is the one who will explain to
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
them what the limits are about how much
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
how much they can add or how much um
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
they can subtract because they don't
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
always get it right so thank you so we
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to have Mark next so if
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions let's ask Mark
 
05:03:47.708 --> 05:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
Magan magella I I deal deal with them
 
05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
often times but you know I always have
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
trouble stumbling on his
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
mark

05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
for the record Mark manganello
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Bureau of school
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
Finance um so I think this bill or this
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
concept is maybe simple to someone like
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
representative fellow who did my job
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
before me for for several multiple
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
decades um so for it's a little inside
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
baseball so I'm just going to walk you
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
through a hyal uh hypothetical district
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
and how current law works and what this
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to change so for example
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
if we use havil as a hypothetical
 
05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
District havil received an adequacy
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
estimate of State revenues on November
 
05:04:41.990 --> 05:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
15th from the Department for fiscal year
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
25 as they were working on this fall and
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
winter on their fiscal year 25 budget
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
they received a number let's say that
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
number is 500,000 in adequacy
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue um now they're going to adopt um
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
if they if they pass it adopt a budget
 
05:05:00.750 --> 05:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 24 that's going to be
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 25 budget
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
then what all of you could do the
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature is you could change fiscal
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
year 25 adequacy through an change in
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
law and so you could say we want to give
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
all districts an extra x amount of money
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
based on whatever and so let's say you
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
Chang the law and you in change the 25
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
formula after they've passed their
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
budget now when they were building their
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
budget they thought they were going to
 
05:05:27.040 --> 05:05:28.190 align:start position:0%
budget they thought they were going to
get

05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
500,000 now you've changed the law and
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
now let's say they're going to get
 
05:05:31.718 --> 05:05:33.628 align:start position:0%
now let's say they're going to get
600,000

05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
600,000
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
so um they've already passed a budget
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
and they didn't know that they were
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
going to get this extra
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so there's a provision in
 
05:05:43.708 --> 05:05:43.718 align:start position:0%
current law that says okay you passed
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
your budget but state law changed and
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
now you have an extra 100,000 so RSA
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
1973a says you already did your normal
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
annual town meeting now you can do a
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
special district meeting and so where
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
the confusion comes into play is I gave
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
say hey rolls the school district I said
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
you're getting $500,000 and I said that
 
05:06:06.030 --> 05:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
in November 15th they built their budget
 
05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
off that $500,000 number now let's say
 
05:06:11.390 --> 05:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
new data comes in the State Law changes
 
05:06:13.350 --> 05:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I say now you're getting
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
$600,000 so I want to use the provision
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
hail is probably thinking maybe I want
 
05:06:20.430 --> 05:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
to use the provisions of RSA 1973a to
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
increase my budget because I didn't know
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
that money was going to come in and so
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
they might go well I can make a warrant
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
article for $100,000 because that's how
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
much additional money I've received but
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's not how current law Works um the
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
way way current law works is I have to
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
tell all the districts that state law
 
05:06:37.230 --> 05:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
has now
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
changed um and they are thinking they
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
they can see that they have an extra
 
05:06:43.350 --> 05:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in this hypothetical but they
 
05:06:44.830 --> 05:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
have to wait for me to do a second
 
05:06:46.548 --> 05:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
analysis before they can determine what
 
05:06:49.070 --> 05:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
the maximum War article it is they can
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
put on the uh uh have hearings for and
 
05:06:54.030 --> 05:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
put in special district meeting and the
 
05:06:55.708 --> 05:06:55.718 align:start position:0%
way I do that is I basically have to
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
isolate all changes in adequacy that are
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
due to state law um so for some
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
communities it could be so basically in
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
the hypothetical um what I end up doing
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
is I end up taking the current latest
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
data and I run it through the old
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
formula and I run it through the new
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
formula and I come up with the variance
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so it might not be $100,000 it might
 
05:07:17.230 --> 05:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
be $80,000 it might be
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
$120,000 and so districts are trying to
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
run special district meeting but I'm
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
holding them up a little bit because
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for a two spreadsheets
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
one that says what they're really going
 
05:07:29.708 --> 05:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
to get in reality and then they're also
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
waiting on a spreadsheet for me which
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
has this sort of hypothetical reality is
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
if isolated only changes in state law to
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula and um a lot of
 
05:07:39.470 --> 05:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
districts get it because I spend a lot
 
05:07:41.548 --> 05:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
of time educating them on what they have
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
to do with their warrant articles but in
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
the past um I believe it's happened once
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
at least um in memory Dr has had to deny
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
a warrn article because a district
 
05:07:53.788 --> 05:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
thought that they were going to get what
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
we estimated versus what the actual was
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
they thought that was the what they
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
could do for a warrant article but they
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
exceeded what the statutory change was
 
05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
and so um Dr had to kind of give a warn
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
article a haircut because of it um so it
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of extra work on our end
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
to educate them about the Nuance of the
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
law I have to run a second spreadsheet
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
of adequacy which I never like having
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
two competing adequacy spreadsheets out
 
05:08:17.320 --> 05:08:18.670 align:start position:0%
two competing adequacy spreadsheets out
there

05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
um and so if we change this law and um
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's only changing how we determine
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
what their maximum warrant article may
 
05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
be um it just follows a more intuitive
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
process which is your warrant article
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
will be uh maximum War article will be
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
the difference between what you thought
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
you were going to get and what you
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually got um and not this additional
 
05:08:42.548 --> 05:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
calculation sorry if everyone follows
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
that representative Cornell you're gonna
 
05:08:47.948 --> 05:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
notes Mark comes from LBA legislative
 
05:08:53.070 --> 05:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
budger Assistance
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
Office okay are there any
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
mark thank you very much we'll see you
 
05:09:04.590 --> 05:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.150 --> 05:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other people testifying on
 
05:09:07.160 --> 05:09:08.750 align:start position:0%
are there any other people testifying on
this

05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.470 --> 05:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
hearing okay
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
except uh do it in nature where we are
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
with our
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
schedule no we're going to try get
 
05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
closer to schedule here um so we are now
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to open up HB 1686 there people
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
waiting here for this one uh this is
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
relative to requiring excess revenues
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
raised through the Statewide education
 
05:09:40.350 --> 05:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
property tax to be remitted to the
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and prohibiting the
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
from setting negative local and County
 
05:09:49.230 --> 05:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
tax rates on real
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
property okay Prime sponsor March you're
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
here representative Smith welcome thank
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair I'm delighted to
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
be here before the education committee I
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
was a little surprised that the bill was
 
05:10:09.150 --> 05:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
sent here um but glad because it's
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
always good to have more people familiar
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
with this issue I also by the way am
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
pleased that you worked with the speaker
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um members of uh Ways
 
05:10:24.430 --> 05:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
and Means and finance would be included
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
in some discussions since this is
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
probably where that bill goes you know
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
when they say it's not about the money
 
05:10:36.310 --> 05:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
it always is about the money always
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
about the dollar and yet the basic
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
principle here is a principle that all
 
05:10:45.270 --> 05:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
of you on this committee have dealt with
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
and that is trying to make
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
um uh that that adequacy funds are uh
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
distributed in a way that meets
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements I want to
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
point out to you that since I asked
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
um uh OS to draft this bill um I had
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
some unexpected help from uh the third
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
branch of government from the judicial
 
05:11:21.868 --> 05:11:21.878 align:start position:0%
branch because unbeknownst to
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
me while I had already asked for this
 
05:11:31.110 --> 05:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill to be drafted um uh the judge rof
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
ruled straight that swept is currently
 
05:11:38.430 --> 05:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
administered is
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and that is exactly
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
the issue that I'm trying to address
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
here I come from durm and I know you all
 
05:11:49.948 --> 05:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
think things are crazy in Durham and you
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
don't do things in hail the way you do
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
in Durham I understand all the time well
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
because you're the chair I mean I could
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
pick on someplace else but I mean you
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
know why would I it makes more sense to
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
power maybe it's different in havil but
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
in Durham you know the town doesn't pay
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
the taxes my town does not pay my taxes
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
maybe your town does in haval or
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
someplace else but in Durham we pay the
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
citizens pay the taxes and for reasons
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
that I could discuss with you from an
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
historical perspective because I was
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
here when this
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
happened um
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
tax was
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
collected by the town or the city or
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
however you want to do that and they got
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
to keep the float not only that they
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually got new computers and all kinds
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
of things all of that in return for them
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
acting as agents for the um for the
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
state but what has happened is the money
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
that is the Statewide educational
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
property tax is supposed to be used for
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
education and it's supposed to be
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
allocated according to the formula that
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
we in our wisdom or lack thereof have
 
05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
established and there are towns and you
 
05:13:23.110 --> 05:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
can see it in in the bill back of the
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill we actually have a timely fiscal
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
note which is really good you could see
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of towns that
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
have received more
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
money than they need under the formulas
 
05:13:38.280 --> 05:13:39.230 align:start position:0%
money than they need under the formulas
we

05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
established to meet the
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
educational uh expenditures of their
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
community and what has been happening is
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
towns have used that money for anything
 
05:13:54.510 --> 05:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
else that they feel like it but it's not
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
their money it's the citizens money the
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
citizens were paying the tax or in some
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
cases a Dr has actually constructed
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
something that I have a hard time
 
05:14:07.760 --> 05:14:08.990 align:start position:0%
something that I have a hard time
understanding

05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
05:14:13.590 --> 05:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
but you know who am I where they have a
 
05:14:13.600 --> 05:14:15.150 align:start position:0%
but you know who am I where they have a
negative

05:14:15.150 --> 05:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
negative
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
rate now if you could figure out that
 
05:14:20.910 --> 05:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
negative rate you're better than I am um
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm be glad to hear from it what
 
05:14:27.788 --> 05:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to do is make
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
Fair the
 
05:14:33.310 --> 05:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
utilization of the educate of the
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide educational property tax and
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
in those
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions where they're not they
 
05:14:41.350 --> 05:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
don't use that
 
05:14:45.390 --> 05:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
money for educational adequacy as we
 
05:14:50.270 --> 05:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
have decided that money should go back
 
05:14:53.430 --> 05:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
into the state coffers now you have to
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand that it's already been
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
figured that it's in the state coffers
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
because that was how much money was
 
05:15:00.910 --> 05:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
raised by the Statewide educational
 
05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
05:15:04.110 --> 05:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
this is just saying that when it gets
 
05:15:06.670 --> 05:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
expended it gets expended in the right
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
way um it's not terribly complicated I
 
05:15:13.628 --> 05:15:13.638 align:start position:0%
was delighted that the judge supported
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
this um argument there was a case that
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
had been brought and made these points
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the judge agreed with it um but now
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is here and um I I urge you to
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
take this as one of the easy ones that
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to deal with
 
05:15:34.430 --> 05:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the Myriad education bills that you
 
05:15:39.310 --> 05:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
have before you and uh just kind of do a
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
little accounting correction here and I
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the time to
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
present the argument thank you very much
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh represent
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
Cornell you have a question yes thank
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Smith being
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
here um just wondering what do you
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
expect uh the impact to be
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
in those towns that have an excess swept
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is now being returned to the state
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
I would expect that the money that
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't really belong to the town
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
because it's our money and it was raised
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
to meet Statewide expenses because don't
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
you this is not the local education tax
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
this is the state education tax that
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
that money will go back into the pot and
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
be used for the purpose is that we in
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature have said it should be
 
05:16:38.750 --> 05:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
used for um you know if I wanted to
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
really give an
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
example and I didn't want
 
05:16:48.990 --> 05:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
it to offend the um the chair I would
 
05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
say molten Boro I mean we can all think
 
05:16:56.590 --> 05:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
of people we know or know of who have
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly wonderful terrific valuable
 
05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:04.990 align:start position:0%
incredibly wonderful terrific valuable
expensive

05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:09.310 --> 05:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
spreads in molten Boro and I kind of
 
05:17:12.270 --> 05:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that you or I should have
 
05:17:12.280 --> 05:17:13.310 align:start position:0%
don't think that you or I should have
the

05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility of saving
 
05:17:20.788 --> 05:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
them uh from having to invest in
 
05:17:23.190 --> 05:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
educating children in this state and
 
05:17:25.470 --> 05:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's what's going on now all I'm
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying is just level the planing
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
field thank you yes follow up yes thank
 
05:17:31.280 --> 05:17:32.030 align:start position:0%
field thank you yes follow up yes thank
you

05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
um but I used to represent molten buror
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
oh if I had only known that I would have
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
picked another town that's okay I'll
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
pick on I'll pick on my own towns um if
 
05:17:45.628 --> 05:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
you look at uh for instance My Town
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro if you look at the medium
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
median income in Tuftonboro it is in the
 
05:17:53.590 --> 05:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the pack and I think wolfboro
 
05:17:56.110 --> 05:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
is even lower in terms of the median
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
family income so you know if you're
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
saying that um these are rich
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
communities um I don't think that the
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
facts behold that
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
argument I absolutely on this issue
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
alone representative cardelli I agree
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
with you not 99% but 100% I think you're
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely right and that is exactly my
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
point this isn't the money that has uh
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
that we should be spending to make it
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
possible for people at the lowest end of
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
the income scale to have access to the
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
same quality education we want everybody
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
else to have that's not what this money
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
is this money came from individuals
 
05:18:43.270 --> 05:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes supposedly for the
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax the
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
money should go to the state if it's not
 
05:18:54.030 --> 05:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
being used by those towns that have
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
banked it um to meet educational needs
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
and some of that money representative
 
05:19:03.430 --> 05:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
cordelli might in the long run be able
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
to be used to address the needs of those
 
05:19:09.558 --> 05:19:11.230 align:start position:0%
to be used to address the needs of those
uh

05:19:11.230 --> 05:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are in
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
schools which need a little extra help
 
05:19:22.270 --> 05:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
because of the limited income
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
of their
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
residents thank you but that don't bite
 
05:19:29.788 --> 05:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not representative
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr Mr chair and thank
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Smith for being here
 
05:19:37.788 --> 05:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
now you you are a veteran legislator
 
05:19:39.868 --> 05:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
here and so I want to ask you a
 
05:19:39.878 --> 05:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
here and so I want to ask you a
historical

05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
historical
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
question uh originally the swep was
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
created out of a state out of a decision
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
made by the um by the Supreme Court
 
05:19:53.030 --> 05:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with school funding and it's my
 
05:19:56.230 --> 05:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was collected
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
basically as you're saying here that it
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
was remitted all the state swept money
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
was remitted
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
to the Dr at one point in time and then
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
as I understand it in 2011 or so it
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
stopped can you give us a a
 
05:20:17.708 --> 05:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
would I have
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
Theory and I have some facts to back it
 
05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
up um but the facts that I have to back
 
05:20:35.628 --> 05:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
up would involve my pointing fingers 10
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
or 15 years after the fact at certain
 
05:20:42.628 --> 05:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
institutions in this state that saw a
 
05:20:42.638 --> 05:20:43.788 align:start position:0%
institutions in this state that saw a
good

05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
thing and um I don't think that's going
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
to help any of us in trying to deal
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
today with the problems that we're
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
facing so um perhaps we could have a cup
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
of tea privately um uh representative
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
Mila but for now I would just say that
 
05:21:07.628 --> 05:21:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to address the problems of
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
meeting the educational needs of our
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
children going back to the initial
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
decision when we didn't accept well we
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
accepted the alic formula except for one
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
little thing we didn't fund it and since
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
then decision after decision after a
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
decision has been made sometimes
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
shortsighted sometimes
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
meeting needs of one group or another
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I think we
 
05:21:45.670 --> 05:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
now particularly because of the courts
 
05:21:48.910 --> 05:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
but not only because of the courts um I
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
think we now have an opportunity to see
 
05:21:55.390 --> 05:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
if we can get us closer to the perfect
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
more perfect union okay it's a followup
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
please so you you will confirm though
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
that up until
 
05:22:06.430 --> 05:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
2011 the swept was in fact a Statewide
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
tax collected remitted to Dr and at on
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
2011 that system stopped I corre believe
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that that is so and I know
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
that there are people behind me who know
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
much more about it than I do thank
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
you but that date is
 
05:22:24.240 --> 05:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
you but that date is
accurate

05:22:26.310 --> 05:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
2011 uh any further questions of the
 
05:22:29.958 --> 05:22:31.548 align:start position:0%
2011 uh any further questions of the
representative

05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:31.558 --> 05:22:33.070 align:start position:0%
representative
represent

05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
belard thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:22:37.628 --> 05:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
for bringing us forward um so I'm
 
05:22:40.350 --> 05:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
following the the base Logic the idea
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
that a a state tax should not
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily be utilized to offset local
 
05:22:49.150 --> 05:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
um non-education items makees some
 
05:22:52.548 --> 05:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
sense I'm not sure the solution that is
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
in here makes quite as much sense I'm
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
hoping you can talk me through it so
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're saying that if schools or rather
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
local uh districts their towns don't um
 
05:23:05.788 --> 05:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
utilize this toward their schools then
 
05:23:08.270 --> 05:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
it will be remitted to the state coffers
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
at which point it can be redistributed
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
to places that may it may need it more
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I think the question is do we really
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
expect that if we tell towns use it or
 
05:23:19.990 --> 05:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
lose it they're actually not going to
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
use it and we're going to have money
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
flowing back to the state from
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
this well I don't think that's it I hear
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um I of course always
 
05:23:31.948 --> 05:23:31.958 align:start position:0%
believe that all are going to try to do
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
the right thing always maybe it doesn't
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
always happen that way but that's what I
 
05:23:41.948 --> 05:23:41.958 align:start position:0%
think but here what we're talking about
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
is uh formulas that we establish here
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
right here dollar amounts that we
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
establish right here where we say to
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
education

05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:24:05.070 --> 05:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
if they're not using it for
 
05:24:07.430 --> 05:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
education for any number of reasons
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
including that they don't need it
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
because they have unlike
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
Durham um they have a a tax rate that
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for them to manage these
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
things um they're not supporting a
 
05:24:21.390 --> 05:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
university for example
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
um that money should go back to where it
 
05:24:26.310 --> 05:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
belongs go right back
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
into the
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
bank and then go out
 
05:24:36.910 --> 05:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
for purposes that are specified and um I
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
think that's something that's just
 
05:24:38.798 --> 05:24:39.868 align:start position:0%
think that's something that's just
common

05:24:39.868 --> 05:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
common
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
sense um maybe I'm
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
naive I probably am
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
naive you're being
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
streamed any further questions from the
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%

absolutely thank you thank you Mr yeah

05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
of Coalition communities 2.0 which is a
 
05:25:41.470 --> 05:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
group of 27 cities and towns that have
 
05:25:44.270 --> 05:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
come together to ensure that any future
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
Funding Solution for state aid to
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
education does not unfairly pit one
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
municipality against others by mandating
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
that tax money raised in one
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipality be sent to another town to
 
05:26:00.400 --> 05:26:01.230 align:start position:0%
municipality be sent to another town to
be

05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated on behalf of the 27
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are members of our
 
05:26:10.510 --> 05:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition this is why I appear before
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
you to oppose House Bill
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
1686 this bill is an unfair solution to
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
fund education that has been tried
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
before treating similarly situated
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
communities differently will not be well
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
received in our communities throughout
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
the state and will be difficult ult to
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
sustain we have seen this disruptive
 
05:26:36.990 --> 05:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
approach some 20 years ago when
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
so-called donor towns were first created
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately the problems raised by that
 
05:26:46.270 --> 05:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
original funding system were legislated
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
away uh as we just talked about 11 uh in
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
20 uh
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
2011 the policy flaws in this bill
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
mirror the recent State Superior Court
 
05:26:59.788 --> 05:26:59.798 align:start position:0%
decision issued in November that sends
 
05:27:01.948 --> 05:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire Back to the
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
Future that decision which is pending
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
appeal in the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:27:09.788 --> 05:27:09.798 align:start position:0%
Court and this bill creates winners and
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
losers all across the granite state and
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
because there are many variables in the
 
05:27:18.830 --> 05:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
calculation the system that creates
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
these winners and losers can change a
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
community from one side to the other on
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
a year-to-year
 
05:27:29.390 --> 05:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
basis this errant decision and this bill
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
would authorize the State of New
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to take tax money paid by
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in one town and give it to
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
other towns to spend without any
 
05:27:42.190 --> 05:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
accountability to those who paid the
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
taxes that is fundamentally wrong and at
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
odds with how New Hampshire cities and
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
towns have governed themselves for
 
05:27:55.150 --> 05:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
centuries House Bill 1686 creates an
 
05:27:55.160 --> 05:27:56.270 align:start position:0%
centuries House Bill 1686 creates an
unfair

05:27:56.270 --> 05:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
redistribution of property tax revenue
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
this failed policy has been tried before
 
05:28:05.788 --> 05:28:05.798 align:start position:0%
and repealed it did nothing but cause
 
05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
acrimony between our municipalities and
 
05:28:12.030 --> 05:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
help to initiate more wrongheaded
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
lawsuits there is no inherent fairness
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
accountability or fiscal responsibility
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill Coalition communities 2.0
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
appreciates the challenges in addressing
 
05:28:28.350 --> 05:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
school funding in our state we care
 
05:28:30.548 --> 05:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
deeply about ensuring a quality
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
education for our children and we will
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%

05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to education
 
05:28:42.510 --> 05:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
funding in New Hampshire working with
 
05:28:45.030 --> 05:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislators Community leaders and the
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
general public our members are confident
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
that an appropriate resolution can be
 
05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
developed that does not treat
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
neighboring towns disproportionately or
 
05:28:58.350 --> 05:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
differently thank you Mr chairman I'll

your in your testimony but there's one
 
05:29:20.350 --> 05:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
item I'd like to ask you about when you
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
said you're committed to uh to working
 
05:29:23.840 --> 05:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
said you're committed to uh to working
to

05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:28.590 --> 05:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
find a fair and comprehensive approach
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
to funding Public Schools
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
um could you tell us a little bit more
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
about what's behind that commitment and
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
um and how do we know that that
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
commitment is um is
 
05:29:47.230 --> 05:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
reached the the commitment is to find
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
ways uh to utilize State resources not
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
local property taxes um the the fact of
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
the formula that we use can actually
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
change communities from donor
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
communities to receiver communities year
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
to year as I said um our commitment is
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
to just try to find ways to utilize
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
other state resources to do this and a
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
followup and so so success would be
 
05:30:21.070 --> 05:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
finding a solution not sorry there's no
 
05:30:23.590 --> 05:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
good Solutions Left Right corre would be
 
05:30:27.030 --> 05:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
finding a solution yes right thank you
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
correct further
 
05:30:29.240 --> 05:30:30.868 align:start position:0%
correct further
questions

05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%

much thank you Mr chairman I'd like to
 
05:30:38.350 --> 05:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.868 --> 05:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
Hall U Mr chairman I have a a copies
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
again a couple tables in
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
here so it's helpful if members
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
can see those because I'm going to refer
 
05:30:54.718 --> 05:30:59.150 align:start position:0%
can see those because I'm going to refer
to

05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:03.868 --> 05:31:03.878 align:start position:0%
them thank you Mr chairman um I'm here
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
as a private citizen uh but somebody
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
who's been deeply involved in school of
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
finances I've explained before uh here
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
1686 and in my testimony I'd like to
 
05:31:19.868 --> 05:31:19.878 align:start position:0%
just go through this the bill the
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
language in the bill uh prohibits the
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
setting of negative quote local
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
education or County tax rates there's
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
some Ang ambiguity in that term local
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Revenue
 
05:31:37.708 --> 05:31:37.718 align:start position:0%
Administration which sets the rates uses
 
05:31:41.548 --> 05:31:41.558 align:start position:0%
the term local only with local education
 
05:31:44.110 --> 05:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
they use the term Municipal for
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
municipal tax rates town and city tax
 
05:31:50.510 --> 05:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
rates as long as Dr interprets the
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
Bill's word local to include Municipal
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
as well as local education tax rates
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
then the Bill's okay but if ER
 
05:32:04.110 --> 05:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
interprets local to mean only local
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
education then the bill needs to be
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
amended to add municiple that's my first
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
point second point on page two of the
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
Bill's fiscal note and so I sort of
 
05:32:20.190 --> 05:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
direct you there but Dr states that the
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill would quote result in an
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in Revenue to
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
the state ETF the education trust
 
05:32:29.040 --> 05:32:30.948 align:start position:0%
the state ETF the education trust
fund

05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
Dr does not
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
understand that the full amount of the
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax swep
 
05:32:41.948 --> 05:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
the full
 
05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
amount is already included in the
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
education trust funds revenue and the uh
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
the second table the third page of my
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
testimony shows this this document on
 
05:33:02.110 --> 05:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
the third page is from page
 
05:33:05.948 --> 05:33:05.958 align:start position:0%

05:33:05.958 --> 05:33:07.270 align:start position:0%

year
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
2023 and I've noted on the top this
 
05:33:21.070 --> 05:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
chart is for the education trust fund
 
05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
every year from 2014 to
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
2023 and in the top you'll note that in
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
2023 it has $63 mil
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
98,000 of Revenue that's the full amount
 
05:33:37.160 --> 05:33:38.708 align:start position:0%
98,000 of Revenue that's the full amount
including

05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
including
 
05:33:42.190 --> 05:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
what Coalition communities keep that
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
goes beyond adequate education it's the
 
05:33:45.040 --> 05:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
goes beyond adequate education it's the
full

05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
full
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
amount it's already in the education
 
05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
trust fund down further about halfway
 
05:33:56.510 --> 05:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
down the page you'll see under
 
05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations the adequate education
 
05:34:00.430 --> 05:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
grant to
 
05:34:04.750 --> 05:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
which is the money from the swept is
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
identically equal to the amount of the
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
revenue so the state books contrary to
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
what Dr says in the fiscal note already
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
include the revenue and the
 
05:34:22.110 --> 05:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
expenses and here's the final point
 
05:34:22.120 --> 05:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
expenses and here's the final point
about

05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:34:27.310 --> 05:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
this that 263 million or in the prior
 
05:34:32.110 --> 05:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
years the 363 million is being paid out
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund if you go
 
05:34:36.910 --> 05:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
to my last
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
page this is the text of RSA
 
05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
19839 that defines what monies can be
 
05:34:48.390 --> 05:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
spent from the education trust
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
fund monies and such funds shall not be
 
05:34:55.150 --> 05:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
used for any purpose other than and then
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
there are 14 purposes the first
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
one to distribute adequate education
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
grants to
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts
 
05:35:09.190 --> 05:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 19842 what that means is
 
05:35:12.750 --> 05:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's the adequacy amount so the
 
05:35:16.750 --> 05:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund can
 
05:35:20.070 --> 05:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
legally send back if you will I'm not
 
05:35:21.990 --> 05:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
talking about where the cash goes but in
 
05:35:25.628 --> 05:35:25.638 align:start position:0%
the bookkeeping to the to all the
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
communities the amount they paid for
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy the amount that the Coalition
 
05:35:35.230 --> 05:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
communities get that goes beyond
 
05:35:38.150 --> 05:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy there's no Authority for it
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
being spent here in RSA
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
9839 so all these
 
05:35:48.430 --> 05:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
years the state has not been complying
 
05:35:48.440 --> 05:35:50.948 align:start position:0%
years the state has not been complying
with

05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.430 --> 05:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
19839 now I'll go back to the question
 
05:35:54.440 --> 05:35:56.510 align:start position:0%
19839 now I'll go back to the question
of

05:35:56.510 --> 05:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
the negative tax rates which
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have no idea even
 
05:36:04.350 --> 05:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
happened but it's been going on for
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
decades so the second page the table on
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
my second
 
05:36:14.708 --> 05:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
page is these unincorporated
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
locations that have been awarded
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
negative tax rates for years and the
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
negative tax rates I've shown here in
 
05:36:26.110 --> 05:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
Red so took me a little extra time to
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
get a color printer to do it but
 
05:36:30.030 --> 05:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I wanted to make make sure
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
you could see negative tax rates so I
 
05:36:35.910 --> 05:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
just want to point out one thing I'll
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
use an example go down to
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
dicksville dicksville notch
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay there is $31 million of property in
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
dixville now the bossoms is one big
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
piece of that okay and if you look they
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
have a negative Municipal rate of
 
05:37:03.548 --> 05:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
$33 which offsets the county rate of
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
$342 so that in essence those properties
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
in dicksville are paying only 39 cents
 
05:37:13.708 --> 05:37:13.718 align:start position:0%
tax rate to the
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
county because they've offset it with a
 
05:37:19.670 --> 05:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
negative Municipal rate the balsams is
 
05:37:23.868 --> 05:37:23.878 align:start position:0%
not paying Coos County its property
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
tax if you go further across dicksville
 
05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
05:37:33.628 --> 05:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
the uh State education tax
 
05:37:36.670 --> 05:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
rate of 38
 
05:37:40.350 --> 05:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
cents and the local education tax rate
 
05:37:43.628 --> 05:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
of a negative 52
 
05:37:46.750 --> 05:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
cents in total in the final right hand
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
column I'm showing how much money was
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
raised by the local education tax
 
05:37:52.558 --> 05:37:53.548 align:start position:0%
raised by the local education tax
actually

05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:37:57.390 --> 05:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
$16,000 was essentially sent back to
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the taxpayers were
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
responsible only for 11,000 the third
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
column from the right $11,800 in taxes
 
05:38:10.270 --> 05:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
so the properties in dixville paid
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
nothing for the education of any student
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire under
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
swept not only that but they also didn't
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
pay Coos County this is the craziness of
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
the way swept is being administered and
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
it's the reason in addition to the fact
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
the court found the same thing that I'm
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
here supporting this Bill thank you
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you for the sheets you
 
05:38:42.958 --> 05:38:44.030 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you for the sheets you
provided

05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
fellows welcome
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so now I'll
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
tell you a different version
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
of history as I remember it um just to
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
address some of the things that that
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
have been said um it it is true
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um that for a short time that towns
 
05:39:19.510 --> 05:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
did remit excess to the state and my
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
recollection of it was it is that it was
 
05:39:24.510 --> 05:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
only for a couple of years and I'm
 
05:39:29.948 --> 05:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
positive that that ended way before 2011
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
like it might have been um 2005 or six
 
05:39:38.110 --> 05:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
something like that also I can tell you
 
05:39:38.120 --> 05:39:40.230 align:start position:0%
something like that also I can tell you
that

05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
um it may have been connected to the to
 
05:39:47.190 --> 05:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
the uh I don't recall exactly why it
 
05:39:51.270 --> 05:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
stopped being sent in what I do remember
 
05:39:54.990 --> 05:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
is that there was an RSA adopted I think
 
05:39:57.430 --> 05:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
it was something within something that
 
05:40:01.590 --> 05:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
Senator gatsis had in a bill related to
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
school funding and what it said is that
 
05:40:09.628 --> 05:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
any excess had to be spent on
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
education so that meant it could be
 
05:40:17.468 --> 05:40:17.478 align:start position:0%
funding the um school budget obviously
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
we all know adequate education Aid has
 
05:40:23.230 --> 05:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
never covered the full cost of a of
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
educating the students in any District
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that money that excess could be spent
 
05:40:29.760 --> 05:40:31.548 align:start position:0%
so that money that excess could be spent
on

05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:40:34.030 --> 05:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
local part of the school budget I mean
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's all there is to it so and um that
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
statute I don't think it's in there
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
anymore at some point it got it got U
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
repealed and so I think it probably got
 
05:40:45.680 --> 05:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
repealed and so I think it probably got
repealed

05:40:47.430 --> 05:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
05:40:47.440 --> 05:40:48.990 align:start position:0%
repealed
sometime

05:40:48.990 --> 05:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
after 2017 because that's when I stopped
 
05:40:55.310 --> 05:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
working in the at the Department of
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
Education but my original testimony
 
05:41:02.590 --> 05:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
was going to go over the history a
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
little bit and um just to say that and I
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
can give you some of this in writing
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
when I can go upstairs and get a copy of
 
05:41:13.788 --> 05:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
it that U 25 years ago the Supreme Court
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
ruled that the state needed to
 
05:41:17.948 --> 05:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
significantly increase funding to school
 
05:41:20.468 --> 05:41:20.478 align:start position:0%
districts the state quickly put together
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
a new funding plan that on paper showed
 
05:41:27.468 --> 05:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
a significant increase part of that
 
05:41:31.548 --> 05:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
increase was simply to take each Town's
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
property tax assessment for schools and
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
break it into two pieces one piece
 
05:41:40.830 --> 05:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
remained labeled as a local school
 
05:41:43.948 --> 05:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
property tax and the new piece was
 
05:41:48.390 --> 05:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
labeled State education tax the total
 
05:41:50.708 --> 05:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
property taxations for those school
 
05:41:53.788 --> 05:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
districts did not change at all they're
 
05:41:56.468 --> 05:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
to the bottom line of their tax bill
 
05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
this part this action did not Chang the
 
05:42:03.310 --> 05:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
bottom line of their tax bill no new
 
05:42:07.868 --> 05:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue was raised from property taxes
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
because the sum of these two pieces were
 
05:42:10.638 --> 05:42:11.590 align:start position:0%
because the sum of these two pieces were
the

05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
same so SE swep has
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
been simply a mechanism it it was
 
05:42:21.750 --> 05:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
developed simply as a mechanism to
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of real cash payments
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
to school districts so it looks on looks
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
on paper is if the state is paying or
 
05:42:36.190 --> 05:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
you know over $300 million more of the
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
cost of Education when in fact it's
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
really the property taxpayers that were
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
initially paying that money and are
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
still paying that money of the one
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
exception being to these these really
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
tiny places the ones that have no
 
05:42:52.150 --> 05:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
students at all which I that applies to
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
everything I say so I'm just not going
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
to keep saying over and over
 
05:42:59.230 --> 05:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
again so I want you to keep in mind what
 
05:43:01.590 --> 05:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
was the original intent when you're
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
considering what you want to do with
 
05:43:07.310 --> 05:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and also I hope that you will
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
remember that there are rich and poor
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
people living in every single town and
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
property tax there are rich and poor
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
property tax payers and there are and as
 
05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
we hear every day there are people who
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford to buy a home and they and
 
05:43:27.390 --> 05:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to buy their pay their
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes prot particularly if
 
05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
they're seniors and they're living in
 
05:43:33.670 --> 05:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
these homes that they paid off the
 
05:43:37.468 --> 05:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
mortgage a long time ago and now they're
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
property tax bill has been gone has gone
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
up because it's been reassessed and
 
05:43:48.390 --> 05:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
shifted with the reassessment shouldn't
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
hypothetically increase tax bills but
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
when it's shifted between different
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
components of property for example um
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
businesses during covid nobody wanted to
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
buy buildings that that were for retail
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
or for for um con you know um for
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
businesses people didn't want to make
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
more buy more office space it made the
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
home values go up so one class of
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
property the pro the value goes down the
 
05:44:26.110 --> 05:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
second another class goes up so you know
 
05:44:26.120 --> 05:44:27.230 align:start position:0%
second another class goes up so you know
it's

05:44:27.230 --> 05:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
05:44:38.150 --> 05:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
is um not very well connected to the
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
ability of who pays it and their their
 
05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
financial um ability to pay those
 
05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
taxes I also want to tell you so that's
 
05:44:53.190 --> 05:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
my my um speech in terms of
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
purpose and now I just wanted to go over
 
05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
some of the technical issues so what I
 
05:45:02.230 --> 05:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
would tell you about the negative tax
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
rate is that you really can't get rid of
 
05:45:06.750 --> 05:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
that and and frankly you shouldn't be
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that there are
 
05:45:11.948 --> 05:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
reasons other than education that you
 
05:45:15.150 --> 05:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
could have a negative tax rate um one of
 
05:45:16.788 --> 05:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
the things could happen in a really
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
small town and I've seen this happen is
 
05:45:25.230 --> 05:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
that they um they have a a lot of forest
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
land and when it's cut they have to pay
 
05:45:31.270 --> 05:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
a Timber tax to the town and if it's a
 
05:45:33.670 --> 05:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
really tiny town you know with just
 
05:45:36.910 --> 05:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
part-time people you know the the town
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
office is only open one day a week that
 
05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
that Revenue coming in could be more
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
than what their budget is for the
 
05:45:48.670 --> 05:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
municipality and all it can also happen
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
with education tax because we have some
 
05:45:55.948 --> 05:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
some places that have they only have one
 
05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
student went worse location for example
 
05:46:03.270 --> 05:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
had might have one student this year and
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
then the next year they don't have a
 
05:46:08.990 --> 05:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
student and adequacy Aid as you know
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
isn't paid on the students the adequacy
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
aid that's being paid up for this school
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
year isn't the money for the students
 
05:46:18.990 --> 05:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
this school year it's the money based on
 
05:46:22.030 --> 05:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
the students that you had last year so
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
if you have no student this year and you
 
05:46:27.868 --> 05:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
did have a student last year that money
 
05:46:30.910 --> 05:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
can come into your school budget
 
05:46:33.468 --> 05:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
hypothetically the budget could be zero
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
because you knew you weren't going to
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
have any students that gives you a
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
negative tax rate because because the
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in is more than the
 
05:46:43.350 --> 05:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures going up that's all
 
05:46:46.510 --> 05:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
negative tax rate is from my perspective
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
Dr they they look at it just from a
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
think uh let's
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
see another another issue
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
that comes up with this bill has to do
 
05:47:02.280 --> 05:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
that comes up with this bill has to do
with

05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
timing so you could
 
05:47:11.468 --> 05:47:11.478 align:start position:0%
have um a district that didn't think
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
they were going to have any excess that
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
they had to remit back to the state
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
because in March they voted on their
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
school budget but they're not going to
 
05:47:22.360 --> 05:47:23.430 align:start position:0%
school budget but they're not going to
find

05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
find
 
05:47:23.440 --> 05:47:25.830 align:start position:0%
find
out

05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:47:25.840 --> 05:47:27.468 align:start position:0%
out
until

05:47:27.468 --> 05:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
September I not sure if I even have the
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
right year they're not going to find out
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
until um September for sure how much
 
05:47:36.750 --> 05:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy that they're going to get and
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
if they're going to have excess or not
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so they didn't plan on having to
 
05:47:46.990 --> 05:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
send that money back so that's that can
 
05:47:50.070 --> 05:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
definitely create a problem for them how
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
how are they going to change how what
 
05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
are they going to do and you heard Mark
 
05:47:59.510 --> 05:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
talk talk earlier about the crunch
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that he can get into
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
when the statute that
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
says districts can change their they can
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
have a special hearing I think it is to
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
change their budget but if if the
 
05:48:20.310 --> 05:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid formula is changed so you
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
can have that going on at the same time
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
then they find out they have an exess
 
05:48:25.868 --> 05:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
you really have a time crunch in ter in
 
05:48:27.670 --> 05:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
terms of like how you're going to get
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
those property test tax bills out in the
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
normal time frame which is around
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
November let's
 
05:48:43.390 --> 05:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
see I I this is my personal thought is
 
05:48:46.270 --> 05:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
that if this is really a state property
 
05:48:48.830 --> 05:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
tax then the state should be sending
 
05:48:51.990 --> 05:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
bills to the property tax owner this is
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
kind of operating like the right now
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
like or the proposal is that the state
 
05:49:01.070 --> 05:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
sends a property tax bill to the
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
municipality but really it's property
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are paying that money um
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
so what happens when somebody doesn't
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
pay all their taxes on time you know
 
05:49:16.948 --> 05:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
that happens every single town and
 
05:49:18.910 --> 05:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes people pay part of their
 
05:49:20.590 --> 05:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
property tax they can't afford the whole
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
thing they pay part of it that's a good
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
start so how are you going to figure out
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
how much of that is swep money that
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
excess that's supposed to go back to the
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
state and that's a problem what's been
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
going on historically of course we all
 
05:49:42.430 --> 05:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
know that swep really that it's that
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a tax it it's not a tax well
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
let's see some people call it a virtual
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
tax some people call it a phantom tax I
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
like to call it smoke and
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
mirrors because the money doesn't really
 
05:50:00.990 --> 05:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
go out and it doesn't really come back
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
come in it's just on paper and it's
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
always 363 million exactly the same
 
05:50:05.520 --> 05:50:06.948 align:start position:0%
always 363 million exactly the same
dollar

05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
amount so
 
05:50:13.708 --> 05:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh I think I'll stop
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
there well thank you very much
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows lot of
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
information there uh are there any
 
05:50:23.030 --> 05:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.718 --> 05:50:45.150 align:start position:0%
 
something

05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon chairman lad and
 
05:50:49.230 --> 05:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I hope
 
05:50:50.670 --> 05:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me just a little bit I
 
05:50:52.670 --> 05:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
want to talk briefly about this bill and
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
a couple others you heard earlier I'm
 
05:50:57.468 --> 05:50:57.478 align:start position:0%
going to start from a a much higher up
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint and not get a lot into the
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
tax details um because that really is
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
not my uh area of expertise I want to
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
talk about constitutional rights and
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
obligations because this is all about
 
05:51:09.600 --> 05:51:10.708 align:start position:0%
obligations because this is all about
educating

05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
educating
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
students in the grite state every graned
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
state child has the constitutional right
 
05:51:22.590 --> 05:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
to a robust public
 
05:51:25.270 --> 05:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
education it is the Constitutional
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
obligation of the state to provide the
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity for that through
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
funding the public district schools so
 
05:51:34.830 --> 05:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
that that can be
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
provided um and it is the incredibly
 
05:51:40.868 --> 05:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
complex duty of you all to figure out
 
05:51:43.390 --> 05:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
how to make that happen um that's not
 
05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
just my opinion that is the result of
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know what written in our
 
05:51:48.910 --> 05:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the findings of
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
numerous court cases over the past
 
05:51:50.478 --> 05:51:51.708 align:start position:0%
numerous court cases over the past
several

05:51:51.708 --> 05:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
decades we should have an equally robust
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a public
 
05:52:01.468 --> 05:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
education in Franklin Claremont and
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
Merlin as we have in Bedford Windham and
 
05:52:06.670 --> 05:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
Handover we should not have situations
 
05:52:09.310 --> 05:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
where you have public high schools who
 
05:52:09.320 --> 05:52:10.708 align:start position:0%
where you have public high schools who
cannot

05:52:10.708 --> 05:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
get live teachers to teach geometry and
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
algebra too because the pay scale is so
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
low and the classes are so crowded that
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
they have to do virtual classes with the
 
05:52:24.948 --> 05:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
Community College which is you know a
 
05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
great workaround solution but it's not
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
the same as having a live person to
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
teach the class we uh when you have
 
05:52:35.350 --> 05:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
other high schools that have multiple
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
advanced placement math classes
 
05:52:39.390 --> 05:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
available that's not fair to our
 
05:52:43.150 --> 05:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
students it's not an equal opportunity
 
05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
for a public
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
education so you have a huge challenge
 
05:52:50.030 --> 05:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
in front of you to try and meet that so
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
that every student in the granite state
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
can get an equally robust opportunity
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
for that public education now there were
 
05:53:01.468 --> 05:53:01.478 align:start position:0%
bills today about different approaches
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
and again we've had experts in here
 
05:53:07.110 --> 05:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the merits of each and you
 
05:53:09.190 --> 05:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
know different bill as it came up the
 
05:53:13.628 --> 05:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
one we were just listening to um HB 1686
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
with the Statewide education property
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
tax we would be in favor of that bill
 
05:53:22.390 --> 05:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
based on on the court ruling on the Rand
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
case because it
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
addresses the um disproportion Pate
 
05:53:31.150 --> 05:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
impact the current Statewide property
 
05:53:34.990 --> 05:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
tax is having on property taxpayers in
 
05:53:37.628 --> 05:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
different communities that's one issue
 
05:53:42.230 --> 05:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
education earlier you heard HB 1533
 
05:53:47.468 --> 05:53:47.478 align:start position:0%
which would increase the per pupil as
 
05:53:49.830 --> 05:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
quy Grant to
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
$110,000 I understand that would be a
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing to do given our
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
state finances but it also would go a
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
long way towards helping make sure that
 
05:54:02.510 --> 05:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
every student gets the education they
 
05:54:05.430 --> 05:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional right to and
 
05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's what this really should be about
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
what do students need what do they
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
deserve because they have a
 
05:54:13.230 --> 05:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to it we would
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
support that hb1 1656 would increase the
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
um the aid for special education
 
05:54:25.230 --> 05:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
students to $27,000 when I first saw
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I was amazed but yes that is
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
basically accurate as an average it's
 
05:54:33.468 --> 05:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
actually just a little bit under what it
 
05:54:36.190 --> 05:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
costs if you average all the costs of
 
05:54:37.868 --> 05:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
special education divided by the number
 
05:54:40.150 --> 05:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
of students receiving special education
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
services and those are the costs that
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
can break town and District budgets so
 
05:54:50.910 --> 05:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
we would be in support of HB 1656 we
 
05:54:52.030 --> 05:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
understand not all of these are going to
 
05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
pass they can't all be funded but what
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
we're really urging you to do is to work
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
hard on these and find a way to come
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
closer to meeting the state's obligation
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
to all of our
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
students and fulfilling their
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to get a robust
 
05:55:16.910 --> 05:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
public education no matter which city or
 
05:55:19.910 --> 05:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
town they live in in the state now is
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
the time to meet the constit
 
05:55:23.468 --> 05:55:23.478 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Duty for fully funding
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for robust public
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
education for All graned State students
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
every student in the granite state
 
05:55:32.310 --> 05:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
deserves a welcoming inclusive classroom
 
05:55:34.350 --> 05:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
where they can learn grow and Thrive
 
05:55:36.670 --> 05:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
with small class sizes individual
 
05:55:38.070 --> 05:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
attention from a teacher learning
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
support from par
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
Educators uh the chance for experiential
 
05:55:46.030 --> 05:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
learning a challenging curriculum so
 
05:55:48.430 --> 05:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
they can experience the joy of learning
 
05:55:51.548 --> 05:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
and the spark um you know to grow and
 
05:55:54.390 --> 05:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
learn and become the best they can be so
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
we just really urge you to dig in and
 
05:55:58.430 --> 05:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
make progress on this
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
for the sake of all of our students and
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you are there any
 
05:56:04.548 --> 05:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
 
05:56:07.708 --> 05:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
members I see thank you very much uh
 
05:56:07.718 --> 05:56:19.628 align:start position:0%
members I see thank you very much uh
Katherine

05:56:19.628 --> 05:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
heck thank you chairman lad and members
 
05:56:23.390 --> 05:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee I don't often have the
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
privilege of coming before you my name
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
is Katherine heck for the record and I
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
Association or the 234 cities and towns
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and normally we do not
 
05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
get involved in education and I'm here
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be very clear that we have no
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
position on um a a good part of this
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
bill and that we don't take a position
 
05:56:45.628 --> 05:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
on the swept how it's assess the excess
 
05:56:48.590 --> 05:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
that is um well beyond my pay grade
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
however the negative tax rate that this
 
05:56:53.948 --> 05:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
brings forward and not being able to
 
05:56:56.670 --> 05:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
assess a negative rate um in the local
 
05:57:00.110 --> 05:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
County or State education I I will Echo
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellow sentiments in
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
that we are concerned that there are
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
possibilities that a town could in fact
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
have a negative tax rate and as you see
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
your tax bills you're all taxpayers here
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there's four components
 
05:57:16.990 --> 05:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
to your bill the State education which
 
05:57:19.468 --> 05:57:19.478 align:start position:0%
we're not here to talk about the local
 
05:57:22.070 --> 05:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
education the municipal and the county
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
all of those rates have different
 
05:57:26.750 --> 05:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
governing bodies bringing forward those
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
budgets and those appr corations and the
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
offsetting revenues and they are all set
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
and calculated differently they all have
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
their own formula the concern is that
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
there could be very real reasons why a
 
05:57:42.430 --> 05:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
municipal rate could need to be negative
 
05:57:44.590 --> 05:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the committee to
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
entertain that of the four rates if each
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
were a dollar and your tax bill as a
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is a dollar right you're going
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
to pay that over to your town tax
 
05:57:55.230 --> 05:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
collector they are responsible for
 
05:57:56.948 --> 05:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
collecting all of the taxes for the
 
05:57:56.958 --> 05:57:58.270 align:start position:0%
collecting all of the taxes for the
community

05:57:58.270 --> 05:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:58:00.510 --> 05:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
now if the according to this bill if the
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
rate for the town could not go negative
 
05:58:06.548 --> 05:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
but I had some huge influx of Revenue
 
05:58:08.430 --> 05:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
let's just for example say that a
 
05:58:10.430 --> 05:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
benefactor left the town double the
 
05:58:12.868 --> 05:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
operating budget with the sole purpose
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
of offsetting taxes that year so I've
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
getting all of this wonderful revenue
 
05:58:18.670 --> 05:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
and for two years we don't have to pay
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
taxes and I can only go to zero you're
 
05:58:24.468 --> 05:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
all paying $3 but I have that Revenue
 
05:58:26.190 --> 05:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
right I have that Revenue if I can do a
 
05:58:28.468 --> 05:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
negative tax rate what you would all be
 
05:58:30.910 --> 05:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
paying is $2 because each of the
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions even though we
 
05:58:35.070 --> 05:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
collect on behalf we perfect that system
 
05:58:37.510 --> 05:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the county and the school
 
05:58:39.548 --> 05:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
districts and we pay it over that
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
obligation right we we would have that
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue somewhere else so not only in an
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
accounting practice I'm not sure how we
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
would account for Zero versus a negative
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
because I'd have all of this offsetting
 
05:58:52.590 --> 05:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue in this pile over here so for
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and the taxpayer themselves
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
we do believe that there are very few
 
05:58:59.190 --> 05:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
cases in which in negative rate is
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
reasonable and possible and the the tax
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
rate should be reflected um
 
05:59:06.670 --> 05:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately because each of the
 
05:59:08.990 --> 05:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions again one doesn't offset
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
the other so a negative rate on the on
 
05:59:14.110 --> 05:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
the county or on the municipality
 
05:59:16.030 --> 05:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't offset somebody else that
 
05:59:18.670 --> 05:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to that other entity based on
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
their budget and their revenues is still
 
05:59:23.830 --> 05:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
paid over in full to them it only would
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
affect however the Dr sets the rate the
 
05:59:28.510 --> 05:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
05:59:31.070 --> 05:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
or the state although I've never seen a
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
swept negative tax rate um it would only
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
affect that one entity that one taxing
 
05:59:38.190 --> 05:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
entity so it's just important to
 
05:59:39.990 --> 05:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
consider that negative tax rates are
 
05:59:42.270 --> 05:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
possible and there are two in fact this
 
05:59:44.788 --> 05:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
year um so we would like you to
 
05:59:46.430 --> 05:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
contemplate that in your all your
 
05:59:48.390 --> 05:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
considerations because we want the bills
 
05:59:50.468 --> 05:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
to be accurate for the taxpayer
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
themselves so that's all I have if you
 
05:59:54.510 --> 05:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you are there
 
05:59:54.520 --> 05:59:55.350 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you are there
any

05:59:55.350 --> 05:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions not see any thank you very
 
05:59:57.360 --> 05:59:59.788 align:start position:0%
questions not see any thank you very
much

05:59:59.788 --> 05:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.798 --> 06:00:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
Andrew

06:00:16.990 --> 06:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
valinski good afternoon Andrew binsky
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
from East conquered for the record uh
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh committee
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
members um over decades long experience
 
06:00:32.350 --> 06:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
in the state I've learned never to
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with representative Smith nor
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
to try to expand on her testimony um so
 
06:00:41.070 --> 06:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
I shall avoid both and adopt her
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
position uh I will say I um was pleased
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
to hear the commitment of the Coalition
 
06:00:53.708 --> 06:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
communities to finding a solution to
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
education funding that does not involve
 
06:00:59.070 --> 06:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
a Statewide property tax and I'll be
 
06:01:01.310 --> 06:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
happy to work with them when they come
 
06:01:04.590 --> 06:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
out with their income or sales tax bills
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the near
 
06:01:10.468 --> 06:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
future it has been
 
06:01:14.030 --> 06:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
decades since we have had a Statewide
 
06:01:16.468 --> 06:01:16.478 align:start position:0%
property tax and the issue of what
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
happens to the excess in those decades
 
06:01:23.350 --> 06:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
the communities who we call wealthy
 
06:01:25.868 --> 06:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
communities they call themselves
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
donors have never never never to my
 
06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
recollection supported any methodology
 
06:01:38.110 --> 06:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
publicly to resolve school funding
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
issues so I'm happy to learn today that
 
06:01:42.150 --> 06:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to jump on board with
 
06:01:45.548 --> 06:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
either income or sales tax um one point
 
06:01:49.310 --> 06:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
I want to make is that with respect to
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
the Statewide property tax to fund
 
06:01:56.468 --> 06:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
education that tax is dedicated to
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
funding the state's portion of Education
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we all call education
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
adequacy the Dr sets negative rates in
 
06:02:12.270 --> 06:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
communities that do not have local
 
06:02:12.280 --> 06:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
communities that do not have local
education

06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:02:18.030 --> 06:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
expenses so that the negative local
 
06:02:22.350 --> 06:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
education offsets the positive Statewide
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
property tax which is now about A1 a.
 
06:02:24.638 --> 06:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
property tax which is now about A1 a.
half

06:02:25.830 --> 06:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
half
 
06:02:29.948 --> 06:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
th000 the idea that you only pay for
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
your own kids or you don't pay anything
 
06:02:35.110 --> 06:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
because you don't have your own children
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
in schools flies in the face of the idea
 
06:02:42.030 --> 06:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
that this is a state tax to support the
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide program of Education which is
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy that is what
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
judge ruol was getting at I am
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
co-counsel in the Rand case judge ruoff
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
granted our motions on this point about
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
the swept tax
 
06:02:59.788 --> 06:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
and that's what we were all talking
 
06:03:02.510 --> 06:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
about it's not about whether you have a
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
Timber tax Bonanza one one particular
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
year I'm not aware of anyone who's
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
bequeathed twice the municipal budget to
 
06:03:16.350 --> 06:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
any municipality in recent history I
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
suppose that could happen that's not
 
06:03:21.868 --> 06:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
what this is about this is about using
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
local education negative tax rates to
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
keep keep communities that don't have
 
06:03:32.788 --> 06:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
local expenses from contributing to the
 
06:03:35.510 --> 06:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
state's Bill and that is
 
06:03:39.390 --> 06:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as found by judge ruof
 
06:03:42.468 --> 06:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
um the final point I would make is
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
collecting the money from the negative
 
06:03:47.350 --> 06:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
communities connect collecting the
 
06:03:49.350 --> 06:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
excess monies from the wealthy
 
06:03:53.070 --> 06:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
communities results in about a 2425
 
06:03:54.990 --> 06:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
million pot of
 
06:03:59.948 --> 06:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
money that money can go to fund things
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
like representative
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
AMS enhanced property tax
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
exemption portion of
 
06:04:12.628 --> 06:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
1586 or representative Ames had a
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
another Standalone bill that addresses
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's problem of
 
06:04:21.548 --> 06:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
lowincome taxpayers who happen to live
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
in property wealthy communities you get
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
at that not by allowing them to keep
 
06:04:30.390 --> 06:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
exess which is not their money you get
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
at that by adopting appropriate levels
 
06:04:36.270 --> 06:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
of exemptions from the Statewide
 
06:04:39.670 --> 06:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
property tax based on Limited in income
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a process that we do as Zach Sheen
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning it's a process
 
06:04:46.590 --> 06:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's underfunded only about a million
 
06:04:50.350 --> 06:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
dollars of exemption happens now that
 
06:04:53.230 --> 06:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
amount can be boosted using the money
 
06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
that now comes back into the education
 
06:04:59.310 --> 06:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund with appropriate amendment to
 
06:05:02.590 --> 06:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
19840 so it can be used there the other
 
06:05:05.310 --> 06:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
thing we've heard about targeting Aid
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
the state does not have a good track
 
06:05:10.830 --> 06:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
record of targeted Aid
 
06:05:15.390 --> 06:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
programs the 24 25 million could also be
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
used to create a targeted aid program
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
outside of adequacy say to fund
 
06:05:21.840 --> 06:05:23.070 align:start position:0%
outside of adequacy say to fund
Universal

06:05:23.070 --> 06:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
preschool or to enhance literacy
 
06:05:28.670 --> 06:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
programs in the state's neediest
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
communities so that we do have positive
 
06:05:34.708 --> 06:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
experiences with targeted Aid before we
 
06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
throw the baby out with the bath water
 
06:05:38.708 --> 06:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
so those are the couple of points I I
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to make make I thank the co the
 
06:05:43.468 --> 06:05:43.478 align:start position:0%

06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
um support of an income tax or sales tax
 
06:06:18.390 --> 06:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
do you believe the funding um changes um
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
would require an income or sales tax I
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
think you can do it with Statewide
 
06:06:26.670 --> 06:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
property tax you can do it with an
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
income tax you could do it with a sales
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
tax you could rearrange the business
 
06:06:34.430 --> 06:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
taxes all of the above or just one or
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
two of the above so I I think there are
 
06:06:40.350 --> 06:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
lots of policy Alternatives um New
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just to give us
 
06:06:47.788 --> 06:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
context New Hampshire has the lowest per
 
06:06:52.670 --> 06:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
capita tax level of any state in New
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
England we are the
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
lowest but
 
06:07:01.708 --> 06:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
we are the most reliant on the property
 
06:07:05.190 --> 06:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
tax and the property tax as we've heard
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
is a regressive inelastic tax that's why
 
06:07:11.230 --> 06:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
people lose their homes because their
 
06:07:15.310 --> 06:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
income goes down but their taxes go up
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
highest in the nation for funding
 
06:07:19.708 --> 06:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
schools based on property
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
taxes actually a fairly modest tax level
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
of State Municipal Taxes
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
overall I hope that's
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
responsive represent beler can't see you
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
testimony here um you mentioned the
 
06:07:39.230 --> 06:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
number 24 million is what this could
 
06:07:42.190 --> 06:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
stand to bring uh into the the state
 
06:07:45.510 --> 06:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
funds to then be distributed out to less
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
wealthy districts places that need more
 
06:07:53.788 --> 06:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
help but given that this is giving local
 
06:07:56.070 --> 06:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh towns basically an ultimatum that
 
06:07:57.270 --> 06:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to use these funds are
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
going to lose
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
them does that not seem rather unlikely
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
that they're going to choose to not
 
06:08:06.510 --> 06:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
expend These funds at their local
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
schools and actually kick them back to
 
06:08:08.160 --> 06:08:09.430 align:start position:0%
schools and actually kick them back to
the

06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:08:11.708 --> 06:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
state um thank thank you for the
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
question I I I think your question to me
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
I I apologize for
 
06:08:19.750 --> 06:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
the the machine in the way uh your
 
06:08:21.788 --> 06:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
question to me representative beler and
 
06:08:23.390 --> 06:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
similar to the question you asked
 
06:08:26.990 --> 06:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh respectfully
 
06:08:29.468 --> 06:08:29.478 align:start position:0%
misunderstands what we're talking
 
06:08:33.150 --> 06:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
about this isn't a question of a
 
06:08:37.150 --> 06:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
discretionary spend by a local school
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
district the state in its wisdom has
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
described a formula that we've talked
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
about this morning 4,100 for base
 
06:08:50.830 --> 06:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy 2,300 for special ed something
 
06:08:53.948 --> 06:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
for kids in poverty something that
 
06:08:56.788 --> 06:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
formula when you multiply it times the
 
06:08:59.750 --> 06:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
number of children in attendance in or
 
06:09:02.310 --> 06:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
in Residence in the school district
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
doing the differentiated Aid as it
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
applies gives you a
 
06:09:10.030 --> 06:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
number let's say for Portsmith that
 
06:09:11.190 --> 06:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
number is a
 
06:09:15.948 --> 06:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
100 right the swept tax for Portsmith
 
06:09:18.270 --> 06:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
because it has so much property wealth
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
maybe raises
 
06:09:24.670 --> 06:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
$120 certainly Portsmith wants to spend
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
that 120 but it's it's not ports Smith's
 
06:09:32.468 --> 06:09:32.478 align:start position:0%
money that 100 should be all they get
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the extra 20 should go to the
 
06:09:38.670 --> 06:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for use there so if
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
you add up all those extra $20
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
income that's how you get to 24
 
06:09:49.230 --> 06:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
million I hope that helps if I may just
 
06:09:51.270 --> 06:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify just in case I am making some
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
kind of an error in my understanding of
 
06:09:55.390 --> 06:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
this you're saying that this bill would
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
not allow local towns to spend the money
 
06:10:02.030 --> 06:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they would be required to give that
 
06:10:05.230 --> 06:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
money back to the state what I'm saying
 
06:10:09.070 --> 06:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
is this bill would not allow local
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
communities to spend the state's
 
06:10:16.948 --> 06:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
adequacy money on expenses that are not
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
part of
 
06:10:20.990 --> 06:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy that's all I'm
 
06:10:23.868 --> 06:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
saying and if they can't spend it then
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
the question becomes what happens to it
 
06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
right right now they get to spend it on
 
06:10:32.190 --> 06:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
other educational expenses that you all
 
06:10:35.708 --> 06:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
don't supervise so I don't think anyone
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
thinks a turf football field is part of
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy but under the current system
 
06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
that extra $20 of excess
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
money Tuftonboro can spend that on a
 
06:10:52.510 --> 06:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
turf football field and there's nothing
 
06:10:55.150 --> 06:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
you can say about it that's not the
 
06:10:58.190 --> 06:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
intended purpose of of Statewide
 
06:11:00.670 --> 06:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
property tax and it shouldn't be the
 
06:11:04.910 --> 06:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
allowed use and it's been that way since
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
2011 there was a period of time when it
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't that way and it flipped
 
06:11:13.390 --> 06:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
back and I'm happy to follow up offline
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
if you want but go ahead if I made one
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
more just real quick just because I I
 
06:11:18.510 --> 06:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I really got this down
 
06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that funds money going
 
06:11:23.788 --> 06:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
in is money's fungible could a local
 
06:11:25.390 --> 06:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
District not just say well we're going
 
06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
to build that turf football field and
 
06:11:29.230 --> 06:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to say it was our money from
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
our town portion and we're going to use
 
06:11:33.190 --> 06:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
that State's portion that we would have
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise kicked back to the state and
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that and we're going
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
to call that adequacy which would then
 
06:11:39.868 --> 06:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
again bring up the question of not
 
06:11:44.150 --> 06:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
kicking back that money yeah so um money
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
is fungible but amounts are
 
06:11:51.868 --> 06:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
not and so we know the formula we know
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
how much money each Community should
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
keep under the form
 
06:12:00.430 --> 06:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
and if the application of the Statewide
 
06:12:04.590 --> 06:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
tax in Portsmith or toonbo molten Boro
 
06:12:07.628 --> 06:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
produces more than that amount it's that
 
06:12:10.350 --> 06:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
extra increment that has to come back to
 
06:12:13.948 --> 06:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
the state and the community should be
 
06:12:17.230 --> 06:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
spending the first legitimate amount of
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue on adequacy if it
 
06:12:24.150 --> 06:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't because money is fungible it
 
06:12:26.830 --> 06:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter the question is is
 
06:12:29.390 --> 06:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
how much money are we dealing with and
 
06:12:32.350 --> 06:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
in wealthy communities a dollar and a
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
half raises more than the cost of
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy in those communities that
 
06:12:42.110 --> 06:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
excess is State money this bill makes it
 
06:12:45.590 --> 06:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
come back to the state and corrects uh a
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation that's been
 
06:12:50.910 --> 06:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
going on for 13
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
years are there further represent luno
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
06:12:58.590 --> 06:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
you very much attorney binsky for uh
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
your uh tremendous uh uh work in this uh
 
06:13:04.590 --> 06:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
effort uh going
 
06:13:07.350 --> 06:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
going with Claremont and and all the way
 
06:13:09.548 --> 06:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
through and I really appreciate all of
 
06:13:12.110 --> 06:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
that um all that energy effort and
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
professionalism um that has finally
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
gotten us to this point and hopefully
 
06:13:18.910 --> 06:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be at a position where
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
where we can uh make some moves with it
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
but one of the but one of the things you
 
06:13:26.708 --> 06:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
you locked on to during this discussion
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
was the um was the low and moderate
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
property tax relief fund and So
 
06:13:36.990 --> 06:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently the 25 million is dollars that
 
06:13:40.948 --> 06:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
comprise the excess swept do do any of
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
those dollars benefit
 
06:13:47.310 --> 06:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners in Newport or Charlestown or
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
hopkington or conquered that don't have
 
06:13:52.830 --> 06:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
homes in let's say these excess swats so
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
so even and in particular do they bet
 
06:13:57.948 --> 06:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
does do any of those excess weep dollars
 
06:14:00.270 --> 06:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
benefit lowincome home homeowners in
 
06:14:02.150 --> 06:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
those only very
 
06:14:05.548 --> 06:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
inferentially so so follow up Mr chair M
 
06:14:08.270 --> 06:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
so how would the low and moderate
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
Property Tax Relief Fund affect let's
 
06:14:14.190 --> 06:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
say a homeowner in in Charlestown or in
 
06:14:18.548 --> 06:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
hopkington yeah so the that portion of
 
06:14:22.468 --> 06:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
your bill um increases or raises the
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
income level that makes people eligible
 
06:14:31.468 --> 06:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
for exemption or relief from uh the
 
06:14:35.350 --> 06:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax uh it's not
 
06:14:38.590 --> 06:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
different than other exemptions um we
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
exempt veterans we exempt lowincome
 
06:14:44.430 --> 06:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
people from other taxes and it
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes the inelastic aspect of
 
06:14:50.948 --> 06:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
property taxes and tries to correct for
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
that by saying if you happen to be low
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
income and you could be low income this
 
06:14:55.840 --> 06:14:57.070 align:start position:0%
income and you could be low income this
year

06:14:57.070 --> 06:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:15:00.350 --> 06:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
and not be low income next year we're
 
06:15:02.270 --> 06:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to help you out we're not going to
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
put you out of your home because you
 
06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
can't pay your property tax bill so it's
 
06:15:11.190 --> 06:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate thing right now that
 
06:15:14.590 --> 06:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
24 million doesn't get used in that way
 
06:15:18.910 --> 06:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
I agree that that is an appropriate use
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
for that money and I I'd be tickled to
 
06:15:25.070 --> 06:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
see it uh deployed in that way so and
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
one more followup on on that cuz I I I
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
want to make sure and we didn't plan
 
06:15:32.868 --> 06:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
this no no we didn't we didn't um but
 
06:15:34.510 --> 06:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned the Veteran's
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
exemption which I believe is an o that
 
06:15:40.468 --> 06:15:40.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away no no but which I
 
06:15:42.510 --> 06:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
believe is an
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
overlay yes we're talking the latter
 
06:15:46.910 --> 06:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
part yeah we are it's all related to
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
that it's in the tax section yeah um the
 
06:15:52.510 --> 06:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
the veterans exemption is a local
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
overlay which means your other local
 
06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
property tax payers are picking up the
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
slack on that right the low and moderate
 
06:16:02.030 --> 06:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
program is completely different from
 
06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
that correct it's a state it's a it's a
 
06:16:08.750 --> 06:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
state exemption of a state
 
06:16:12.910 --> 06:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
tax in in theory it shifts a tiny bit of
 
06:16:16.430 --> 06:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
the state burden away from the lowest
 
06:16:19.788 --> 06:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
earning people to everyone else so in
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
that way it works just like an exemption
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
but it's a very appropriate policy
 
06:16:25.080 --> 06:16:27.708 align:start position:0%
but it's a very appropriate policy
decision

06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:16:31.750 --> 06:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh to make to be clear it's a very
 
06:16:33.548 --> 06:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate policy decision it's not a
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue but it's a very
 
06:16:38.350 --> 06:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate con uh policy decision that
 
06:16:41.230 --> 06:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly uh would support okay great
 
06:16:42.830 --> 06:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay okay are there any
 
06:16:42.840 --> 06:16:43.788 align:start position:0%
thank you okay okay are there any
further

06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh we have
 
06:16:51.510 --> 06:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:55.000 --> 06:16:56.788 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Zach Shen New
 
06:16:59.788 --> 06:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
06:17:02.468 --> 06:17:02.478 align:start position:0%
project um as I've tried to do I will um
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
just pull out the pieces that I think
 
06:17:04.830 --> 06:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
have not been address or answer
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
questions to not uh reiterate a lot of
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
the testimony in the past um we are in
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
1686 of all the bills we've heard today
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
um this is uh I think as represent Smith
 
06:17:18.350 --> 06:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out this morning the most
 
06:17:21.510 --> 06:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
clearcut and straightforward um if it
 
06:17:23.070 --> 06:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
completely complies with the recent
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
rulings in the Rand lawsuit um it's a
 
06:17:28.628 --> 06:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
very specific targeted fix to what has
 
06:17:30.030 --> 06:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
been shown to be an
 
06:17:32.150 --> 06:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um deployment of the
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
swept um tax scheme um I think that
 
06:17:39.070 --> 06:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
something that is important to focus on
 
06:17:42.190 --> 06:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
is that in the Rand lawsuit also the
 
06:17:45.390 --> 06:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
arguments put forward um by the state in
 
06:17:49.070 --> 06:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
saying why this swept tax should not be
 
06:17:52.750 --> 06:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
adjusted did not focus on the content of
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the tax so much as the logistics around
 
06:17:57.788 --> 06:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
changing the tax tax code arguing that
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
it would be hard for municipalities to
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
for example remit excess swept in two
 
06:18:05.190 --> 06:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
months because they're already starting
 
06:18:06.270 --> 06:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
to set tax rates they're already
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
starting to collect the tax bill to the
 
06:18:10.590 --> 06:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
state focusing on the logistics of that
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill has a start date of
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
um 2025 that gives at this point almost
 
06:18:18.430 --> 06:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
18 months for municipalities who need to
 
06:18:21.070 --> 06:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
remit that excess to prepare to do that
 
06:18:22.590 --> 06:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that would be a
 
06:18:26.190 --> 06:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
specific issue um one other piece to
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
point out is um the conversations
 
06:18:31.390 --> 06:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
relative to swept around the concerns
 
06:18:32.830 --> 06:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
about folks who happen to be lower
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
income who happen to live in communities
 
06:18:36.670 --> 06:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
that have higher property value that
 
06:18:38.750 --> 06:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
might have excess swept and the argument
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
is often made that folks who you know
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
not that everyone that lives in
 
06:18:45.750 --> 06:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmith is Rich that is true no one's
 
06:18:49.110 --> 06:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
arguing that currently the retention of
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
excess swept benefits to a degree
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
everyone in Portsmouth regardless of
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
your income and relative wealth meaning
 
06:18:58.990 --> 06:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
that folks who are lower income that
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
might have been there for 30 years are
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
living on a fixed income are not getting
 
06:19:04.590 --> 06:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
assistance proportionate to the amount
 
06:19:06.150 --> 06:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
of need they might have to their
 
06:19:07.788 --> 06:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors who are making 10 times as
 
06:19:10.030 --> 06:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
much as a discussion before was
 
06:19:12.350 --> 06:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
happening redirecting some of that XS
 
06:19:14.910 --> 06:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
swep two programs designed specifically
 
06:19:17.110 --> 06:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
to provide property tax Rel for people
 
06:19:20.910 --> 06:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
who need it could in fact benefit more
 
06:19:22.628 --> 06:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
people with lower incomes living in
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
communities that have excess swept right
 
06:19:24.840 --> 06:19:29.430 align:start position:0%
communities that have excess swept right
now

06:19:29.430 --> 06:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:31.510 --> 06:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
I think that I will uh leave it at that
 
06:19:33.310 --> 06:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
I'll pass around my written testimony
 
06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then one last thing is relative to
 
06:19:36.910 --> 06:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee considering these
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues I really think it's um helpful
 
06:19:42.670 --> 06:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill is also with the one that
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
representative Leno proposed that had
 
06:19:46.350 --> 06:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
those expansions to the low and moderate
 
06:19:48.110 --> 06:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program there could
 
06:19:50.510 --> 06:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
be some creative combining of those
 
06:19:53.468 --> 06:19:53.478 align:start position:0%
since this money again could be about
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
$25 million that could enhance that low
 
06:19:59.150 --> 06:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
moderate property tax relief program um
 
06:20:00.910 --> 06:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that and have happy to
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions are there any
 
06:20:03.120 --> 06:20:04.548 align:start position:0%
take any questions are there any
questions

06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
for none thank you very much we have one
 
06:20:10.948 --> 06:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:15.310 --> 06:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:15.320 --> 06:20:19.070 align:start position:0%
 
laflame

06:20:19.070 --> 06:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
lfam thank you again Mr chairman and
 
06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I'm Natalie
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
laflam I'm a resident of bosin and I'm
 
06:20:30.910 --> 06:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys on the Rand lawsuit
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
I promise I'm not just going to rehash
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
what attorney binsky said um I wanted to
 
06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about the order and how it
 
06:20:40.030 --> 06:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
fits into the ongoing litigation and
 
06:20:42.750 --> 06:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
where that goes from here so as you've
 
06:20:45.070 --> 06:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
heard on November 20th the court issued
 
06:20:47.150 --> 06:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
an an order granting us partial summary
 
06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
judgment on the swept issue so in our
 
06:20:51.628 --> 06:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
case you could we split out the swept
 
06:20:53.990 --> 06:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
issue from the questions about adequacy
 
06:20:55.390 --> 06:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
and whether that's being appropriately
 
06:20:55.400 --> 06:20:56.270 align:start position:0%
and whether that's being appropriately
funed

06:20:56.270 --> 06:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
funed
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
which was the issue in conval as well so
 
06:21:00.750 --> 06:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
we isolated swept and the judge ruled in
 
06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
our favor and specifically ruled that by
 
06:21:05.070 --> 06:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
administering the swept in a manner
 
06:21:06.788 --> 06:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
which allows communities to retain
 
06:21:08.830 --> 06:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
excess swept funds or offset the
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
equalized swept rate via negative local
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
tax rates the state has violated part
 
06:21:16.190 --> 06:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
two Article 5 of the State Constitution
 
06:21:18.590 --> 06:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
and it ordered both practices to stop
 
06:21:20.788 --> 06:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
with the budget cycle that commences in
 
06:21:24.030 --> 06:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
late 2023 and ends with budget votes in
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
March or April 2024
 
06:21:30.150 --> 06:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
so what HB 1686 does is basically just
 
06:21:31.830 --> 06:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what the court has ordered the
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
legislature to do order the state to
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
stop doing um and I just want to note
 
06:21:39.468 --> 06:21:39.478 align:start position:0%
that the courts ORD is on really solid
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
legal ground um all courts orders are
 
06:21:44.708 --> 06:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
obviously but particularly here the New
 
06:21:46.350 --> 06:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has decided
 
06:21:48.830 --> 06:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
these issues before nearly identical
 
06:21:52.350 --> 06:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
issues it's the the law is very clear
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
it's a very clear violation of the state
 
06:21:54.558 --> 06:21:56.788 align:start position:0%
it's a very clear violation of the state
constitution

06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
um so basically and this might kind of
 
06:22:01.868 --> 06:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
get hopefully clarify some of the
 
06:22:03.708 --> 06:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
conversations that happened before but
 
06:22:05.708 --> 06:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
the swept is a state tax that's meant to
 
06:22:08.310 --> 06:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
fund the state's responsibility to
 
06:22:10.468 --> 06:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education and so
 
06:22:13.230 --> 06:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
that part is key to understanding why
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
these questions are the argument of well
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
some towns are putting this money toward
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
their schools toward education so that's
 
06:22:22.110 --> 06:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay no it's not because the swept is
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for the state's
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide an adequate
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
education so the way the swept works is
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's set at a certain rate and in each
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
Community the swept raise there either
 
06:22:38.430 --> 06:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
covers the amount the cost of adequacy
 
06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't and when we say excess
 
06:22:43.750 --> 06:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
excess communities excess literally
 
06:22:46.590 --> 06:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
means it's in excess of covering
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
adequacy so by the state allowing those
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
towns to keep it even if it goes toward
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
their towards their schools it's going
 
06:22:56.750 --> 06:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
toward non-adequate
 
06:22:58.910 --> 06:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
expenses and other communities that
 
06:23:00.750 --> 06:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't raise as much don't have that
 
06:23:01.830 --> 06:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
ability and that's why it's
 
06:23:03.628 --> 06:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because effectively
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're not paying the same
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
rates so um since then the order came
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
out November 20th and the state and the
 
06:23:14.750 --> 06:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
intervenor the Coalition communities 2.0
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
have asked the court to stay the order
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and to reconsider the remedy and I just
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
really strongly urge you to still
 
06:23:24.030 --> 06:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill now and not think that
 
06:23:26.948 --> 06:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
you have to wait until that all plays
 
06:23:30.350 --> 06:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
out um it's not actually a pending
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
appeal right now there's no requirement
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
that the decision be appealed and as of
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
now it has not been appealed appeals are
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
not automatic I think that's a common
 
06:23:41.868 --> 06:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
misconception people have the state has
 
06:23:44.910 --> 06:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
to affirmatively decide to appeal it
 
06:23:46.750 --> 06:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be reviewed by the next
 
06:23:49.628 --> 06:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
court um and we would suggest here the
 
06:23:51.868 --> 06:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
law is so clear the practice is no one's
 
06:23:53.990 --> 06:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
debating what's actually happening here
 
06:23:56.350 --> 06:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
that any decision on appeal is bound to
 
06:23:57.990 --> 06:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
be the exact same thing as what the
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
order is we have now it's really just
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
delaying the inevitable and the longer
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
this tax goes on while the case is
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
pending the more taxpayers are paying
 
06:24:10.310 --> 06:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
this unconstitutional tax um and it's
 
06:24:12.310 --> 06:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
just a big drain on state time and
 
06:24:13.868 --> 06:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
resources to keep litigating these
 
06:24:15.390 --> 06:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
matters that we all know are
 
06:24:16.868 --> 06:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and you have an easy
 
06:24:19.230 --> 06:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
fix in front of you right now um I think
 
06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting that when I say
 
06:24:23.350 --> 06:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
this unfair tax burden it's really
 
06:24:25.468 --> 06:24:25.478 align:start position:0%
shouldered by the majority of taxpayers
 
06:24:28.150 --> 06:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the state so there were approximately
 
06:24:31.230 --> 06:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
34 communities that have this excess
 
06:24:35.230 --> 06:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
swept in 2021 and the Coalition I had
 
06:24:36.990 --> 06:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
represented approximately 26 but I
 
06:24:39.468 --> 06:24:39.478 align:start position:0%
believe I heard earlier is 27 so
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
thereabouts um that's less than 15% of M
 
06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire so 85%
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
are paying this effectively higher rate
 
06:24:49.788 --> 06:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
because we allow this excess swept
 
06:24:51.990 --> 06:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
practice to happen same thing there are
 
06:24:54.190 --> 06:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
only about 22 locations with the
 
06:24:57.548 --> 06:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
negative local education tax rate set um
 
06:24:59.270 --> 06:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
and just a final note I just think it's
 
06:25:01.750 --> 06:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
really important that we break this
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
mindset that the swept is redistributing
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds from one town to another that's
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
not what happens we talked about is a
 
06:25:10.590 --> 06:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
state tax going to a state purpose the
 
06:25:12.830 --> 06:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
sweat sweat funds are not sent to a town
 
06:25:14.628 --> 06:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
if they're remitted to the state it goes
 
06:25:16.590 --> 06:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund which is
 
06:25:18.430 --> 06:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
used for the state's obligation say it
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
with me now to fund an adequate
 
06:25:24.788 --> 06:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
education um which is just benefits all
 
06:25:27.310 --> 06:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
citizens of of the state and the state
 
06:25:30.270 --> 06:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
itself that so that's it there's any
 
06:25:33.230 --> 06:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent
 
06:25:36.310 --> 06:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
mil thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:25:38.910 --> 06:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony I have a couple questions
 
06:25:42.230 --> 06:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
first of all as you have uh as you've
 
06:25:44.910 --> 06:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
monitored these kinds of cases across
 
06:25:44.920 --> 06:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
monitored these kinds of cases across
the

06:25:45.670 --> 06:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:48.270 --> 06:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
country has there been any state that
 
06:25:52.270 --> 06:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
has had a decision made in which the
 
06:25:54.030 --> 06:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
state basically the legislature
 
06:25:56.190 --> 06:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
basically said look
 
06:25:58.910 --> 06:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
this is a problem we understand it they
 
06:26:01.590 --> 06:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and try to solve it
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
without further litigation Etc are there
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
any states that have done that yes and
 
06:26:06.670 --> 06:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up I should
 
06:26:08.468 --> 06:26:08.478 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that recently this summer
 
06:26:10.628 --> 06:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
in July 2023 um the state of
 
06:26:12.590 --> 06:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania had a similar funding
 
06:26:15.310 --> 06:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh the trial court ruled in
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
favor of the plaintiffs so found that
 
06:26:18.590 --> 06:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state was not adequately funding
 
06:26:20.708 --> 06:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
education really long opinion like 300
 
06:26:22.910 --> 06:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
Pages um and the state to its credit
 
06:26:24.910 --> 06:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
just said okay we lost let's go fix it
 
06:26:26.310 --> 06:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're not not going to bother appealing
 
06:26:28.230 --> 06:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're just going to start fixing it so
 
06:26:29.628 --> 06:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
that could that could happen here in New
 
06:26:32.430 --> 06:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if there if the if the state
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
chose to they could just start fixing
 
06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
the problem and not drag out the
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
litigation and my second question is I'm
 
06:26:40.990 --> 06:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not a an attorney so could you
 
06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
define the term summary judgment what
 
06:26:46.670 --> 06:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
that actually means and and what the
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
impact of that is sure yes so summary
 
06:26:52.910 --> 06:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
judgment is when an issue a case is
 
06:26:54.628 --> 06:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
decided on the merits without needing to
 
06:26:58.030 --> 06:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
go to a full trial so the idea is the
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
parties all agree on the material the
 
06:27:03.230 --> 06:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
relevant important facts and it's just a
 
06:27:04.830 --> 06:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
matter of law so the judge can look at
 
06:27:08.310 --> 06:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
the record and apply the law and reach a
 
06:27:10.270 --> 06:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
final decision so that's what happened
 
06:27:12.910 --> 06:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
here with our case we like I said kind
 
06:27:15.070 --> 06:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
of carved out the swept issue and
 
06:27:16.788 --> 06:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's no debate on the tax rates the
 
06:27:18.670 --> 06:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
numbers are what they are um the state
 
06:27:21.788 --> 06:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
agreed so we just sent it to the court
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the looking at the law and the
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
facts and he granted us some re
 
06:27:26.868 --> 06:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
judgement meaning we did not need to do
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
a full evidentiary hearing evidentiary
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
trial that's in contrast to the rest of
 
06:27:33.788 --> 06:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
our case which we're still waiting for
 
06:27:35.948 --> 06:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
trial and for conal which had to go
 
06:27:37.628 --> 06:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
through you know you call witnesses and
 
06:27:39.750 --> 06:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
they testify a full trial it's just
 
06:27:41.788 --> 06:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
decided on the facts in the law before
 
06:27:44.510 --> 06:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you any other questions
 
06:27:47.948 --> 06:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
representa cordelli thank you um since
 
06:27:49.830 --> 06:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
you brought up the Pennsylania case and
 
06:27:52.830 --> 06:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
they resolved um the situ the funding
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
situation um based on the court decision
 
06:27:59.150 --> 06:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
um do you know how they resolved it um
 
06:28:01.390 --> 06:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe if there was additional
 
06:28:03.670 --> 06:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
funding involved where they found that
 
06:28:03.680 --> 06:28:05.070 align:start position:0%
funding involved where they found that
additional

06:28:05.070 --> 06:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:28:07.230 --> 06:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
funding off the top of my head I'm not
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure because it just happened this
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
summer so I don't know if if they've
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
fixed it yet I think it's just more the
 
06:28:16.230 --> 06:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
point I think representative Miler was
 
06:28:18.670 --> 06:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
getting at was they didn't appeal so
 
06:28:20.590 --> 06:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to start fixing it
 
06:28:22.868 --> 06:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
without waiting to see if another Court
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
does something
 
06:28:24.000 --> 06:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
does something
different

06:28:25.510 --> 06:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:28:27.468 --> 06:28:27.478 align:start position:0%

06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%

06:28:30.240 --> 06:28:31.190 align:start position:0%

regarding

06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
06:28:34.030 --> 06:28:34.040 align:start position:0%

Cordell Cordell cascaden it's time to
 
06:28:39.708 --> 06:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
here representative lad you need another
 
06:28:43.868 --> 06:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
cup of
 
06:28:47.910 --> 06:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
go yeah thank you uh for my question and
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that attorney Lam is the last
 
06:28:51.708 --> 06:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
speaker on this bill just want to put
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
something in perspective if she can
 
06:28:56.110 --> 06:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
answer this question question so for
 
06:28:58.390 --> 06:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
years we've attempted to resolve this
 
06:29:00.670 --> 06:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
school funding issue right and we
 
06:29:02.990 --> 06:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten there and I think we are
 
06:29:04.430 --> 06:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
all part of the
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislation because we want to protect
 
06:29:10.430 --> 06:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights am I right
 
06:29:12.708 --> 06:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's about protecting our rights to a
 
06:29:15.430 --> 06:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
fair and appropriate public
 
06:29:17.910 --> 06:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
education and if we don't keep that at
 
06:29:22.110 --> 06:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
the Forefront and making that happen it
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
could never get
 
06:29:26.590 --> 06:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
resolved but in in the meantime um in
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
this process the the state has had to
 
06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
incur uh many factors to a cost right
 
06:29:38.230 --> 06:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
they've had to spend many dollars to be
 
06:29:41.030 --> 06:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
able to defend themselves uh in all
 
06:29:42.430 --> 06:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
these years of
 
06:29:42.440 --> 06:29:44.350 align:start position:0%
these years of
lawsuits

06:29:44.350 --> 06:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
um and really what it's done is
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
prevented or blocked the protection of
 
06:29:52.030 --> 06:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights is there any
 
06:29:55.750 --> 06:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
data on how much of our money has been
 
06:29:59.548 --> 06:29:59.558 align:start position:0%
spent by the state to defend themselves
 
06:30:02.990 --> 06:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent this from being resolved yes
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and actually we recently did a right
 
06:30:08.110 --> 06:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
to know request to the state about this
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
very question of how much money is being
 
06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
spent on defending these lawsuits and
 
06:30:15.310 --> 06:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
the response was December 22nd 2023 so I
 
06:30:17.310 --> 06:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't have historical data of what they
 
06:30:20.270 --> 06:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
spent with the 15,000 Claremont or
 
06:30:23.070 --> 06:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
londondary but just conal and Rand so
 
06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
conal was filed in 2019
 
06:30:29.628 --> 06:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
um and the AG attorneys are handling it
 
06:30:31.830 --> 06:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
but they also hired outside Council from
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
out of state to help defend the lawsuit
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
so just payments to those out of state
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys and this is current through
 
06:30:42.750 --> 06:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
December 1st 2023 and I know they've
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
done things since then in the last month
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
but they have paid
 
06:30:51.388 --> 06:30:51.398 align:start position:0%
1,848 64 27 cents just to out of state
 
06:30:56.110 --> 06:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys to defend conval uh they spent
 
06:31:00.030 --> 06:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
10288 And1 on other expenses things like
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
expert fees depositions court fees
 
06:31:04.830 --> 06:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
transcripts that stuff um so that
 
06:31:07.628 --> 06:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any calculation of how
 
06:31:10.030 --> 06:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
much time from our own state attorneys
 
06:31:12.670 --> 06:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
or resources has gone into this uh Rand
 
06:31:15.708 --> 06:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
we filed in 2022 and again through
 
06:31:18.948 --> 06:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
December 1st they have spent
 
06:31:18.958 --> 06:31:20.670 align:start position:0%
December 1st they have spent
8394

06:31:20.670 --> 06:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
8394
 
06:31:26.190 --> 06:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
349 on outof state Council fees and 20
 
06:31:29.030 --> 06:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
$2,716 on other expenses so just
 
06:31:31.270 --> 06:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
defending this um and of course if they
 
06:31:33.990 --> 06:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
appeal that drags this out longer more
 
06:31:36.910 --> 06:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
and more fees uh more money wasted
 
06:31:39.750 --> 06:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
defending unconstitutional practices
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
from our tax revenues yes thank you so
 
06:31:46.110 --> 06:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
there is not an easy
 
06:31:49.230 --> 06:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
fix based upon all the money we spent in
 
06:31:51.190 --> 06:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
all the years we spent addressing this
 
06:31:53.270 --> 06:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
issue it's the general court doesn't
 
06:31:56.548 --> 06:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
seem to move that quickly
 
06:31:58.070 --> 06:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
just as a
 
06:32:00.510 --> 06:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
