00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
got nothing in common or these two towns
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a ton in common and they're not in
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
the district um i'm from sullivan county
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
you can't drive through my district on
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
pavement without leaving the county to
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
do it so it's
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
nuggets like that that are really useful
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
to us because beyond that it's just a
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
lot of math there are sign up sheets for
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
people who like to talk we have a
 
00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.549 align:start position:0%
people who like to talk we have a
microphone

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
up here you just speak engine
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
and since we're recording it's
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
particularly important for us all to be
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
able to hear
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i hope i'm doing it okay my wife
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
all right we have people signed up and
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%

this looks like a lot but it's really a
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
giant font
 
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.029 align:start position:0%
giant font
um

00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
dear members of the special committee on
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
redistricting and the senate and house
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
members i want to begin by thanking all
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
of you for the time and hard work you've
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
invested in this redistricting process
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
this is a huge responsibility and your
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
work will impact all of us in the years
 
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
work will impact all of us in the years
ahead

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
this past year people in 74 towns and
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the state voted to
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
support the new hampshire resolution for
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan fair redistricting
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
clearly the public desires a fair open
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
and impartial redistricting process
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
your special committee has taken a good
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
first step by scheduling listening
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
sessions like this one
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
in all around in all of the counties
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
however the committee must follow up
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
these listening steps
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
these listening sessions with four
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
additional steps or actions
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
first the special redistricting
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee should immediately disclose
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
the criteria that is using to create new
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
voting districts
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
second once the maps are drawn by the
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
special committee they need to be made
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
available to public
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
each citizen deserves an opportunity to
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
see the maps study the maps and then
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
comment on the maps
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
therefore a second hearing in each
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
further the second hearing needs to
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
provide an option for citizens to
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
participate remotely i have spoken with
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
many people who cannot attend in-person
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
meetings due to coded concerns or other
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
many of them care deeply about
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
redistricting they deserve a chance to
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
both hear information and give testimony
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
directly to this committee remote access
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
would provide them with this opportunity
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
finally i want to urge you to
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate the popular population data
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
with communities of interest data
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
this spring non-partisan groups such as
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
the league of women voters and open
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
democracy gathered people from around
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
the state to participate in the mapathon
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
citizen mapping project
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
i was one of the citizens who
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
participated in this project by filling
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
out information on the town i come from
 
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
out information on the town i come from
tamworth

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
the data was then meticulously compiled
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
and maps drawn using both population
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
numbers and community of interest data i
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
have looked at these maps and believe
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
they present fair non-partisan and
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
balanced solutions to redistricting
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
please consider these maps when you're
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
making their decisions and i want to
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you again for giving me this time
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
is representative hatch in the house
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
welcome to our beautiful county and
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
welcome to the north country just a few
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
things i'd like to
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
add and maybe these things are already
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
in consideration
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what any of you think of
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.550 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what any of you think of
co-ops

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
but from
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
for the years that i've been in the
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislature i've heard a variety of
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
statements from people that live in the
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state that really
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't depict what coz county
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
is that's not in themselves but i'm just
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
not sure everybody understands that
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
some of the things that i've heard that
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
everything in coast county is the same
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
all the communities are very similar um
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
nothing could be further from the truth
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
like many other places
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and there's many other things um
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
we now
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
have changed from an area that is very
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the forest industry paper
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
making industry
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
which has since left us um just to put
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
that in perspective
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
when i bought my business in berlin 45
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
doing my due diligence one of the things
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that i noted was the number of people
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
that work in the
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
paper making industry
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
whether it be aligned services or
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
support services like loggers and
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise or the paper makers and the
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
machinists that work in the middle
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
very good paying job
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
jobs et cetera and that was one of the
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
things that attracted me to the store to
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
buy out building reno building supplies
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
because the income base was stable and
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
it was good
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
there were 35 000 people working in the
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
paper industry in coast county
 
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
paper industry in coast county
today

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're lucky if we have 200.
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
that transformation took place in a very
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
short period of time so so we're now in
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
a dynamic stage in this county and um
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're adjusting right now uh prime
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
young industry is a tourism industry
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we're very
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
thankful for it and we're very
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
protective of that and we're very
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
concerned that we
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
maintain things in place to attract and
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
be able to provide the services that
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
tourists come to and are attracted to
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and that goes to my point for an example
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
i live in borough
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
many of you have stated to me that i'm
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
from berlin
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with that but nothing to
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
beat further from the truth
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
gorham and shelburne the two communities
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
i represent are very similar in many
 
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
i represent are very similar in many
ways

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
we share a school district
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we share many other industries many
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
of us share churches and other social
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
functions so we're almost a community of
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
one though two separate individual
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
communities and there's a plethora of
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
other things that i can add to along
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
with that but my point is this
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
that though it's a numbers
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
focused item when you redistrict because
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
they have to work and you have to align
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
and many other things happen
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
i would just encourage you to please
 
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
i would just encourage you to please
consider

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
those aspects when you redistrict
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
currently my district has two
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
communities very closely aligned they
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
share services and they have many other
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
commonalities so in my mind it just
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
takes sense not just where i live but
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
many other places to consider those
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
factors because they should be
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
part of the makeup
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
next up i have
 
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:41.910 align:start position:0%

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
how about uh i hope i get this right
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
kathleen contra
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just an observer
 
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:56.950 align:start position:0%
i'm just an observer
okay

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to speak until i heard
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative hatch speak and i
 
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.470 align:start position:0%
representative hatch speak and i
realized

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
realized
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
my name is edith tucker i represent
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
class 5.
 
00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.589 align:start position:0%
class 5.
and

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
4s5 hangs together
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
because we are a long time
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
tourist area
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
in my district
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
our two
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh grand hotels
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
the omni mount washington
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
in broad woods which is part of carl
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is one of the four towns i
 
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.750 align:start position:0%
which is one of the four towns i
represent

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's made up also of twin mountains
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
so twin mountain and red woods go
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
together as carol
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
the army crown washington
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
is an enormous
 
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:05.190 align:start position:0%
is an enormous
enterprise

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
enterprise
and

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
the mountain view brand is also grand
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
hotel not as enormous
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
as the army about washington
 
00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.390 align:start position:0%
as the army about washington
but

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
they have the pluses of the tourist
 
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
they have the pluses of the tourist
industry

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they also have the costs
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
and worries about the tourist industry
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about multiple people
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
on weekends such as the one coming up
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
i also represent jefferson
 
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.190 align:start position:0%
i also represent jefferson
and

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
randall where i live
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
a town of 300. but randolph because of
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
its hiking past
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
has been a tourist area
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
on what we now call non-motorized
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
it used to be foregone's inclusion
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
that recreation wasn't motorized
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
particularly but now it divides itself
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
into motorized and non-motorized
 
00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.589 align:start position:0%
into motorized and non-motorized
so

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's true that my district
 
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.349 align:start position:0%
it's true that my district
has

00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
two school districts
 
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
two school districts
uh

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
not one
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
which would be probably nice
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
but the commonality of being long time
 
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
but the commonality of being long time
tourism

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
on having
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
built an economy on that
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
plus forestry
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the mills that were in
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
district five
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was the logging itself
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
the loggers the people who processed the
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
people who hauled
 
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.990 align:start position:0%
people who hauled
so

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's shifting too as
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
tourism is growing
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
and all of cos although we're by no
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
means the same
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
as has been said before
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
there is commonalities of dealing with
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the planning population
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
finding ways to keep our young people
 
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
finding ways to keep our young people
here

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for education
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
and that we are preparing our young
 
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:08.790 align:start position:0%
and that we are preparing our young
people

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.829 align:start position:0%
people
to

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
make their way in a world that's really
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
quite different
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
than 10 or
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
30 40 years ago
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
and we needed an equity here
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
in co-ops so that we're able to give our
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
young people
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
the same benefits of education as others
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
so that aspiration that parents
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
grandparents and your great-grandparents
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
have is a commonality that all of co-ops
 
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
have is a commonality that all of co-ops
have

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
and it's very apparent that that's the
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
case the aging population of which i'm
 
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.829 align:start position:0%
case the aging population of which i'm
apart

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
apart
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm quite familiar with it
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
and there is tremendous worry about the
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
future here
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that is a commonality
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
so as you redistrict
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
be thinking about
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
sort of
aspirational

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
collective

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the kind of problems that were

and the kind of problems that were
resting

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
resting
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
they're not that different
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
west stewart sound
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
from randolph
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
from berlin there is a commonality to be
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
in this county
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
and it's worrisome
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
to go from 10 representatives out of 400
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
down to nine
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
so your
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
work here
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
is tough in this county
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm aware of that
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
but think about
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
what it will be
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
to really represent
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
constituents if there are only nine
 
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.550 align:start position:0%
constituents if there are only nine
representatives

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
pretty tough
 
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.510 align:start position:0%
pretty tough
so

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
i also want to say
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
here in this courthouse
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
very often
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
we have meetings and co-ops and
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
buildings that really aren't ada
 
00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.109 align:start position:0%
buildings that really aren't ada
accessible

00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
this one is
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
it has all the improvements of
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
a modern building of sound and lights
 
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.990 align:start position:0%
a modern building of sound and lights
elevators

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
elevators
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
and things that make it so people can
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
come here and i believe it was
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
executive counselor kenny who had the
 
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
executive counselor kenny who had the
idea

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
of having at the courthouse i think is
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
an excellent one thank you
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm not gonna do is wrap this after
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
only 26 minutes in case somebody
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
traveled a great distance and is running
 
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
traveled a great distance and is running
late

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
late
so

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
want to just reiterate
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
um basically one comment about what my
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
um the reps in west county had mentioned
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
earlier and that is um coast county is
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
different from the rest of the state
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
because it's much more rural we're much
 
00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
because it's much more rural we're much
more

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.510 align:start position:0%
more
separated

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
separated
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
from the southern part of the state
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
which continues to grow when i first got
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
into the house
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
like seven years ago somebody tapped me
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
on the shoulder and said oh this bill
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about cobra that's in
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
your area no cowork is not next to
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
littleton so people don't understand the
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
differences in the communities they
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
don't understand the difference in the
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
geographic area what the economic needs
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
are what the school needs are and we
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
much better if coast county continued to
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
have the representation of
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
representation that it currently has in
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
i realized that probably the senate
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
district is not going to change much it
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
will still have
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
one senator so if you want to add two
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for taking the time this
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
evening i appreciate all of you coming
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
