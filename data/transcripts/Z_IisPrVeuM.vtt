name is John fermella attorney general
 
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire with me
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
is Kathy Carr our director of
 
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
administration as I said she will she
 
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 align:start position:0%

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
and make me look smarter than I am when
 
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
it comes to Dollars I'm just just for
 
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
the folks watching this the budget is on
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
264 for those looking for where it
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
starts in the budget book 264.
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for the interruption all yours
 
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.430 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for the interruption all yours
again

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you Mr chair so we have
 
00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.690 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you Mr chair so we have
prepared

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
um just a high level presentation just
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
to give you the highlights of our budget
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
and then we'll certainly be prepared to
 
00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
answer any uh more detailed questions
 
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
you have and provide any follow-up
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
information that might be helpful but I
 
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful to start
 
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
on page two of the PowerPoint I won't go
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
into too much detail on this because I
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
did appear before you about a month ago
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
and went through the entire org chart
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
but on page two we just lay out the
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
roles of the Attorney General I think it
 
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
helps to give context to what what we're
 
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
doing in this budget so the first rule
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General probably the
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
best known role is to serve as the chief
 
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer so at the end of
 
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
the day the attorney general and the
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
supervise all law enforcement activities
 
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
in the state where the chief law
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency there are many cases
 
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
we handle ourselves but any there could
 
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
be any number of cases that we might
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
assert jurisdiction over even if they're
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
not typically within our bailiwick and
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we we oversee the entire law
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
enforcement community in in the state
 
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 align:start position:0%
attorney general also serves as the
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
chief prosecutor
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
so under our law the attorney general
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
has the the duty to supervise all of the
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
County attorneys and County attorney
 
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
offices throughout the state County
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
attorneys are independently elected and
 
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
they generally operate independently but
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
under our statutes the Attorney General
 
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
is is sort of the the ultimate backstop
 
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
in the ultimate supervisor those
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
activities we meet with the County
 
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
attorneys regularly every two months
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
we're in constant communication with
 
00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 align:start position:0%
them and I think that is a a good
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
feature of our criminal justice system
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because we are all
 
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
working together we work very well with
 
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
County attorneys of both parties they're
 
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
really politics don't really come into
 
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
play for the chief prosecutors and chief
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
law enforcement offices and officers in
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the various counties so we work very
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
well together we have a very good
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
coordinated approach across the state
 
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
the AG also serves as the chief legal
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
officer so we provide advice to every
 
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
state agency or just about every state
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
agency we provide legal advice and
 
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
representation to the legislature we
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide legal advice and representation
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the judicial branch many people don't
 
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 align:start position:0%
realize that if the judicial branch gets
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
sued either for employment issues or
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
other issues we at the Department of
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
Justice represent the judicial branch
 
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 align:start position:0%
that does sometimes include representing
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
individual judges
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have very good procedures in place to
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
wall off those attorneys from appearing
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
in front of the same judges that they're
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
representing to to avoid conflicts of
 
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.629 align:start position:0%
representing to to avoid conflicts of
interest

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General also serves as as
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
what I like to say as really the
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
ultimate public protection official in
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
the state so in addition to to law
 
00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement prosecution
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
representing state government the
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
attorney general has the ability and the
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
obligation to take certain actions that
 
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 align:start position:0%
are in the public interest one
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
a good recent example of that are the
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that the office has brought
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
against opioid opioid companies
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Distributors for
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
contributing to the opioid crisis in the
 
00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:58.430 align:start position:0%
contributing to the opioid crisis in the
state

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
and then of course the attorney general
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
has to be a commissioner and run the
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice so that is another
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
role role of the Attorney General and we
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
also have a drug task force that that we
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
head up
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's helpful to go
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
through that from my perspective just to
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
sort of set the context for for what the
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
budget that you see in front of you is
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
the next page on the presentation is
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is a high level org chart we can
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
provide we have booklets that that break
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
this down even further in the various
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
bureaus and units but this is how the
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
budget looks at a high level for the
 
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
division of public protection the
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
division of legal counsel the medical
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
examiner's office and our division of
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
Grants management this is um
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
this gives you a breakdown of how many
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
positions are are in these various
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
high-level functions
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
one thing that is a bit confusing when
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
it comes to the Department of Justice is
 
00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
that our org chart for Budget purposes
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
looks a little different than our than
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
our operational org chart and that is
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
we break the office down sometimes into
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
units that are very small say one
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
attorney and one staff person sometimes
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
only one attorney and so for budgeting
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
purposes to have different I think uh
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
budget line items and different uh
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
budget breakdowns for units that are
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
that small would would be cumbersome so
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
I think for your purposes and looking at
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
the budget the budget org chart is is
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
most helpful and this is the high level
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
org chart we can certainly provide
 
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
further breakdowns if you want to see
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
say how many positions are in the
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau or how
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
many positions are in the transportation
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
and construction Bureau we can provide
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
that to you but for purposes of this
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
high level presentation
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
this we provided this org chart as
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
you'll see and as we discussed when I
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
was before you about a month ago the
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
division of public protection is is
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
the bigger component of the office this
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
is for the most part the the part of the
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
office that does Criminal prosecutions
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
and brings enforcement actions in the
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
public interest
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the division of legal counsel
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
is the next biggest part of the office
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:21.170 align:start position:0%
and that is
um

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
probably most easily conceived of as the
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
Civil part of the office so while the
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
division of public protection is the
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
criminal component of the office the
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
division of legal counsel is the Civil
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
part of the office the division of legal
 
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
counsel is is quite a bit smaller than
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
the division of public protection there
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
are 49 49 positions there
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
all total we have 166 permanent
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
positions we also have some temporary
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
positions but of 166 permanent positions
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
I think when you add in our temporary
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
positions we have Kathy can correct me
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but somewhere close to 190
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
total positions when you're talking
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
188 when you're talking permanent and
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
so skipping ahead to page five because
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
page four is just a nice picture of our
 
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.410 align:start position:0%
page four is just a nice picture of our
logo

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
page five is is a high level snapshot of
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
or I should say our
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh proposed budget in the in the
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
so as you will see
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
the budget as it's presented to you in
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget for the Department
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
of Justice would result in a rough an
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
increase from fiscal year 2023 of a
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
total of 40 million three hundred ninety
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
thousand sixty four dollars
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
to 43 million 598 407 and fiscal year
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
2024 and then an additional increase to
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
44 million eight twenty six Five Sixty
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
one and fiscal year 2025.
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
in percentage terms that's about a 7.9
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
percent increase from FY 23 to FY 24 and
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
then an additional roughly 2.8 percent
 
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
then an additional roughly 2.8 percent
increase

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:15.500 align:start position:0%
from FY 24 to fy25
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
one thing I would point out which I
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
think is important when when sort of
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
thinking about the department and
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about its growth and this
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
budget increase is that and Kathy can
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars of this increase
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
in each year so pretty big chunk is
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
related to our new building over at
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
Granite place so it's not really a
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
that million dollars of course is it's
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's money it's taxpayer money but it
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect what I would think of as
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
a growth in the department staff or
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
operations and I would be remiss if I
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
didn't say at the end of the day that
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars is a result of what the
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked us to do which is
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
which is move space so we are we're good
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
team players we're going to do our job
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and comply with what the legislature has
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
asked for but I would um put in a plug
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
for the notion that that million dollars
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
is not not necessarily something we've
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
asked for to add on to the Department's
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
functions so I think that's that's
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
important to know when you're looking at
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
how much we're increasing in our budget
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you thank you um Mr
 
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.069 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you thank you um Mr
farmallo

00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
farmallo
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
um where do where do other funds come in
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
because I noticed the actual for 2022
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
um the other funds were more like what
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're expecting for 24 and 25 so I'm
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
guessing the 23 number is like 2 million
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
too high for what you're actually gonna
 
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
too high for what you're actually gonna
get

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.210 align:start position:0%
get
okay

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so the other funds
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
the one component of the Department of
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
Justice's budget is our litigation funds
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
which typically every year we only
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
budget that's been the sort of the
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
approach of the legislature we budget
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
350 000 or so for litigation funds
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
we then come to the fiscal committee
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
throughout the year to to get money into
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
that fund so I think what you're seeing
 
00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:24.019 align:start position:0%
there is we don't have a final
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
under the revenue line there's other
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
funds there's Federal General and other
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah so okay so your your other
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
was two million short of expectations I
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
think in 2022 I don't see it but that's
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
what I think
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
and so therefore I'm wondering is 2023
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
gonna come in 2 million shorts so my
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
I we can dig into that a little bit but
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
I think what that is is our consumer
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau brings
 
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.610 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau brings
in

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
um funds every year from from
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
settlements from enforcement actions
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
were capped at five million dollars so
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
we can't have more than five million
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
dollars in that fund anything more than
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
five million flows into the general fund
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
and while we generally average
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
more than five million because we
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
typically send money back to the general
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
fund it's not the same every fiscal year
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
so some fiscal years were up some fiscal
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
years were down but we generally average
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
enough to send money back to the general
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
fund over and above five million dollars
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
I think that's what you're seeing it is
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to budget how much revenue is
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to come in because we we don't I
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
mean I I have a sense of what cases were
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
involved in that may result in
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
settlements or recoveries but it's
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
always difficult to estimate exactly
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
which recoveries are going to come in in
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
which fiscal year they come in three or
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
four months later so so was the 8.7 for
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
2023 unrealistic
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
I mean what's it going to be this year
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
because notice the next following years
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
you have 6.7 6.8 well I think I think
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
8.7 is what we're spending
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
out of the in other funds is that so
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
correct we hope to bring in 8.7 this
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
year that's how we budgeted based on
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
history based on history we budgeted to
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
that much because we have
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
70 percent of our budget is all
 
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:43.069 align:start position:0%
70 percent of our budget is all
self-funded

00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
we bring in
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
comparison very little we use very
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
little general funds so this
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry so this is the offset of
 
00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:58.610 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry so this is the offset of
the

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:01.329 --> 00:15:01.339 align:start position:0%
um what are
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
self-funded areas are spending and what
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
we expect to bring in to cover those
 
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.509 align:start position:0%
we expect to bring in to cover those
self-funded

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
funds and one of those is consumer
 
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.069 align:start position:0%
funds and one of those is consumer
protection

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
um in history
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
shows that we normally bring in a little
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
bit more but we did not in 2022.
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's also not just consumer
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
protection right so for for our
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
assistant Deputy medical examiners for
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
instance those are paid for out sub
 
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:35.420 align:start position:0%
what 1.1 1.2 million dollars in that
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
range so other funds I think the
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
consumer protection fund is the biggest
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
component of other funds but it's it's
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
not the only component but I think the
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
question you're getting to
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative is and we're actually
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
going to talk about this later because
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason we you'll see an
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
increase in general funds we have to be
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
careful when we budget with the consumer
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
protection fund because it again it we
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
can I think rely on an average but in
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
any given year it's difficult to
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
estimate exactly how much we're going to
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
bring in So when you say is it realistic
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
is 2023 realistic
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
I think the 8.7 million total probably
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
is realistic when you add up what we've
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
what we've either brought in above four
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection fund or what
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
we have left over but
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
um again that's 2023 even estimating out
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
to 2024 and 2025 is difficult it's part
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
of the reason we have
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
in this budget proposed shifting some of
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
the items that were on other funds like
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection funds back to
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
General funds so that we're not
 
00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.730 align:start position:0%
General funds so that we're not
um

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't end up with a
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
individual fiscal year where we don't
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
have enough to cover what's budgeted as
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
far as far as operations so
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
it just seems weird to me because
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
the actual of 2022 was 6.7 you expect
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
this year 8.7 and then you expect the
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
next two years 6.7 6.7 see what I mean
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
why should this year be somehow
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
different than so four years of the
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
three years yeah I'm gonna yeah I'll
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
skip to what so what happened in the
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
last budget and
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I thought I did not think this was a
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
good idea which is why we're trying to
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
switch it back what happened to the in
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
the last budget is that
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
in the early part of the formation of
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
the budget when there was a thought that
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
we may we may have less General funds
 
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.390 align:start position:0%
we may we may have less General funds
available

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
a number of positions that are in our
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau that aren't related to
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection were shifted on to
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection fund to save
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
General funds and so we budgeted
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
for Consumer it was put in the budget to
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
say okay we're expecting this much in
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
other funds consumer protection funds to
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
cover those positions
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
we did cover those positions I think
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
that is not sustainable so what we have
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
proposed in this budget is to shift
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
those positions that are not related to
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection back to the general
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
fund it's why you see that Spike and why
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
you see it going down so I think you've
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
you've caught on to the problem that we
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
identified and felt that we should
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
any further questions on on this high
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
level snapshot okay
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
you will notice that
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
and we've covered now a part of it you
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
will notice that while the overall
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
budget for the Department I
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
I guess it's sort of this isn't if I do
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
say so myself moment is is
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
um not the increase is not excessive
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
when you account for the million dollars
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
or so that's related to the new building
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is a significant increase in
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
general funds and so our next slide
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to just highlight for you
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
the reason for that increase in general
 
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
the reason for that increase in general
funds

00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
the biggest reason is what we talked
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
about with regard to the shift of
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
positions so that takes up a big chunk
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
but on the next slide
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
we have request we have requested some
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
additional resources which I'll which
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
I think when I appeared before you in
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
about a month ago we talked about
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
additional resources for our elder abuse
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
and financial exploitation unit
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
so those are those are additional
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
resources we've requested that would be
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
General funded it's three new positions
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
a new attorney a new investigator and a
 
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
new investigative paralegal right now
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
our Elder Fraud Unit actually only has
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
one full-time attorney dedicated to it
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
it shares paralegals and investigators
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
with other other parts of the Consumer
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau so we we really want
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
to dedicate more resources to elder
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation so that
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
is part of what accounts for our general
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
fund increase
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
the YDC criminal investigation
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
these are additional general fund
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
resources but they are temporary
 
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.390 align:start position:0%
resources but they are temporary
resources

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
one or more of you may recall that a
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we came to the fiscal
 
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
committee and got approval to accept and
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
expend arpa funds for six temporary YDC
 
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.450 align:start position:0%
expend arpa funds for six temporary YDC
positions

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
the funding for those six temporary
 
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
positions we think is going to run out
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
about by about the end of fiscal year
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
24. and in discussing this with the
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
governor and discussing how we kind of
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
project out our need for these positions
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
we did rather than come back for more
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
arpa funds in this budget we're asking
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
for General funds to cover those
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
positions for fiscal year 25.
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
we don't expect that these are going to
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
be permanent positions we don't think
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to need them for years and
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
years but they it does result in a
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
general fund increase in this budget
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've tried to do
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
internally is spread out some of the YDC
 
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.230 align:start position:0%
internally is spread out some of the YDC
work

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
not just within our contemporary YDC
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
unit but to other lawyers in the office
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to have these
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
additional temporary resources for for
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
many many years for now we're asking for
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
the general funds for fiscal year 25 but
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
it is my hope and it's our goal that
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
when we come back for the next budget we
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
can decrease at a minimum decrease any
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
ask for further temporary resources
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to build build our
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
efforts on YDC into the wider criminal
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
Bureau so that we're not necessarily
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
causing that to grow the office
 
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.810 align:start position:0%
causing that to grow the office
permanently

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
the next reason for the general fund
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
increase I've already covered that's
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
moving some of the criminal some of the
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
non-consumer protected criminal
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
positions off of the consumer protection
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
fund and back on to the general fund
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
I think that's the right way to go for a
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
couple reasons one in representative
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
McGuire kind of identified this you put
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
yourself in I think budget difficulties
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
when you when you start relying on
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
unreliable funds for what are really
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
pitch I would make on this front is that
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day when we bring in
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
money to the consumer protection fund
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
whatever money we bring in over and
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
above five million dollars
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
comes back to the general fund anyway so
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
if we have a a um a big year and we
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
bring in 10 to 15 million dollars into
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
that fund which does sometimes happen
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's Flo the extras flowing back to the
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
general fund anyway but there may be
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
years where we only bring in a couple
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars and so
 
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
we don't want to end up in a situation
 
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.770 align:start position:0%
we don't want to end up in a situation
where

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
if our typical needs are two and a half
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
three million dollars
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to we don't want to
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
increase those needs on the fund to say
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
5 million because we're gonna end up
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
with a shortage in a given given fiscal
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
year so I think this is a more
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
sustainable more sensible way to go of
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
course it's it's ultimately up to you
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
but this is our proposal to to to move
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
some of those positions back and that is
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
resulting in an increase in general
 
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.930 align:start position:0%
resulting in an increase in general
funds

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
the next increase in general funds again
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
is related to to the new doj space over
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
at Granite place
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now the building we're in is a
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
state-owned building so we don't we
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't pay an annual lease
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
well yeah we don't pay an annual lease
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
to a non-state landlord right we do pay
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
certain expenses to das
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
while the state may end up buying the
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
building we're moving into down the road
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
at the moment the state does not own
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
that building so we now have a pretty
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
major lease payment that we haven't had
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
before so that's contributing to our to
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
our general fund increase
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then we do have some new permanent
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
position requests which I'll I'll run
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
through on the next page and talk about
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
why we're requesting them so Mr attorney
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
general what's the lease payment the
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
but that's the total expenses it's been
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion around some of the
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
different proposals that we saw last
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
year and now the new lease payments
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
which appear to be a little higher than
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
we anticipated that's why we advance the
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Das to be here to maybe
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
answer some of those questions but yes I
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
I believe we can come back to it while
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
Kathy looks it up but that's one of our
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah it's
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
yeah I like I said I believe the total
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
expenses attributed to doj are about a
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars I I want to say our
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
lease payment
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
is something less than that but we'll
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
we'll get is seven to eight hundred
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
thousand but we'll get the exact numbers
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
I can also help speak to some of the
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
increased expenses so because Charlie
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I had a lot of discussions about
 
00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.390 align:start position:0%
and I had a lot of discussions about
that

00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
with legislative leadership before we
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
so with that I will move to the next
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
slide which highlights our new permanent
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
position requests
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
we've already covered Elder fraud so
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
Elder fraud is sprinkled throughout here
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
we have one request for a new general
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
criminal position
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
this request comes as a result I think I
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
talked about this when I was here about
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
a month ago but this request is
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
connected to our efforts to expand our
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
Cold Case unit
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
two budgets ago the legislature funded
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
two new Cold Case unit positions
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
with covid and everything that went on
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the other things that took
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
the Department's attention during covid
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't make a lot of progress in
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
standing up those two new positions in
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the expanded unit and so in the last
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
budget one of those positions was
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
unfunded it was unfunded early in the
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
budget process when we thought
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
all agencies were going to have to make
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
10 cuts amid the governor's original
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
guidance agencies was cut 10 percent
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
I think due to the transition and you
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
know the transition from former Attorney
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
General McDonald to me that happened in
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
the middle of the budget process
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
we never went back and refunded that
 
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.690 align:start position:0%
we never went back and refunded that
position

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
um before the end of the budget so what
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
I did during the last biennium is I
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
moved a different criminal position into
 
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
the Cold Case unit because I wanted to
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
keep us moving on actually standing up a
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
full-time Cold Case unit this General
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
criminal position would would basically
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
backfill that so that's really what this
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
request is related to I think we
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
probably never should have unfunded that
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
Cold Case unit position but it was just
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
a result of initially thinking we had to
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
make cuts and then having a leadership
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
transition in the middle of the budget
 
00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:07.490 align:start position:0%
transition in the middle of the budget
process

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
which resulted in us never going back
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
and asking to refund that position at
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
the end of the last budget process
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so on the Cold
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
Case unit
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
you have a sense when you assign people
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
to certain cases which ones are the most
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
promising right so the secondary person
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
in that unit presumably is working on
 
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
the colder of the cold cases right so
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
result in prosecution compared to the
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
first one yes
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't necessarily say that
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
because we are approach a doj as always
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
is to assign generally to lawyers to to
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
any case so I we do have a head of the
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
unit and someone who works for the head
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the unit but I wouldn't necessarily
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
say it always Stacks up like that that
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
the the unit Chief is working on the the
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
most promising cases and the the second
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
in command is working on the coldest of
 
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.529 align:start position:0%
in command is working on the coldest of
cases

00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the Cold Case unit I should also say
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of work that happens just
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
to continue to assess what cases
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
um have good prospects for getting less
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
cold and one of the things we're trying
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
to do right now is do a fresh assessment
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
of of every case or going through that
 
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
exercise be because
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
these are sort of a case is a living
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
these are sort of a case is a living
breathing

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
thing you know it's there's always
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
changing you can get new information at
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
any time that might change your outlook
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
on a case and so constant reassessment
 
00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:50.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay but is that okay is that the least
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
payment or is that just everything
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's what we're paying
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
we used to pay 45. once again
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
like 71 in the 90s we had budgeted 97. I
 
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:09.860 align:start position:0%
see but we're going to be paying uh okay
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
yes okay so our not to interrupt you sir
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question oh
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely sorry about that
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
sure thank you attorney for taking it
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I just want to understand this isn't
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
open above the budget you've already put
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
these in the budget
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
these positions correct yeah these are
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
these are in the budget we're just
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
highlighting that these are new position
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
all right so just to quickly go back to
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
the the least question I think our our
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted lease payment is which would be
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
made to to das because Das makes the
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
payment then to the landlord is one
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
million two hundred thirty six thousand
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thirty eight dollars in
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 1 million two hundred
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
and twenty one thousand six hundred
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
sixty three dollars in fiscal year
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
twenty five
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm forgetting what the total payment
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
of the landlord is but I believe it's
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
but I think Charlie would be able to
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
answer that exactly representative evil
 
00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:23.990 align:start position:0%
answer that exactly representative evil
yeah

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
that was going to be my question because
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
I remember when you folks were going to
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
move over there you were thinking you
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
could put some other agency type folks
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
in is that happening or you're still in
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating that there are plans to do
 
00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
that and I know I know Das is working on
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're have we're in those conversations
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
too because we all want to try to make
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
sure that we um are able to do that with
 
00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
the money that was budgeted while not
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
cutting any uh what I'll call A A very
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
important need of of the doj so
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
now these are significant lease payments
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion at one point
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
that the state would have an option to
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
buy this property uh those lease
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
payments going towards that ultimate
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
possible purchase or
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
so the state's option to buy the
 
00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:20.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
around a year again I want to be careful
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm now I'm going to get into
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
details that I don't have exactly off
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
top of my head but around a year
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
the lease payments we make
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the first year's
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
lease payment is is a credit to the the
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
option but
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no but I think that's why the
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
option kicks in after only a year
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't necessarily want to
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
pay 10 years worth of lease payments and
 
00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:47.899 align:start position:0%
then buy the building
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mike could you get some more
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
information on that uh for the division
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would be great I representative
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question yes thank you you
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
pay an internal lease kind of payment on
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
this building here yes yes for this year
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
I mean yep so what is that
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
budget imprint
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
sorry we're budgeted for 97
 
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.049 align:start position:0%
sorry we're budgeted for 97
000

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
um yeah 97 134. all right so next to
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
nothing by comparison yes I think it's
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
so you were on the wrong line or
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
right 330. but still it's a quadrupling
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's it's a big increase I I
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
mean we can
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
so the next position Enviro
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection attorney so
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
this is
um

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
I would say this is our request but it
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
is also a request of the Department of
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services there's a few
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
things going on here that have led to to
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
this request
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
the first is that
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
represents the Department of
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so they provide
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
client counseling to the Department of
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services they defend the
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services if
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're sued but they also are the ones
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
who bring enforcement actions in court
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
that arise out of of Des investigations
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
that Bureau now also represents the
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy so while it's
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
called the Environmental Protection
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau the new Department of energy is
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
is a new client for that Bureau so that
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
that is added to the workload of that
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
Bureau there is also additional work
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
projects that are being funded through
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
through arpa funds there's a whole
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
category of arpa funds that are all for
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
environmental projects and so
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
um DES in conversation with our
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau asked
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
for a new attorney position and that's
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's what's that's where this request
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
comes from that's the reasoning for the
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.970 align:start position:0%
comes from that's the reasoning for the
request

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
and then there's also sorry do you have
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
a question representative
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney thank you
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you general for
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
being here so you mentioned energy and
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
Des share that attorney
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
I would imagine there'd be a number of
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
issues with energy being on one side and
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
Des being on the other
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
with that attorney for so there's is
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
there a team of attorneys that are
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
shared or is it just the one yeah
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's I would say they share the
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
entire team okay this new attorney is is
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
it really just as a result of the
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
increased overall workload from a new
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
Department a new client that the bureau
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
has but yeah if there were ever if there
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
ever were an issue that Des needed
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
representation on and they were on the
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
opposite side of the Department of
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
energy say in a proceeding before the
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
puc we would we would either wall off
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys within the bureau we might
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
also bring in a civil litigation like an
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
attorney from a different Bureau to
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
represent one or the other to make sure
 
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
that there is there are good walls in
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
place thank you yep that's
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative evil what are the
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
arpa-funded environmental projects
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
so I I don't off the top of my head I
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what those projects
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
are but I do know that there were there
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
was a significant component of arpa
 
00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:44.660 align:start position:0%
funds that were
 
00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
funds that were
were

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
designated for
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
environmental type projects so when when
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
the state got its whole pot of arpa
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
funds there were some funds that could
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
be used for basically anything because
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
they were Revenue replacement funds
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
there were some funds that could only be
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
used for specific purposes and there
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
were a couple of different categories
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
that were environmental related so the
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
state got
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm forgetting the amount of money I
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
think it was at least 100 million
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollars for for those those types of
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
projects and Des you know got permission
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
to accept and expend those those funds
 
00:36:22.859 --> 00:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
to accept and expend those those funds
but

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
the next uh attorney position is that we
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
requested as a new civil litigation
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
attorney so we
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have seen a big increase in in the
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
load on our civil litigation unit that
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
has been reflected in our requests that
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
we've brought to the fiscal committee
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
for for litigation funds
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh up until a couple years ago the
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
typical amount that we would request
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
from fiscal was was two to three million
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
dollars each fiscal year
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
in this particular fiscal year we we
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
requested over seven million dollars now
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're hoping not to spend all of that
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
but that was our estimated request so we
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
have seen just a big increase in the
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
workload on our civil litigation unit
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have part of the reason for the
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
request of litigation funds increasing
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
is because we also have vacancies in
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
that unit right now we have nine total
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
lawyers in that unit two of the
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
positions are vacant
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
we're about to fill one of them so we're
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
about to be down to one vacancy and then
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
we've asked for one additional lawyer
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
because I think if we could get up to 10
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
full-time lawyers in that unit that
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
would really help part of the increase
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
in the litigation fund I do think is
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
temporary because it's related to a
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
couple of really big cases we're working
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
on right now for HHS but overall based
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
on my general assessment of the of the
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
litigation landscape I think I think it
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
makes sense to add an attorney to that
 
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.950 align:start position:0%
makes sense to add an attorney to that
unit

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
so are these labor related mostly or
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
what civil
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I mean fraud would be criminal right
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so civil litigation is when
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
the state gets sued so when we're
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
defending that's what that unit does
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
every now and then they'll assist other
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
bureaus with uh say enforcement actions
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
more proactive enforcement actions but
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
the civil litigation unit is the unit
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that defends the state
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
right why don't we skip ahead to the
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
medical examiners yes okay
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
so the the new assistant Deputy medical
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
examiner positions
 
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.550 align:start position:0%
examiner positions
are

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is taking
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
positions or not positions but taking
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
individuals so right now we have 10
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
assistant Deputy medical examiners
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
but they are or is it 12. yeah right now
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
we have 12 assistant Deputy medical
 
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:47.900 align:start position:0%
examiners but they are contractors so
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
I've had a lot of discussion about this
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
with our chief medical examiner we
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
thought about doing it in the last
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
biennium we decided not to but after
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
more discussion what we're proposing in
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
this budget is to create
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
10 full-time positions so to make these
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
Deputy medical examiners full-time
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
employees as opposed to contractors we
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
expect this is going to be cost neutral
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
or if anything actually save a little
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
bit of money but they're
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
I have a on the next slide if you'd like
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
me to skip to it there are a few reasons
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
the first is that the IRS over the years
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
has at various times raised concerns
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
with with the structure
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we use for our assistant Deputy
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
medical examiners they have raised
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
questions as to whether they're really
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
independent contractors because in many
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
ways they do function like employees
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
and while they've never
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
formally made a finding against us
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
that could change at some point and so
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
that that's one reason we think it makes
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
sense to just make the change
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's so it also can be more difficult to
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
manage individuals who essentially are
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
working for the state but aren't
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
employers they're all individual
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
contractors they're not you know we
 
00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:08.450 align:start position:0%
contractors they're not you know we
can't

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
we can't Implement employment policies
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
that they're really bound to we can
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
negotiate what's in their contracts but
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
you have to do that over and over again
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so that that's an administrative
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
burden and can get kind of cumbersome
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
we also sometimes struggle with coverage
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the state and if
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
10 assistant Deputy medical examiners
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
who were state employees it would be
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
easier for us to say look you're going
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
to cover Cheshire for the next couple
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
months because we're short there or we
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a vacancy up in the North Country
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
you're just you're going to cover the
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
North Country it's harder to do that
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
when you have contractors who really try
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
to negotiate in their contracts that
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
they're only going to cover cover
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
certain areas so that that would be
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
helpful to us and then
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
when there are 10 independent or when
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're multiple independent contractors
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
they compete with each other right
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily bound to each other they're
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
they're independent entities and so
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
unifying this function
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
under the office of the chief medical
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
examiner we think would be would be a
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
good move it would just create for more
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
coordination and cohesion
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel has a question for
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
you could could you tell me what the
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications are to be a
 
00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099 align:start position:0%
medical exam a deputy medical examiner
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
do you have to be a doctor or no no so
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
Deputy medical I mean I suppose you
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
could be a doctor if say you didn't want
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
to practice medicine anymore and you
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this but the deputy medical
 
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.940 align:start position:0%
examiners and
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
are another way to think of them is is
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
sort of the investigators for the chief
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
medical examiner so it's the chief
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
medical examiner and the deputy chief
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
medical examiner who ultimately do
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
autopsies and make determinations on
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
cause of death the assistant Deputy
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
medical examiners will go out to a scene
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
so if you have if you have a car car
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
crash a tragic fatal car crash where
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's a death don't go out to the
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
scene they'll look at the information
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll look at the body they'll
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
they'll collect what's there they will
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
report that back to the chief Deputy
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
medical examiner and then if if there is
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
an autopsy when that happens the medical
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
examiner will use that information
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's been collected to make their
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
determination so you don't have to be a
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
doctor I don't I apologize I don't know
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
off the top I had exactly what the
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
qualifications are but also they've
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
never been employees so we haven't had
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know a posting with qualifications
 
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
chairman so we only have I think is it
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
100 homicides or something like that so
 
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
is there enough work for 10 people so
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
the the medical the assistant Deputy
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
medical examiners don't just work on
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
homicides they they work on on any death
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily if we don't if there is
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
not every death but there's a much
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
broader category of deaths that they
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
work on than homicides if a death is
 
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.630 align:start position:0%
work on than homicides if a death is
unexpected

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
unexpected
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
um or there's uh something about it that
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
makes us think we need to at least check
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
it out and gather information those are
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
the deaths the deaths they work on so
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's a much broader category than just
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
the homicides is it is it um 10 because
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's one per County
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we picked 10 we
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
witness it's not necessarily one in each
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
County because the bigger counties need
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
more right but that's that's why we took
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
it down from 12 to 10 just we thought we
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
we thought we could make it work based
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
on conversation with with 10 especially
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
if they're full-time employees
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz has a question
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
um I've heard that there is a backlog in
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
rape kit processing I'd imagine
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
this office would have some role in that
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if there still is a
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
backlog or if that is a myth and same on
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
I know during the um
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
Crux of the opioid crisis we had a
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
backlog and autopsies too and
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
determinations of death
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um how are those two situations
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so on the
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
rape kits the the office of the chief
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
medical examiner actually does not have
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
a role in in those
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um that's the state lab
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
I we have been involved in conversations
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
regarding that though and and and I've
 
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
talked to the commissioner's safety
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
about this we're taking steps to address
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
that backlog I don't know if I can tell
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
you today that there is no backlog but I
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
can tell significant progress has been
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
made and we are very aware of that issue
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
and we're we're taking steps to ensure
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
that we eliminate the backlog and that
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't recur we've had a lot of
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Coalition against
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence about the
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
issue too and
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
they are aware of the steps we're taking
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's working on working on that
 
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.150 align:start position:0%
everybody's working on working on that
um

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
as to autopsies I think during
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say there's necessarily a um
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
a backlog on on autopsies because those
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
have to get done you know within a
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
certain period of time but cause of
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
death determinations do take some time I
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
during covid those did get somewhat
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
backed up we've made a lot of progress
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
on that one of the issues we're dealing
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
with right now is we we came to the
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
legislature probably a couple of
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
bienniums ago to get a third medical
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
examiner position so we're budgeted for
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
a chief medical examiner a deputy chief
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
medical examiner and then an associate
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
medical examiner that associate medical
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
examiner position has been vacant for a
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years so we that is added to
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
our struggle but we we are certainly
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
taking every step we can to at least
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
reduce any backlog and cause of death
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
and final cause of death determinations
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
often there's an initial determination
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's made in an initial death
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
certificate that is issued so that next
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
of kin can take the steps necessary but
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
the medical examiner can't make a final
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
cause of death determination until they
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
have all all the information in and
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
until they have the ability to look at
 
00:46:19.569 --> 00:46:19.579 align:start position:0%
all that information make a formal final
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
finding so we're we're working on that
 
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.230 align:start position:0%
finding so we're we're working on that
yep

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
would you like me to go through the
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
positions we skipped or just move move
 
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
positions we skipped or just move move
forward

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
the new support staff I can just run
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
through those real quick
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah very quickly we're getting a little
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
short on time but I think you're an
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
important department so if we go over
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay too okay so I'll be really
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
quick so the First new support staff
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
position which is by far the most
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
important I would say is a human
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
resources coordinator we don't have a
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
lot of people assume we have this but in
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice we don't have
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
an HR officer our chief of staff who is
 
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:06.140 align:start position:0%
a lawyer has sort of functioned that way
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's not really best practice I it would
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
be good I think to have a non-lawyer HR
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
officer within the office so that that's
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
our first request as a new position
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're also requesting a new grants
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
manager position or I think this is this
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
is yeah converting this from part-time
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
to full-time so it's kind of half of a
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
new position uh
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the last slide I'll hit really
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
quickly I'll talk about all the grand
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
money we bring in but
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're doing more and more of that and so
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful to have have that
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
position be converted to full time
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
a victim Witness Program specialist
 
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
that that position Works in our office
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
of victim witness assistance works with
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
victims of crime
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
that office is doing a lot more work
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders around the state to do
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
educational programming to put on
 
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.530 align:start position:0%
educational programming to put on
seminars

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
seminars
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
to really help train
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
folks in the counties County victim
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
witness Advocates and others on best
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
practices for assisting victims of crime
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful to have an additional
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
program specialist to do that work
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
a new civil paralegal and civil Legal
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
Assistant in the civil litigation unit
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's really to support what I talked
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
about earlier the additional load on the
 
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
civil litigation unit there's a lot of
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
work that you don't have to have lawyers
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
do a Paralegal and a legal assistant can
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
can do a lot of great work to help the
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers and it's they're it's also
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
cheaper so we're proposing those two new
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
positions to help support the additional
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
civil litigation backlog and then we've
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
already talked about the Elder fraud
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
investigative paralegal so those are
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to skip ahead
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I'll run through this quickly
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
because I think I've talked about it but
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skip ahead to slide 10.
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
just to give you a couple of numbers on
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
the need for additional support for the
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and financial exploitation
 
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.690 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and financial exploitation
unit

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
one in ten older adults are victimized
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
of these incidents are reported that's
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly low it's among the
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
worst numbers we have for people who are
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
victims of some type of crime
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for that uh there are
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
various reasons why people don't report
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
one is that it's embarrassing right
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
whenever you're a victim but two when
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
you don't feel like there's a place to
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
report where something's going to happen
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the embarrassment of reporting is not
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the desire to see
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
accountability and see some see
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
consequences because there isn't a
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
enough of a function in the state to to
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
investigate and prosecute these crimes
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the reason we're we're
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
looking for more resources here
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
the next slide also kind of highlights
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing increased victimization
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
of older adults especially in the
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
financial Arena
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a financial reality that that
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
baby boomers so people in the age of say
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
58 to 75 right now have have more assets
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
than than the generation coming up
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
just to kind of put it bluntly in plain
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
speaking terms we're seeing kids
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
victimize their parents right or kids
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
victimize an older relative their Uncle
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
um their aunt uh because they have
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
assets and they're looking to to tap
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
into those assets so that's that's also
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
increasing that that's what's leading to
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
the increase in victimization and then
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
just some numbers here there are various
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
ways that we get reports and tips on
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
on instances of elder abuse the most
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
reliable source by far our law
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement referrals and as you'll see
 
00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:56.420 align:start position:0%
here between the 27
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
2017-2018 time frame and the 2021-2022
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
time frame those referrals increased
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
from 758
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
total in that time frame to 1032 in the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
most recent time frame so we're seeing
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
these numbers go up I still think that
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
that those numbers are low part of what
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
this unit does and will be able to do
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
better with expanded resources is
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
educate law enforcement agencies on when
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
they need to be reporting to our elder
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation unit
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
right recognizing that this crime was a
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
result of an attempt to victimize an
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
older person and warrants reporting to
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
to that unit so education I think will
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
also lead to reports going up I think
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot going on that we're
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
not seeing and that in many ways is half
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
the battle is at least knowing about
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
the last couple of
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
points I just want to hit
 
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:03.140 align:start position:0%
and these are two positions that we are
 
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.730 align:start position:0%
and these are two positions that we are
requesting

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
that would be over and above what's
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
already in our budget the first is a new
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
victim witness specialist
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
I talked about this position with the
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
governor's office and it was sort of a
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
last minute point that I raised which
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
was partly on me it didn't make it into
 
00:52:27.609 --> 00:52:27.619 align:start position:0%
the budget but what we did not
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I should have
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
appreciated is that expanding the
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
capacity within our elder abuse and
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation unit will also
 
00:52:36.059 --> 00:52:37.309 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation unit will also
expand

00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
expand
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
the workload on our victim witness
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
Specialists we right now in our office
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
of victim witness assistants only have I
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
think three victim witness Specialists
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
who are full-time dedicated to that work
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
the head of our office is also a victim
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
witness specialist so she does that work
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get by with that we
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
try to be very efficient but I think
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
expanding the capacity that we've talked
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
about in our elder abuse and financial
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
exploitation unit
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
would result in us really needing an
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
additional victim witness specialist to
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
help support that work right now that
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
unit only
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
has the only has access to
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of the capacity of one victim
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
witness specialist and increasing the
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
the need for a victim specialist in that
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
unit I think really
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
makes it so that we need we need that
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
new position so that's the reason for
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
that request
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh from the division about
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
adding this specialist witness
 
00:53:37.319 --> 00:53:40.790 align:start position:0%
adding this specialist witness
specialist

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
I am assuming that oh representative
 
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.450 align:start position:0%
I am assuming that oh representative
McGuire

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think it makes more sense than
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
the Cold Case person so I would switch
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
from one to the other
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
although if you've lost someone and like
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
to get closure a Cold Case specialist is
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
very important but
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
um yeah but I don't think the volume of
 
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.970 align:start position:0%
um yeah but I don't think the volume of
cases

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
is anywhere near the same right it's
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
I would say the volume is not the same
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
but the cases aren't created equally
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
right the cold cases are our most
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
difficult cases by Nature that they're
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
cold so they they take a lot of work
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
just to try to get them to to not be
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.579 --> 00:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
Representatives

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
I was under the assumption that HHS had
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
an investigations unit into Elder issues
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
is that just something completely off
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
the radar not
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about so that yeah
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
they have a bureau of elderly and Adult
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
Services we do get referrals from them
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
but they do not do criminal
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
investigations of so if if we're going
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
to try to bring criminal cases to really
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
impose consequences that I think get the
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
maximum deterrence that's not what HHS
 
00:54:51.359 --> 00:54:55.549 align:start position:0%
maximum deterrence that's not what HHS
does

00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again general for
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
being here take the questions for the
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and financial cases when the
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
when it's not a family member or if it's
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
out of state or out of country source
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
that is pulling the funds or scamming
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
the individuals
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
what's the success rate on being able to
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
prosecute those cases and retrieving
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
recovering the the funds that were
 
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.190 align:start position:0%
recovering the the funds that were
stolen

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
stolen
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so I don't have I
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
can see if I can get you an answer on
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
that like what the success rate is
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know if it's a if it's an out of
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
country Source I mean that that's
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
difficult right being able to identify
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator those aren't the cases
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
though that we're most concerned with to
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
be honest I would say I'm most concerned
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
with instances where the victim knows
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
the person that's that's exploiting them
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
right we also see things like a
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
grandparent scam where it is a total
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
stranger who will call up call up a
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
person and say your grandson's been
 
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.250 align:start position:0%
person and say your grandson's been
arrested

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
I need ten thousand dollars to bail him
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
out of jail I'll stop by your house in
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
two hours can you have the cash ready
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know they stop by
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
they take the cash never to be heard
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
from again those are the types of things
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that are that are really
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to address we of
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
course have instances where someone is
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
ex you know victimized by by an out of
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
country perpetrator and I would imagine
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
the success rate on that to be honest is
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
pretty low because those are difficult
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
but that's not the the bulk of of what
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address with these
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
additional resources
 
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
additional resources
yeah

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
so let's just see if we can get to a
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
conclusion on your additional request
 
00:56:47.089 --> 00:56:47.099 align:start position:0%
here yeah is that your only ask I know
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things in House Bill
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
too that we'd like to discuss if we have
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
the time but is this your only
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
additional ask from the governor's
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
budget the the only other additional ask
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
and I would say the victim witness
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
specialist is much more important but I
 
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out the the other piece
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that there was an additional attorney
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
request in the transportation
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
construction Bureau and the funding was
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the transport the department
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
of transportation's budget the position
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
was not put into the department of
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
Justice's budget so
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
um it was an ask that we made in the
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
governor's phase the governor did not
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
approve it the position but he did
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
approve the the funding and so
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
you know I we put that in our
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
presentation to to point that out I
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
think there was potentially a
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding as to whether maybe
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
there were two different attorneys
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
attorney positions being requested but
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
that was our one other additional ask
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
was to actually create that that
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
position because the funding is there
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
the position isn't there so my my advice
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
would be switching into my advice hat we
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
should probably either create the
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
position or cut the funding but having
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
the funding without the position is is
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
probably not where we want to be
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you how many of your 166
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
employees are vacant right now are
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
vacant yeah I I believe we have
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
13 vacancies in our 166 permanent
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
employees I believe it's eight attorneys
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
and five support staff
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
it may be an important time a question
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
for Kathy we see these updates
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
occasionally in fiscal but the amount of
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
money that the Department of Justice has
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
been successful in returning to the
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I wanted to leave you with this so
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's a perfect question
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
so the last slide we outline are
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
recoveries for 2021 and 2022
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
um the department has recovered and
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
deposited to the general fund
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 126.7 million dollars
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
Grant funds managed this isn't really a
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
recovery I would say but it it is we do
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
the work to go out and apply for and get
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
the grants that we manage so about 138
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Grant funds managed
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
the 52.7 million dollars in opioid
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
settlement funds that's another recovery
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go into the general fund it
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
goes into the opioid abatement trust
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
fund but so we've listed that separately
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau has
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
had 6.8 million dollars in in recoveries
 
00:59:44.579 --> 00:59:46.250 align:start position:0%
had 6.8 million dollars in in recoveries
into

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
um either into the bureau or fund funds
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
other than the general funder or the uh
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement trust fund
 
00:59:54.059 --> 00:59:55.010 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement trust fund
um

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
the the Consumer Protection Bureau has
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
recovered 2.7 million dollars on behalf
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
of consumers those don't that money
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to the state that they take
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
it in they give it directly back to the
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
consumers that were affected and then
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
this is an area which I think there's a
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
fair amount of room for growth but we've
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%
we've recovered in those two years about
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
444 000 in debt recoveries debt recovery
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
um so that that that is a snapshot I
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
think of what what the office brings in
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully submit that I think
 
01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.049 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully submit that I think
this

01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
given all of the work the office does
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that the office generally
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
brings in more than it spends I think
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
makes the Department of Justice
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
um a pretty good bargain for the State
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because we not only
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of service we also recover
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
a lot on behalf of the state
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
so with that with the division field
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
comfortable in supporting the victim
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
witness Specialist or
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
looks like there's a lot of flexibility
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
built into the position as you describe
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
it so you can use it in not I mean we
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about the elder abuse cases
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
but if the time wasn't needed for that
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like there are other ways in
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
which it would be really beneficial to
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
have that individual So speaking for
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
myself I would support that addition
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
further representative McGuire yeah okay
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
can we add somebody in this recovery
 
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.990 align:start position:0%
can we add somebody in this recovery
[Laughter]

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say I mean that that is a
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
result of work of a lot of different
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
lawyers within the office I I think
 
01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:43.630 align:start position:0%
lawyers within the office I I think
that

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
on that point representative I think it
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
is important to highlight that while we
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
have various bureaus and units within
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
the office the lawyers and the staff
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
usually end up working in various
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
different parts of the office at any
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
given time so we don't have very many
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
people who are just siled in one area
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
they may focus in one area that area
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
might be their specialty but they do
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
various things one example going back to
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
environmental our environmental Bureau
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
is the Bureau that also represents the
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
judicial branch most of the time so
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
people really
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
do work across disciplines and they all
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
they all pitch in so these recoveries
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the office brings in really are a
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
result of of work across the office
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
obviously there are some bureaus that
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
get more recoveries than others the
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
homicide unit is not typically
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
recovering money on behalf of the state
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
but anytime I think the office gets an
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
additional resource it enhances our
 
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
ability to get recoveries on behalf of
 
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
the state because we can be flexible we
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
can shift work around and we can focus
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
on places where we can get good results
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative evil are you involved in
 
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
representative evil are you involved in
some

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
at this point on behalf of the state
 
01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:00.020 align:start position:0%
environmentally or otherwise
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
we are we are involved in in some major
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
cases also some major investigations
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
often if we're
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
um if we are undertaking an
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
investigation we won't actually end up
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
suing we'll settle before we we Sue but
 
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
we we do have some big cases probably
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
the biggest is the pfas case against 3M
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other parties yep
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
that any recovery in that case is is
 
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
quite a ways off but we are pretty
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
confident that we will eventually get a
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
big recovery out of that case
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
and there are various others where we
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
expect to get recoveries in the millions
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
now there are some issues in House Bill
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
2 which affect you folks who really like
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
to quickly jump to those
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mike do you have the specific
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
ones I think we had start off maybe 19.
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's a Department of Justice
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
section 19 is the first one and that's
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:13.370 align:start position:0%
on page
each

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's good that way we're
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
what is this oh this is the market
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
factors well I guess we checked that one
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
off yesterday when we slid over it but I
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's also 268 through 279.
 
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.849 align:start position:0%
there's also 268 through 279.
foreign

01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we we don't really have any at
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
least that we're doj requests there's
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
really no money requests in hb2 the the
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
proposed raise that the governor
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
included in the budget does affect our
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
Market anchors
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
so you'll I forget what section that is
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
in hp2 but that will
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so on page 73
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
the market anchors so kind of the salary
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
ranges for our attorneys did go up but
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is just what we're legally allowed
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
to pay attorneys what the money that's
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
included in our budget for salaries is
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
really what matters so I I wouldn't
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
that affects us but it wasn't a request
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
we put into hb2 that's tied to I think
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed raises for state
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
employees which
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
will shift or not based on what you all
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
decide on that issue
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
so in hb2 the governor had an
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 21 million dollars for
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
the uh purchase or lease of granite
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
places that are reasonable number
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie or
 
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:10.940 align:start position:0%
are we going to need to
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
exceed that or you're welcome to take
 
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
you can sit Charlie says right now use
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
that mic right there if you'd like
 
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.329 align:start position:0%
that mic right there if you'd like
Charlie

01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
here I apologize for stealing your mic
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um yes it's a reasonable number that's
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
the number we uh we gave the the least
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
number has a purchase price in it which
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
is the which is uh roughly 15 million
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
dollars plus the
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
um unrepaid cost of the Fed Up So the
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
landlord is doing a significant fit up
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
on the space and so that would add
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
another 6 million
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
so that's item 75 on page 31.
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
and I know there are weird rumors
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
floating around the state house but we
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get addressed yeah we would be
 
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.450 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get addressed yeah we would be
buying

01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
buying
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
one Tower
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
that is the South Tower which is
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
um the unoccupied portion today that's
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
being fit up there are some people
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
who've said oh I heard we're buying both
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
Towers including the one that judicial
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
branch is in and that's not the case
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions or at least not
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
with that money we're not commissioner
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
Arling house on a matter representative
 
01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:30.470 align:start position:0%
Arling house on a matter representative
evil

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
evil
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
just a real uh basic question you've
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
analyzed the uh
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh background of this and you've
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
decided purchasing it is makes more
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
sense than Leasing
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's not a great lease
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean if we're gonna we're
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
gonna have people in this building for
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
for 20 years we should buy it not lease
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
it and the obstacle to that is always
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
the cost I mean we've not done an
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
inspection of any you know if you think
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
about like a like a home inspection and
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
and if you really want to get into
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
detail we can tell you what's entailed
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
and then that's why Karen's here but um
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
um we would do we would spend a
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money over the
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
next few months actually assuming this
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going forward and that
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
you guys don't just excise it from your
 
01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:20.090 align:start position:0%
you guys don't just excise it from your
bill

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know look in detail at all of
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
the systems and Etc of the building you
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
know the equivalent of a home inspection
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
but basically somebody knows what
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
they're doing gets in the HVAC system
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
and all of that kind of thing
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
we figured out
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um other agencies or state employees
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
you're thinking we'll move over there to
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
join in with doj we we've had a lot of
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
discussion internally about that and and
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
exactly what that looks like is is
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
uncertain from the standpoint what we're
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
busy cataloging everybody who wants to
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
move somewhere for some reason is you
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
know losing their lease space or or you
 
01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:07.259 align:start position:0%
know rearrange this office or there's
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
construction going on here or
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
construction going on there and the some
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the moving pieces of that are you
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
know where exactly are we
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
for example on the annex Renault
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and what what movement does that
 
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.990 align:start position:0%
um and what what movement does that
entail

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
entail
 
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.970 align:start position:0%
entail
um

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
is the state really going to buy the
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
building on Hall Street where Department
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
of Education would go or not
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
um if that happens what would be the the
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
timeline on the Lonergan renovation for
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
example and how all of those things work
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we actually I think
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
I think at two o'clock-ish I have a
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
space yeah I have a space planning
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
meeting they'll talk about some of those
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
things but I I think you know big
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
picture of the building is about 100 000
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
square feet so
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
um doj has about two and a half floors
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
so call it maybe 65 000 square feet
 
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
which leaves about 35 000. we ideally
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't like to move people in who
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't need renovation
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
because that's you know easier
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
and cheaper representative McGuire has a
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you so uh when would the
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
transfer the purchase take place and
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
would their lease payment decline back
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
to the 300 000 range afterwards well
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
they they probably wouldn't decline back
 
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
to the 300 000 range afterwards because
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of costs that would have
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
to be entailed and I don't know I'm
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to actually ask Karen to come up
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
and join me
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
um because I'm going to say something
 
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.950 align:start position:0%
um because I'm going to say something
stupid

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
stupid
 
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
stupid
um

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay we can oh look at that
 
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.990 align:start position:0%
okay we can oh look at that
um

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've actually figured
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
that out because the purchase would be
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
let's just say House Bill 2 let's say
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
the budget you know happens and there
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
are no unfortunate tragic accidents and
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have a budget on July 1st we would
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
then start the process of uh negotiating
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we can buy before
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
completed by it's like a 12-month window
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
I think or eight eight or ten month
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
window maybe so so doj would almost
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
certainly move in in the um in the late
 
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.490 align:start position:0%
certainly move in in the um in the late
summer

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
and then we think
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
um in the late summer you know how
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
construction is
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.830 align:start position:0%
um and then
um

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
you know then we would buy the building
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and let's say that all went well at
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
a minimum the first fiscal year is is
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know the new price and the second
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
um

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
you know we'd have to look at because
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
there's it's still a significantly more
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
expensive building than the building
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
they're in and the building they're in
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
by the way there's a the you know why
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
Kathy and I have different numbers is
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
what do J pays and what the building uh
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
so when we started assigning costs to
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
building somehow accidentally doj
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
escaped uh costs being assigned to them
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
and they're paid out of the general fund
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and um and that would not be the case
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
in the future and so the cost of the
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
building let's say for example we didn't
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
move them and we didn't build a parking
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
garage and they stayed in in the old
 
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:18.260 align:start position:0%
Bank building
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
the cost would go up to pretty close to
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars I think it
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
would have been foreign change in the
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
first year five and changed in the
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
second and
 
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.370 align:start position:0%
second and
um

01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of the costs are going up
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and and some of that is based on on how
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
we allocate centralized costs today and
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
the centralized costs allocated of that
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
building would be dramatically larger
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
so you don't think we can go below the
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
1.2 million in the second year
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
you know what give me a give me a few
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
weeks to get back to you on that and I I
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
want to say no our deadline is next
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
Friday not this Friday next Friday oh
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
like the the 17th
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
um Let Me Take A let me take a crack at
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
that about the 17th but I think probably
 
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.810 align:start position:0%
that about the 17th but I think probably
not

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up yeah I just wondered how
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
the fit up was going
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
well and I see a Karen here that can
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
answer it's progressing
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
um if you were to visit the site it
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
would look different than it did you
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
know a month or two ago for sure
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
um there are some as as we're seeing
 
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:33.980 align:start position:0%
everywhere some lead times on the more
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
expensive pieces of equipment and things
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
that we're getting but walls are going
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
up and electricals going in and things
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
like that so it's it's progressing and
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions on granite
 
01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions on granite
place

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
I guess you're off the hook at least for
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
thank you all right are there further
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
questions for the attorney general or
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
Kathy on budget I guess representative
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you very much thank you
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
again for indulging us I just have one
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
request for information for the 10
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
medical examiners yep can you put
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
together what you would project the
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
average caseload for each one and how
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
much time it takes per case for them
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
just I think that's a missing piece of
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
yep that that should be
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
doable given that they're already
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
working on yes right so yeah we can
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide that absolutely great thank you
 
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman any other issues that
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
have hit your radar
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
that while we have the Attorney General
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
here that we should discuss
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh not off the top of my head but when I
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
call Kathy she's very good at getting us
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
information so
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
another person that can't retire so nope
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
she just got reappointed for another
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
five-year term so we're expecting we're
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
expecting her to fulfill that I guess
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're safe for at least another five
 
01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:13.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the medical Deputy medical exam
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a Hot Topic I guess today so
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's so much uh trouble filling jobs
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're feeling like you'll be able to
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
fill them even though you're switching
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
from independent contractors to
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's a great question representative and
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
I have had that conversation with our
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner and deputy chief
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
medical examiner a lot they feel
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
confident and I think we feel confident
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
I mean we already have a pool of people
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
who are who are acting as independent
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
contractors they feel pretty confident
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
we can we can fill these positions
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
because they're again they're not
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
they're not medical doctors so they
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't come from that really exclusive
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
pool that the medical examiners come
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
from so we do feel confident can never
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
so I guess all we're really looking for
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
is uh the answers to representative
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
Sweeney's questions on the medical
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
examiners and who will make a decision
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
on your victim witness specialist that
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
will be on our list to either check off
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
or decline but okay I think other than
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we should be all set with the
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Hoffman there's also that
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation Bureau attorney that's
 
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.470 align:start position:0%
Transportation Bureau attorney that's
budget

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
so it needs to be authorized if you
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
you know so we'll we'll straighten that
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
language out as long as the dot doesn't
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
assign it back to you to pay for it
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly yeah the money will be in
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%

then they survey a five-year term
 
01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:35.540 align:start position:0%
um what is it that the commission does
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%

I'll refer to it here as the EEOC to

enforce federal laws
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination and
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
employment as well if you turn over to
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
the next page you'll see the current
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
commission organization
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
below me is one assistant director and
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's an administrative assistant
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
position which is currently unfunded we
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
have a part-time secretary who is
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
providing some of those Services
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
currently and for the enforcement staff
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
we have five full-time investigators and
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
we have one full-time intake person and
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
we have a part-time intake position that
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
is currently unfunded and there is a
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
part-time paralegal position which we
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
have just recently filled
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
on the next page our numbers so this
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
chart is really just an aggregate over
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years that will show
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
you and we go from federal fiscal year
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
so from October to September excuse me
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
um just an aggregate on the number of
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
charges filed per month the number of
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
charges closed full Federal Credit means
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
that we may have charges uh or a case
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's opened where
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
the individual will maybe they remove it
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's something that needs to be
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the EEOC for investigation
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
so we would get an intake credit for
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
that and it wouldn't be a full
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
um we we get paid in reimbursement from
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
the EEOC so it wouldn't be a full
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursement specifically just an
 
01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:51.649 align:start position:0%
reimbursement specifically just an
intake

01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
intake
 
01:24:54.649 --> 01:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
and then next to that category there's a
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
listing of the number of state only
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
charges so those would be because our
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
partnership or work sharing agreement
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
right now is with the EEOC they only
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
deal with employment so if it's in any
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the other areas like public
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
accommodation education or housing those
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
are not covered by the EEOC so those
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
cases would be considered state only or
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
if it is an employment case and the
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
number of employees is below the
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
threshold for the federal government
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is 14 then that would be
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
considered a state-only case as well and
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
then the last column are the unassigned
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
charges so those are charges that have
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
come in those are cases that have been
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
opened those are cases that are not
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
assigned to the five investigators that
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
we currently have to begin
 
01:25:43.679 --> 01:25:46.010 align:start position:0%
we currently have to begin
investigations

01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the next page what we need
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
so our prioritized needs for the
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget the state fiscal year 24
 
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
and 25. so the governor's budget has
 
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
included reinstatement of funds for the
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant for us which is
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
great he is also provided finances for
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
us to add three additional three of the
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
four additional investigators that we
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
are requesting and then funded costs for
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
a move to a new location which is to be
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
determined because we don't know where
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
we're going yet our lease ends at the
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
end of October of this year and there is
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
not an opportunity to extend currently
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
the building is up for sale but I'm not
 
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
aware that it is under a purchase sale
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
agreement at this moment but we've
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
already outgrown it with just the staff
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we have and so we would certainly
 
01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:44.060 align:start position:0%
need to find a new location
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
once these additional staff members the
 
01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:49.219 align:start position:0%
three additional
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
investigators is hopefully approved by
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
you wonderful people and uh and then of
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
course he included funding for our DOT
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
shared costs so I think I well there
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
were the remaining needs was one
 
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.910 align:start position:0%
were the remaining needs was one
additional

01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
um investigator which was requested the
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
initial request and the budget I put
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
forth was for four
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
um investigators and we got three so we
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
are very happy with that just stating
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
these are the remaining needs that are
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
on the table as it were and to convert
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
the part-time paralegal and part-time
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
secretary positions to full-time with
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
the increase or just the number of
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
charges that we have there's more than
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
enough work for the paralegal to be able
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
to do on a full-time basis and then
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
to have that additional secretary or not
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
additional but to have that secretary
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
there full-time instead of Simply
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
part-time there are great many other
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
items that that person can do to assist
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
in the office more so than just
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
answering the phones
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's it so that is
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything that I have for you right now
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to answer in uh
 
01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:05.300 align:start position:0%
any questions uh just be gentle
 
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
any questions uh just be gentle
[Laughter]

01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
the question could you go and do the
 
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
unassigned what what a little a little
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
more depth into what makes a case
 
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
more depth into what makes a case
unassigned

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
unassigned
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
and how that fits into the picture
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you representative
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
Griffin for the question
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so when a case uh when a person comes
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
to us and makes a charge of
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
discrimination they encounter our intake
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator and that person will
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
um we we do normally draft the charge
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
for the individual but we've also
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
created a toolkit to allow an individual
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
to draft their own charges
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um so the intake person would just look
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
over everything making sure all of the
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
elements are there and making sure
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
certainly in that intake process that
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
initially they're in the right place so
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
someone could have a wages and hours
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
issue that does not have an element of
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
discrimination so we would listen
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
carefully but then refer them to labor
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
because wages in hours is not what we do
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
however there could be a situation where
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
it's wages and hours based on
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination so we would take that
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
into consideration uh draft that charge
 
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
or help the complainant draft charge and
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
then move forward with that
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
once a charge is drafted and notarized
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
so there has to be notaries and we do
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
have those in our office so people can
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
come to us and there's no fee they don't
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
pay us for anything that we do for them
 
01:29:40.450 --> 01:29:40.460 align:start position:0%
so everything we do is a civil service
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
once that charge is notarized then a
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
copy of that information goes to the
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
responding party so whether it's a
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
business whether it's a store or a an
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
amusement park if it's a place of public
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
accommodation or a school or a housing
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
facility that information goes out and
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
then hopefully that respondent will
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
respond to us
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
customarily what happens is the large
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of individuals that file a
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
charge with us are what we call
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
unrepresented or Pro Se meaning they
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney which you do not
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
have to have to go through our process
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
however the large majority of
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
respondents that respond to the charges
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
are represented again you don't have to
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
have one either way
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have sometimes had we do have
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
complainants that are represented and
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
respondents that are unrepresented in
 
01:30:35.169 --> 01:30:35.179 align:start position:0%
the same case
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
once that information is sent to the
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
respondent and they will send their
 
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
answer in to the charge
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
then that information goes into a file
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
and it is there for unassigned because
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
it is waiting to be assigned to one of
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
those of you looking for this in the
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
budgets on 309.
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
like the follow along represent Maguire
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
coming so let's uh look at the chart on
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
page 21.
 
01:31:09.719 --> 01:31:10.610 align:start position:0%
page 21.
um

01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
so filed are people coming in the door
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
right with a brand new case
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing right and closed is the
 
01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:22.139 align:start position:0%
number who are all done correct right
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
um unassigned is is the number waiting
 
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
wouldn't because there were more let's
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
just look at October there were more
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
there were nine more closed than came in
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't the unassigned go down
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
rather than up
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
this is an aggregate so it's not the
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
exact number that came in in that month
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
as open in the exact number that was
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
closed that month so give me just one
 
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
so for example let's take October of
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
last year similar
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
situation so if you left that first
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
number is filed which is 16 and made
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
closed 14. the full credit was 14
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
because that was the number that we
 
01:32:22.729 --> 01:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
closed we didn't have any state only and
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
so that unassigned number is 254 from
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
October of last year the following month
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
it went down to 232 so to answer your
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
question yes it would this is not an
 
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.370 align:start position:0%
question yes it would this is not an
exact

01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:36.380 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
October information it's an aggregate
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
between 2021 fiscal year 21 and 22.
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay so this is two Octobers
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
yes okay you is averaged okay well why
 
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't we look at
 
01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.189 align:start position:0%
don't we look at
um

01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
but over time it seems like you're
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
closing more cases than are coming in if
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
you look at the very bottom there uh 193
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
came in
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
276 got closed right so you're getting
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
you're getting a head right in some
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
sense the the backlog is going down is
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
that correct yes and uh to add to that
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have had staff turnover so there are
 
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:22.340 align:start position:0%
times where I've had two investigators
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
only so we don't tell people not to call
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
so charges are still opened cases are
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
still coming in and those two
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
investigators are moving their case long
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
case load along as best they can and
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
I've had a situation with just those two
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
investigators where I didn't have an
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
intake coordinator
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
so all of the things have to continue
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
going it's just that it's taking longer
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
for some of those things which is why
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
I've requested more staff
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
can you provide the
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
rather than the average number the
 
01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:01.139 align:start position:0%
actual month by month for the two years
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I can I could it may be better to
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
email that I can email you a chart
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
similar to this yeah that'd be great
 
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.590 align:start position:0%
similar to this yeah that'd be great
okay

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
um because just in general it seems to
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
me that if you're closing 70 80 more
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
cases than your opening
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
the backlog over time should be going
 
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.970 align:start position:0%
the backlog over time should be going
declining

01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
declining
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
right and so so like today should be
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
much less than a year ago
 
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.129 align:start position:0%
much less than a year ago
so

01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
not really okay only because yes in
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
theory that would work but that would
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
mean that the number is static that
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
would mean that we wouldn't be taking in
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
any more charges so if you're cover if
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
you're if you're closing 25 or more
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
cases per month then yes over maybe a
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
year you would eradicate that backlog
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
right however if you are still opening
 
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
cases which we are it could be 10 one
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
month it could be 20 another month it
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
there's no particular number then those
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that number that is a sign that is
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
unassigned is going to continue to go up
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
even though with the five they are
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
moving through their cases more
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
efficiently they are um they're moving
 
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
through their cases more efficiently but
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop the number of of charges
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
that are coming in does that make sense
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
right but the number coming in is under
 
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
filed here right 193. correct correct
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
and the number closed 275 significantly
 
01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:36.290 align:start position:0%
and the number closed 275 significantly
more

01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
right so I'm not saying unassigned will
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
go to zero but just be 70 less or
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
something than it was a year ago it it
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
will however with more hands you are
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
assigning more cases to potentially have
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
more cases closed sure yes
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
yes so for example um January of this
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
year we filed there were 23 cases that
 
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
were filed so I'm reading from my notes
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
here okay sure I apologize so there were
 
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
23 cases that were filed there were 19
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
cases that were closed we got full
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
credit for 17 of the 19. two of them we
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
got an intake credit from the EEOC which
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
left our unassigned at 242.
 
01:36:21.659 --> 01:36:23.689 align:start position:0%
left our unassigned at 242.
however

01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
the next month we took in 16 so in
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
February last month we took in 16 cases
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
so right there you're already not you
 
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
haven't closed as many as you've taken
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
in that's right so there are some months
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
that you might close more than because
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
we're moving into the into the waiting
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
the pending cases and there are cases
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
where you close the same amount so the
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
pending has not been touched there are
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
times where you close less than for
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and you've now added to
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
the pending
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
so yes it will eventually decrease but
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that would take
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
without knowing how many you're going to
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
have come in how many you're going to
 
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
have leave how many staff members you
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
let me try one more different slightly
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
different way yeah thank you if if the
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
number being closed is higher than the
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
number coming in
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
with the current staff
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
right so your current staff is eating
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
into the backlog because they're closing
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
more cases than are coming in
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's not an indication that you
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
really need more staff
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
right more staff will eat through the
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
backlog even faster true but it but at
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
least you're you're with the current
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
in progress but I would disagree with
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
the premise that with current Staffing
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
we can eradicate this backlog and even
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
if we got it only and I hate to Hazard
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
this but only down to 50 that we're
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
waiting that's still a chunk of people
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
that are not getting what it is they're
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're needing we have
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we have an obligation to move through
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
these cases as expeditiously as possible
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
not to shortcut anyone but to certainly
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
move the move through them expeditiously
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so with more hands and the I know we
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
are focusing on the on the backlog here
 
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
and on the cases but that's not the only
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
part of our statute that we have to
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
address we are specifically tasked with
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach Education and Training and so
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is those things do happen and one
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
of the prioritized requests was a
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
training coordinator because what
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens now is with training it's either
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
myself or the assistant director who
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
stops what they're doing and does the
 
01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
specific training now important and
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
should be done more could be done again
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's back to the number of hands so
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
although yes the staff is amazing and
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
they do a great job however there are
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
other tasks that need to happen and
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
having more individuals who are moving
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
through these cases is really going to
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
give people back time if you are a
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
complainant and you have to wait you're
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
waiting so you don't know what's
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
happening with it maybe you've moved on
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
with your life maybe you're waiting for
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
this to finish so that you can move on
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
with your life for there to be a
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
determination of whether there was
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause that something
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
discriminatory happened or no probable
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
cause and if you're a business or
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
whoever the respondent is you're also
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
waiting you're waiting for someone to
 
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
make this decision so that you can move
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
on with your business life and so it
 
01:39:59.050 --> 01:39:59.060 align:start position:0%
would it would be
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental of me to not make this
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
request and looking at what we have and
 
01:40:07.729 --> 01:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
how we are allocating time and how we
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
are managing the caseload it does make
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
sense to ask for more people
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative evil
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um on page 22 where
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the remaining needs
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
for us to really dig in on this I
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could get us some
 
01:40:27.239 --> 01:40:28.430 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could get us some
numbers

01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
associated with these requests
 
01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
the numbers such as like
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount for the individual
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:44.870 align:start position:0%
this
I

01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.810 align:start position:0%
I
think

01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is this yep that sounds like and
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
then this is something you've got to add
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
in yeah
 
01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.129 align:start position:0%
in yeah
okay

01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to work with Kathy and
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
she's worked with us before as far as
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
actual breakdown of the new positions
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
sure and the costs of saints
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
all right I have I have this but I'll do
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
better math we have Kathy or you could
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
get those to the LBA folks that would be
 
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.330 align:start position:0%
get those to the LBA folks that would be
great

01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I I had a few questions myself
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
so for instance the unassigned uh how do
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
you prioritize those and how old are
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
those the unassigned cases
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the unassigned cases go in in order
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
so if something comes in uh what what
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
month is this March so if we opened a
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
charge on March the 7th that case is at
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the list so we go in order
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
of of how you walked in the door so we
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
start from the oldest cases moving
 
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:03.500 align:start position:0%
moving to the newest cases
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
we have people are waiting at least a
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
year before they are assigned and then a
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
case could take anywhere from three
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
months to maybe a year it depends on how
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
complex it is to have that investigated
 
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
or excuse me once it's investigated an
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
investigation could take anywhere from
 
01:42:26.410 --> 01:42:26.420 align:start position:0%
three months to a year it depends on how
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
on how complicated it is in the meantime
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
what we do offer we have a free media
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
program so initially out the box people
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
are offered this program we have around
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
50 close to 50 volunteer mediators that
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
work with us so there are retired judges
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys certified mediators and as
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
soon as anyone expresses interest they
 
01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:52.940 align:start position:0%
are immediately put in touch with our
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
mediator mediation coordinator that's
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
also one of the investigators to
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
schedule a mediation so we offer virtual
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
so that we're convenient to everyone and
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
then at any point in time if the two
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
parties would like to work towards a
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
settlement and they settle then their
 
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
their work with us is done we will then
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
at that point close the case because in
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
our understanding that person has been
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
made whole and and then that case is
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
closed so they don't have to wait on us
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
to do an investigation specifically to
 
01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
to enter into mediation and we make sure
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
that they know that's possible
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
so a significant amount of your funding
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
comes from General funds and I note here
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
that your request for
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'm 22 is about 830
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
000 in round numbers
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
and then up to a 1.2
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
million in round numbers for General
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
funds do you get a lot of federal help I
 
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
notice there is a line for federal
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars but it's about 175
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
000. are you able to get grants or
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
federal assistance that could help ease
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
the pain as far as the general funding
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
part of this thank you for the question
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
um right now uh with the EEOC which uh
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
which is our federal partner we work
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
sort of it's a weird kind of a
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so we we work the cases
 
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
and then we submit them and we get paid
 
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
in reimbursement or those cases we do
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
not have another Federal contract we are
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
currently beginning the work to connect
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
with HUD so that would be a different an
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
additional federal revenue stream that
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
one would work the same way though it
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
would be in a reimbursement type
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
situation so we would take in the charge
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
work the case and then submit that for
 
01:44:46.450 --> 01:44:46.460 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so that would be
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
significant funds whereas the
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um EEOC foreclosed case is around 800
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um HUD for a closed case could be
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from thirty two hundred to
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
thirty five hundred and depending on all
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the other things that you might do
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
there are other opportunities for income
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
um what we do also is with our trainings
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
we do charge for the trainings and so we
 
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
do bring in a meager amount maybe four
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
or five thousand depending on the year
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
could be less it could be more and that
 
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
money does go into the general fund and
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
if at any point
 
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
um if there are any fines that are
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
charged to any of the companies on the
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
outside on the other side of a hearing
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
then those dollars would go back to the
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
seeing non so I guess you're hopefully
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
clear on what we need again just work
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
with Kathy and get that to our LBA folks
 
01:45:46.739 --> 01:45:48.290 align:start position:0%
with Kathy and get that to our LBA folks
and

01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:50.060 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
further yeah I'm really sorry when when
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
you give us the information on the
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
remaining needs if you could tell us
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
which of those needs
 
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
reach the top of your list
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's like choosing among your children
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I know because because they're
 
01:46:08.110 --> 01:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
all the same
 
01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
all the same
[Laughter]

01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no and representative
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
evil is correct it's a significant one
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
from going from nine people now to 12 so
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
as far as what we look at we
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
try to minimize the number of new
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
employees if we can
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
understood just as an example our sister
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
stayed in Maine which is a similar
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
population size
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
um the their office staff is more than I
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
mean we're all small Maine New Hampshire
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island certainly but they have the
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
same number of of investigators and back
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
in 2011 we were cut down to six and and
 
01:46:51.729 --> 01:46:51.739 align:start position:0%
the need has continued to grow
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
so the this is why it's it's hard to say
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
one or two because just the more hands
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
the better I'm sure you're familiar with
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
the house subcommittee that took place
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
over the summer and we have others that
 
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
are certainly willing to to vouch that
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
we need more hands from the business
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
Community the legal Community Etc so
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
um I can sadly prioritize but it's going
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be hard because the four is really
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
what we need and we'll we're happy with
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
the three that the Governor has has
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
allotted us and if we could at least
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
that would that would make for a a
 
01:47:35.209 --> 01:47:35.219 align:start position:0%
really robust opportunity for us to dig
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
in and get this work done and move these
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
cases along
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you not seeing any further
 
01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%

director at the New Hampshire Council on
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
we are a 100 percent federally funded
 
01:50:56.570 --> 01:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
um our mission we are dedicated to
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
dignity full rights of citizenship
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
cultural diversity equal opportunities
 
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
and full participation for all New
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens with developmental
 
01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens with developmental
disabilities

01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the handout I have provided has three
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
things one is a description of our
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
organization it has the mission DD
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
councils were created by federal law
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
known as the DD act
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
and because there's a DD Council in
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
every state and territory we are
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:33.770 align:start position:0%
federally funded
um

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
are funding we receive we're what's
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
known as a minimum allotment state so we
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
receive about
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
527 thousand dollars a year currently
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
um to do our work and so it is
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
imperative for us to partner with other
 
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:54.260 align:start position:0%
organizations that have a similar vision
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
and values that of full inclusion and
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
Community participation for people with
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities we do
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
advocacy capacity building and systems
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
change work so we work with the state
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
with other disability Justice
 
01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.189 align:start position:0%
with other disability Justice
organizations

01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
um occasionally we do partner with other
 
01:52:19.689 --> 01:52:19.699 align:start position:0%
organizations and get some secondary
 
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
grant funding through those Partnerships
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
but it's very minimal
 
01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:26.750 align:start position:0%
but it's very minimal
um

01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh that is required by
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
the DD Act is that our membership be at
 
01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
least 60 percent individuals with
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
intellectual or developmental
 
01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
disabilities and this really guarantees
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
that our work is driven by the citizens
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
most impacted by our projects and our
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
activities we like to fund Innovative
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
projects and activities that really
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
um create an on-the-ground impact for
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so a large portion
 
01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:03.659 align:start position:0%
of our funding goes into what we call
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
our grants and scholarships so line
 
01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.370 align:start position:0%
our grants and scholarships so line
seven

01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.629 align:start position:0%
seven
um

01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
72 class 72 is where the bulk of our
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
funds typically go aside from salaries
 
01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:18.050 align:start position:0%
funds typically go aside from salaries
so

01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
um we are required to do A needs
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
assessment every five years to identify
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
the most pressing needs of citizens with
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities in New Hampshire so we do a
 
01:53:33.169 --> 01:53:33.179 align:start position:0%
lot of surveys a lot of focus groups we
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
are connected to a lot of family groups
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
the area agency system and we really
 
01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.250 align:start position:0%
the area agency system and we really
um

01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
try to incorporate
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
the findings that this needs assessment
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
into our five-year state plan
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
so and there's a visual representation
 
01:53:53.649 --> 01:53:53.659 align:start position:0%
of our state plan currently in process
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
we are in year two of our five-year
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
state plan
 
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing well
 
01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.450 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing well
so

01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:05.649 --> 01:54:05.659 align:start position:0%
um in our budget
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
the the only additional need was related
 
01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
to doit who had requested additional
 
01:54:19.689 --> 01:54:19.699 align:start position:0%
funds again our funds are all federal
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
and so it does not impact the general
 
01:54:25.689 --> 01:54:25.699 align:start position:0%
fund in any way
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
one other thing I would like to say is
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
that when we receive our Federal grant
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
so last year it was 527 thousand dollars
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
we have a two-year project period in
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
which to spend those funds and so that
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
allows us also to carry forward funds if
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
needed in cases of government shutdown
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution or in the unlikely
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
event that DD councils are unfunded it
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
would give us a wind down period to be
 
01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
able to expend those funds so currently
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
our carry forward is about two hundred
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which we have included
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget for the next biennium
 
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman did you lose an
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
experienced employee sometime recently
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
because one thing that's unusual about
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
your budget is the amount being spent in
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
the new biennium compared to the old the
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
the salary line is going down so there's
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
something yes thank you I haven't seen
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
that before thank you for the question
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
so we we
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
did have
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
um we had three full-time position
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
currently on the books
 
01:55:48.129 --> 01:55:48.139 align:start position:0%
um we did lose one employee
 
01:55:50.770 --> 01:55:50.780 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
and uh again the the health insurance
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
was a family insurance and it was
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
someone who was seasoned and so at a
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
higher uh pay rate than a new staff
 
01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
person would be we actually took that
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to break the position up
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
into two part-time positions because we
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
thought it would meet our needs
 
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
um more effectively and so so far so
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
good we're having trouble recruiting the
 
01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
second position but
 
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
um our hope is that so I think even
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
though full time went down part-time
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
I guess we're good
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mr Hoffman without objection
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
all right next we have the Department of
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
Labor that can be found on page 320 on
 
01:56:59.699 --> 01:57:00.590 align:start position:0%
Labor that can be found on page 320 on
the

01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
big budget book I'm sorry representative
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
Schultz that you don't have a big budget
 
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
that looks like
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's the numbers are all different oh my
 
01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
all right good morning welcome to

Department of Labor I'm joined by Deputy
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Rudy Ogden uh and as you
 
01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
say Mr chairman our section of the
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
budget begins on page 320.
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I just have some introductory remarks
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
and I know that you have questions uh
 
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
relative to House Bill 2
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
um so we'll leave the balance of the
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
time after that certainly for your
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh the Department of Labor
 
01:58:37.689 --> 01:58:37.699 align:start position:0%
consists of three operating divisions
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
Administration which is inclusive of
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
department-wide efforts like human
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
resources and finance inspection which
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
is tasked with the enforcement of the
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
state's employment safety elevator and
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
pressure vessel statutes and also the
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
Workers Compensation Division which is
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
tasked with monitoring the state's
 
01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
worker compensation system
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
the inspection division is responsible
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
for administering and enforcing the
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
protective legislation law citizens job

a variety of safety and health laws and
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
along with these the the associated
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
01:59:31.729 --> 01:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
um in each of the last three fiscal
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
years the Inspection Division division
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
has recovered an average of about a
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars in wages for New
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employees it has completed uh
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
roughly 500 labor inspections at various
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
businesses and completed uh ten thousand
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
or or more boiler and pressure vessel
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
inspections and over 5 000 elevator
 
01:59:54.719 --> 01:59:56.629 align:start position:0%
inspections and over 5 000 elevator
inspections

01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
the division is also proactive training
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
employers every year on employment law
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
to assist with businesses uh with with
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
their legal compliance with labor
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
statutes and as a consequence of the
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
public health emergency that began in
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
the year 2020 the division was forced to
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
develop and conduct remote electronic
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
trainings but we are making an effort
 
02:00:24.729 --> 02:00:24.739 align:start position:0%
this spring to return to in-person
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
training events all over the state for
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
Employers in various parts of the state
 
02:00:29.699 --> 02:00:31.370 align:start position:0%
Employers in various parts of the state
geographically

02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
geographically
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh the Workers Compensation Division was
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
created in 1947 has the responsibility
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
for administering the state's work of
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
compensation law which is RSA 281a this
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
law was originally enacted in 1911 and
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
requires employers to maintain insurance
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
coverage to provide no-fault workers
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
compensation for employees in the case
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
of accidental injury death or
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
occupational disease arising out of the
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
the course of their employment
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
among other duties the Workers
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division collects first
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
reports of injury from employers or
 
02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers numbering about forty
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
thousand a year
 
02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
it also schedules over 1500 formal
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
hearings per year and manages a
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
revolving trust fund Collections and
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
payments of as high as 20 million
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
dollars a year which as you can see is
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
about twice the size of our operating
 
02:01:30.119 --> 02:01:32.450 align:start position:0%
about twice the size of our operating
budget

02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
while the Department's total
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations however are funded 100
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
percent by agency income that revenue is
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
derived through two distinct sources the
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
administration fund and the restricted
 
02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:47.629 align:start position:0%
administration fund and the restricted
fund

02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
the administration fund is described in
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 281 a colon 59 and it comes from a
 
02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
pro rata assessment of the Department's
 
02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
annual budget for workers compensation
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
activities and that is levied on
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and self-insured
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
entities in New Hampshire and that that
 
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
part of our agency income represents
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
about 88 percent of our biennial Revenue
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
requests that's before you the
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
restricted fund that is described in RSA
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
273 colon 1B comes from the sum of all
 
02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:28.850 align:start position:0%
273 colon 1B comes from the sum of all
other

02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
fees licenses certificates and civil
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
penalties of the department
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
the ballot and then the balance of the
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
restricted fund at the end of each
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is transferred to the
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
general fund so once once all of our
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
activities are paid for the balance goes
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the department has happily reported
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
record revenues in general fund
 
02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
transfers in each of the last two years
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
exceeding two million dollars for the
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
first time in fiscal 21 and 3 million
 
02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal 22.
 
02:03:07.330 --> 02:03:07.340 align:start position:0%
uh in our biennial agency request
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded agencies were not required
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
to meet the governor's efficiency
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
expenditure targets but the labor
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
department has done so nonetheless
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
um in our 2024 efficiency request
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
governor's office provided an overall
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
efficiency Target of just over 11
 
02:03:29.290 --> 02:03:29.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars in year one
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
representing a three percent increase
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
from 23 adjusted authorized and the uh
 
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
adjusted year two target was 11.25
 
02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
Million with allowances for position
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
cost increases
 
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
again we met both of those targets with
 
02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
our efficiency budget request and apart
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
from certain priority needs that were
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
requested by other agencies as a
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
transfer from us all of our requests
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
were were accepted by the governor
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
we have requested no new positions for
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 24-25 having abolished
 
02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.219 align:start position:0%
eight full-time positions in the last
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
biennium but the governor's expenditure
 
02:04:17.689 --> 02:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
targets did allow us to fully fund all
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
remaining 86 full-time permanent
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
positions in our budget
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
other operational changes that we've
 
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
requested in our agency budget include
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
the addition of a new class 103 for
 
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
contracts and we envision using the
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
using this for certain operational needs
 
02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
we've traditionally historically the
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
labor department has not had contract
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
lines in the budget and we have run into
 
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
certain needs there so we've we've asked
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
for a new uh budget line for contracts
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're also requesting a new board
 
02:04:57.490 --> 02:04:57.500 align:start position:0%
expenses class 65 as a companion to
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
language in House Bill 2 that will allow
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
us to pay per diem members of an
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
important administratively attached
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
board that is has presented some
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
recruitment difficulties for us
 
02:05:14.689 --> 02:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
um so we've asked for a new uh pay line
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
there for that board and we've also
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
increased the amount of money available
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
for employee training due to concerns
 
02:05:24.169 --> 02:05:24.179 align:start position:0%
that we've had in recent years over
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
staff turnover uh and and in addition an
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
ongoing technology launch new technology
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
launch in the department and speaking of
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
that uh priority funding included by the
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
governor in both years of the biennium
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
includes about 135 thousand dollars per
 
02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
year for doit services
 
02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
largely in support of the Department's
 
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
first new technology launch uh in some
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
20 years the intent there the intent
 
02:05:59.050 --> 02:05:59.060 align:start position:0%
there is to replace an aging 1980s IBM
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
as400 system which I believe is going to
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
be the last one in operation in state
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
government if it isn't already
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
so we're replacing that we did launch a
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
new document management system a little
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
more than a year ago and we are
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
gradually moving functions off of the
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
IBM and onto this new system
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
and so that concludes my remarks we're
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions here
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire and thank you Mr
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I don't know who's more
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
behind on technology you were the liquor
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
department but I'm going to say it's us
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they they're replacing a 40
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
year old system as well so there you go
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me uh in the Inspection
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
Division why is the number of boiler
 
02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:51.659 align:start position:0%
inspections vary so much from year to
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
year well I think if you're looking at
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the statistics that we've provided in
 
02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
the statistics that we've provided in
2020

02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.330 align:start position:0%
2020
and

02:06:59.330 --> 02:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page five of your handout
 
02:07:04.129 --> 02:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
right right from the handout uh
 
02:07:08.089 --> 02:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2020 still coping with
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh effects of the pandemic uh many of
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
many employers many uh device owners did
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
not want us in their buildings I see so
 
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
2020 got pushed into 21 so 21 was big
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and now we're back to normal
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes relatively normal yes gotcha okay
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and one more question
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
I remember from my last stint as a State
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Rep that our workman's comp rates were
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
considerably higher than Massachusetts
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
is that true to choose it's being a
 
02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
different model
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the the structure of the workers
 
02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
compensation system in Massachusetts is
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
very different in fact the the national
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse of statistics for workers
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
compensation does not include
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in their statistics at all
 
02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
because of the the different way that
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
they fund their system so how do we rank
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
sort of nationally or I don't know how
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
we rank but well insurance is probably
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
the better source of information on this
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
but rates have been declining over
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
recent years but if you could use the
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
mic I'm sorry the rates have been
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
declining but I would say relative to
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
the costs under workers compensation we
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
Trend High
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
um there was as you might remember from
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
your time discussion of a fee schedule
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
things of that nature we do not have a
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
fee schedule accordingly if you look at
 
02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
again to the commissioner's Point
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is not included in these
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
statistics but if you look at us even
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
regionally the provider payment rates
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
are are high in New Hampshire for
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
workers compensation yeah we have
 
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:43.940 align:start position:0%
expensive hospitals and Etc
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
and you might remember uh legislation
 
02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:51.659 align:start position:0%
that was passed oh boy I forget what
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
year this was it was prior to my arrival
 
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:55.139 align:start position:0%
of labor but
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
um there was legislation passed uh
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
creating uh section 24 of the workers
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
compensation statute that um shifted the
 
02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
burden of proof to the providers about
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
the reasonableness of cost and that was
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
that was uh compromised to to avoid
 
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
going to a full fee schedule versus the
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
the prior system with with those burdens
 
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
of proof were were reversed
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz and on a summer
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
similar note where do we rank in
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation say on the
 
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
lower end average compared to all the
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
other states I I wish I could tell you
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
but that's not under our purview
 
02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
employment security has purview for
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment okay so that's not under
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
you yeah it doesn't fall in our business
 
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's the lowest in the
 
02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
country for whatever it's worth
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
no apology necessary or new to the
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
not understood that the common comments
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
that many states have combined those
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
functions in the labor department but
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
here it's more fragmented
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
several agencies so you have a number of
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
issues in House Bill 2 which yes we
 
02:10:14.209 --> 02:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
spoke to yesterday I Mr Hoffman and
 
02:10:14.219 --> 02:10:20.089 align:start position:0%
spoke to yesterday I Mr Hoffman and
Melissa

02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.099 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
um on pages 39 to 42 there's sections
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
111 through 1 8. teen have to do with
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
we have 111 this civil penalties
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
I can describe what we're what we're
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish there uh
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
you might remember from my remarks I
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
talked about the two primary sources of
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
revenue at the labor department being
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
the restricted fund of the
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
administration Fund in 2011 the
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature created the restricted fund
 
02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:12.530 align:start position:0%
legislature created the restricted fund
to

02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:13.070 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
to fund all activities of the department
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
that were not associated with workers
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
compensation and so every civil penalty
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
every uh certificate license fee
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
everything else we collect besides the
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
administration fund was directed into
 
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
the restricted fund and the statute
 
02:11:34.450 --> 02:11:34.460 align:start position:0%
literally says all
 
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not every passage in the
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
statutes was corrected at that time and
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
so this turned up these turned up well
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
one or two of these turned up in an LBA
 
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
audit this past year the Deputy
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner also did a more thorough
 
02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:53.900 align:start position:0%
search of the statutes looking for any
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
misdirected funds that should be
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
directed to the restricted fund as
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
intended by the legislature in 2011. so
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
it is literally clean up of yeah
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea what the general
 
02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
fund would lose if we didn't change this
 
02:12:10.139 --> 02:12:11.109 align:start position:0%
fund would lose if we didn't change this
language

02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
not a thing because the balance is being
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
sent to the general fund anyway the the
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
applicable uh penalties that we're
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
describing here are far less than what
 
02:12:30.189 --> 02:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
we turn over to the general fund
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
Sony concerns about 111 and we have I
 
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
guess 112 which is workers compensation
 
02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
guess 112 which is workers compensation
liability

02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
and then going down 113
 
02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:48.290 align:start position:0%
and then going down 113
114

02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
114
 
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
114 units
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
I guess it's still under the labor isn't
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
and and if I might just comment uh on
 
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
Section 114 what we've done there is to
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
it we we have on the workers
 
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
compensation side of the house we have
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
in a pellet board who we pay in exactly
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
the same way and so we've lifted the
 
02:13:19.010 --> 02:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Has Lifted the
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
language uh from that statute to place
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
it under the penalty appeal board
 
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
because we're having difficulty well in
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
fact as long ago as 1995 the lva cited
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
the department for not turning out
 
02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
decisions from the penalty appeals board
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion and we have had
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
difficulty recruiting for this as a as a
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
volunteer position so we think it's
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
important for people to be able to
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
appeal decisions of the commissioner
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
relative to penalties and this board uh
 
02:13:58.089 --> 02:13:58.099 align:start position:0%
we think we we need to inspire people to
 
02:14:00.770 --> 02:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
participate in this board
 
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
participate in this board
so

02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh what you said you
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
were conforming this to which board the
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board okay
 
02:14:18.010 --> 02:14:18.020 align:start position:0%
uh which is a 33-member pool uh they sit
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
in uh appeals of decisions of our
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
hearings Bureau they sit in three-member
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
tribunals to determine uh uh
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
compensibility and other issues
 
02:14:31.609 --> 02:14:31.619 align:start position:0%
associated with worker compensation
 
02:14:31.619 --> 02:14:32.810 align:start position:0%
associated with worker compensation
cases

02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
when there's been an appeal and they are
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
any problem with 114
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
um so because we're going to give them
 
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
give this per diem uh what do you think
 
02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
the expense of the board how much will
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
um we estimated that and included it in
 
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.050 --> 02:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh 20 000 per year okay is what we're
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
estimating uh far less busy than the
 
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board which you'll
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
see is hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
a year so I'm guessing that workman's
 
02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
comp rates are set such that they
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
generate what your budget needs is it is
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
that right or is it
 
02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
or is it the other way around you you
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
manage your budget
 
02:15:40.129 --> 02:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
to get what the rates give you
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh well our our budget as approved by
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
the general court is an assessment for
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
for just for workers compensation
 
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
activities right so then we bill that to
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers on a pro-rata
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
basis based on the claims that they have
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
paid in the prior year
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
um relative to rates it has much more to
 
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
do with their experience you know what
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
claims have they paid and so forth set
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
by the insurance department right right
 
02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
I mean correct their rates are primarily
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
driven on their experience and whether
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
they've had what their loss experience
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
has been in preceding years oh okay so
 
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
so we set your budget here
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's the amount you have to ask them
 
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
for is that you build them for that
 
02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
correct they they figure it out right
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely for for what it's worth it's
 
02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
negligible compared to the amount of
 
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
claims paid sure
 
02:16:44.089 --> 02:16:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
do you mind repeating which
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
um board it is that you are eager to
 
02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
have volunteers for because I that we
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
had have a problem yeah with uh yes the
 
02:16:57.169 --> 02:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
penalty appeals board
 
02:17:00.250 --> 02:17:00.260 align:start position:0%
they they hear appeals of decision
 
02:17:03.530 --> 02:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
Decisions by my office relative to civil
 
02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:05.450 align:start position:0%
Decisions by my office relative to civil
penalties

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
02:17:08.209 --> 02:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
um in a variety of circumstances but
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to appeal that
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
um and what we have been left to is to
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
settling cases
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
um with folks rather rather than going
 
02:17:25.089 --> 02:17:25.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
so next we have 115 a workers
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
compensation payment for a second
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
injuries from a special fund
 
02:17:33.359 --> 02:17:34.549 align:start position:0%
injuries from a special fund
uh

02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
again this looks a little
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
deep on the first read have you run any
 
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
of these uh by the labor committee by
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
chance to get there
 
02:17:46.370 --> 02:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
position on it sometimes we refer it if
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's a policy issue that catches our
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
attention we ask the policy committee to
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
weigh in I can say that we've had
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
discussions with the chairman of Labor
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh and also the Attorney General's
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
office and the governor's office for
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
years about this I could I could offer
 
02:18:07.089 --> 02:18:07.099 align:start position:0%
that the the second injury funds
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the country 2022 states have
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
ended their second injury funds
 
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.129 align:start position:0%
ended their second injury funds
um

02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's been the extent of our
 
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
discussions with house labors actually
 
02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
with the chairman
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz here on labor
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
right normally does anything look
 
02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
familiar to you here or I'm still new to
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the labor committee so I mean it's
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
always nice to talk to the ranking
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
member of the minority party too I would
 
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
say but um
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the labor Committee
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:47.780 align:start position:0%
well so we'll assign you if you could
 
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
check with your colleagues on the labor
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
committee about section 115 please it
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
might be happy to get back to us very
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
shortly I feel well tasked thank you I
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
sit behind the chair and vice chair I
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
could lean on over and ask on Thursday
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
we try to stick with money but when we
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
see policy we try to reach out to the
 
02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.410 --> 02:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah so the upshot
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
though of 115 is you're getting rid of
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
the second injury we would be sunsetting
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
new claims new claims and if I could
 
02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
give you uh
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
an example from my research the the
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
state of Connecticut did almost
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
precisely the same thing in 1995 their
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
fund is still operating today
 
02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
so it's a very gradual departure from
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
in the case so represents Schultz you
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
have an assignment there how about 116
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
for family medical leave Insurance sure
 
02:19:55.380 --> 02:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
for family medical leave Insurance sure
um

02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
the the Family and Medical Leave
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions in
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
the prior House Bill too
 
02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
addressed one part of our statute
 
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
so it's a prohibited activity for an
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
employer who signs on to the program to
 
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
retaliate or discriminate against an
 
02:20:22.730 --> 02:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
employee who uses the program
 
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
what wasn't clear to us however was
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
how how the labor department was
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to properly react to complaints
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
about that so we're just we're asking
 
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
for rule making Authority so that we can
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
Define that more clearly
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
we know that it's a prohibited act but
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
how does the the labor department
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
respond do we uh do we offer a hearing
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
do we accept a hearing do we investigate
 
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we just wanted to clarify
 
02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:55.309 align:start position:0%
um you know we just wanted to clarify
that

02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
can quit questions from anybody on 116
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you is the
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
amount you that the employer might be
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
fined or something is that known or
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
probably not we have a statute that
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
grants us uh twenty five hundred dollars
 
02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
maximum per violation that would
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
probably be applied in this case
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
um that would be my expectation really
 
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't try to Define if
 
02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.389 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't try to Define if
fine

02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
so are we okay with 116.
 
02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
so are we okay with 116.
okay

02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
now we have the boiler and pressure
 
02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.490 align:start position:0%
now we have the boiler and pressure
vessels

02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:36.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're attempting to
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish there is the correction of a
 
02:21:43.969 --> 02:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
scrivener's error that we believe
 
02:21:46.210 --> 02:21:46.220 align:start position:0%
happened in 1988
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
just catching up to it yeah not as old
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
as you know we tutor though
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we tend to find these things on
 
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.429 align:start position:0%
yeah we tend to find these things on
occasion

02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
um we believe that the statute the
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
statute changed in 1988 because a small
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
section was added and we believe that
 
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
the the published version of the law
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
changed the word from and to or vice
 
02:22:11.929 --> 02:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
versa and uh we don't believe that that
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
was the result of any legislative action
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
it was simply an error so that's all
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to uh accomplish here all
 
02:22:23.570 --> 02:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
right so I guess we'll say Mr Hoffman on
 
02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:25.969 align:start position:0%
right so I guess we'll say Mr Hoffman on
117.

02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
117.
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
and here we go workman's comp uh appeals
 
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
and here we go workman's comp uh appeals
board

02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
um uh it's been
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's been noted in in our statistics uh
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
over quite some time uh more than a
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
decade that the volume associated with
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
appeals at the workers compensation
 
02:23:01.570 --> 02:23:01.580 align:start position:0%
appeals board has been declining
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
the 33-member pool was established quite
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
a long time ago decades ago when there
 
02:23:10.969 --> 02:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
was a huge backlog from the superior
 
02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
court that needed to be addressed we we
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we need 33 seeds on
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
this board in order to accomplish the
 
02:23:23.929 --> 02:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.939 --> 02:23:28.190 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
evening

02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think that's it
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much okay thank you
 
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.220 --> 02:25:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.640 --> 03:31:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:31:32.929 --> 03:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.450 --> 03:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%

um so Corrections is our largest
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
the corrections appreciate the
 
03:33:32.450 --> 03:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the budget uh to
 
03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
my right is John Hanson our director of
 
03:33:34.500 --> 03:33:35.630 align:start position:0%
my right is John Hanson our director of
administration

03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
in the packet we point out our mission
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
statement on page one and the areas we
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
are uh statutory obligated to facilitate
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
which include running the correctional
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
facilities probation parole victim
 
03:33:50.809 --> 03:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
services and acting and advisory
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
capacity with other law enforcement
 
03:33:52.380 --> 03:33:56.269 align:start position:0%
capacity with other law enforcement
agencies

03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
on page two we give a high level
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
overview of the FY 2425 Governor's
 
03:34:04.610 --> 03:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a surprise to this
 
03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
committee that a large portion of our
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
budget is salaries and benefits in FY 24
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that represents 73.3 and an fy25 73.7
 
03:34:18.290 --> 03:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
percent of the budget
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
the other area of the budget that is a
 
03:34:23.210 --> 03:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
larger component obviously in the
 
03:34:25.130 --> 03:34:25.140 align:start position:0%
delivery of Health Care Services to
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated residents they have a they
 
03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
are the only population who has a
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate Access to Health Care from
 
03:34:37.849 --> 03:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
any citizen in the United States of
 
03:34:40.550 --> 03:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
America so our medical budget represents
 
03:34:44.570 --> 03:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
12.8 percent in FY 24 and 12.6 percent
 
03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
12.8 percent in FY 24 and 12.6 percent
fy25

03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
fy25
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
the other operational costs will go
 
03:34:50.090 --> 03:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
through those those that are greater
 
03:34:52.010 --> 03:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
than a million and less than a million
 
03:34:54.530 --> 03:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
but you'll see in the table Below on
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
page two we highlight the actual the
 
03:34:59.809 --> 03:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized for FY 23 and the
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended in the two
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
following years
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you would the commissioner I I'm
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
looking at a discrepancy here between
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
your 149 3 and what I see on page 534 of
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
um 155 6. so is there some attached
 
03:35:24.050 --> 03:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
thing or something like that maybe the
 
03:35:26.809 --> 03:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
Adult Parole Board numbers
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.570 --> 03:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
the pro board is about 6 million total
 
03:35:41.850 --> 03:35:41.860 align:start position:0%
six no no not people million
 
03:35:41.860 --> 03:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
six no no not people million
[Laughter]

03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:46.429 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
dollars

03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah oh the numbers on the slide I know
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
we raised his salary a few dollars but
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
numbers on the slide on page to just
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
represent general fund dollars so the
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
numbers within the budget will include
 
03:36:04.849 --> 03:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
um Grant dollars and some other dollars
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
including the adult parole board thank
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.090 --> 03:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh on page two you'll take notice that
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
the areas we see increasing obviously
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
your salary and benefits prescription
 
03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
drugs and medical payments to providers
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the up and coming years
 
03:36:26.330 --> 03:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
and then obviously utilities I think as
 
03:36:28.130 --> 03:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
individuals paying our own electric
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
bills as you could imagine we talked the
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
last time the utility cost across the
 
03:36:37.130 --> 03:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
on page three we dive into the salary
 
03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
and benefits specifically for 973
 
03:36:46.969 --> 03:36:46.979 align:start position:0%
full-time funded positions we've
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
allocated 5.49 million in the overtime
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
line and would ask for continued use of
 
03:36:55.849 --> 03:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
a footnote that we've used that looks at
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
all of the lines associated with
 
03:37:00.650 --> 03:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
personnel and allow us to through the
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and governor and
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
Council transfer funds to fill in over
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
time that is incurred through vacancies
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
well that has worked really well and I
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
again I think it's an appropriate way to
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
say to the Department of Corrections
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
continue to fill those vacancies and
 
03:37:17.809 --> 03:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
give hope to the staff that are working
 
03:37:20.090 --> 03:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
every day that will be able to continue
 
03:37:21.950 --> 03:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
and move that needle forward in a
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.190 --> 03:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh on page four we drill down into the
 
03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
medical and Pharmacy budget not included
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
on here I do want to let the committee
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
know that the agency was able to move
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
forward with some 340b pricing on
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals which is a a significant
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
savings we partnered with health and
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
human services and started to move that
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
needle forward to look at things such as
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C Pharmaceuticals which are
 
03:37:51.290 --> 03:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
higher cost and as we become more expert
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
in that area we'll roll in other
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals because there are heavy
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements and we want to
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
make sure we serve the state right in
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that regard as well as save money
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
we do ask on page four to highlight and
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
to continue to have that footnote health
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
care costs are definitely unpredictable
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
disease states are unpredictable and
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
being able to come back for unknown
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances or Market circumstances to
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal and GNC to ask for additional
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
on page five highlight areas in the 9.6
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
percent range of the general fund budget
 
03:38:32.330 --> 03:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
our food services it might surprise you
 
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
that every day we serve 5 700 meals
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
across the agency at an average cost per
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
meal of 375 per day so although those
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
costs are going up I think we've
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
controlled them given the nature of the
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
economy in a way that's reasonable
 
03:38:51.290 --> 03:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
the consumables area current expense
 
03:38:53.469 --> 03:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise class 20 commonly referred to
 
03:38:56.450 --> 03:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
those numbers go up slightly the cost of
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
things do cost more
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
the other area that um we we put some
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
attention to is our equipment or class
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
30 costs we continue to need to upgrade
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
our Fleet we spent the last several
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
years upgrading our Field Services Fleet
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
our most community-based mobile Fleet
 
03:39:17.570 --> 03:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
and now we need to shift course and look
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
at our transportation vehicles our other
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance and logistic vehicle
 
03:39:25.490 --> 03:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
vehicles that go back as early as I
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
think our oldest one is from the 80s
 
03:39:29.809 --> 03:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
maybe late 80s yeah so we need to put
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
some attention to those the other area
 
03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
we don't commonly talk about but it is
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
time to again invest in equipment are in
 
03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
our infirmary Suites our hospital beds
 
03:39:40.130 --> 03:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
the resources our Health Care staff use
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to care for people
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
who are informed and we need to address
 
03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
those as well as continuing to look for
 
03:39:48.650 --> 03:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the delivery of our
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and reduce any type of
 
03:39:52.490 --> 03:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
medication error opportunity through
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
on page six we dive into utility costs
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh we did send some information after
 
03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
the last agency briefing but we
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
highlight an example of the definite
 
03:40:10.429 --> 03:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
significant changes in our utilities
 
03:40:12.650 --> 03:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
costs and new to the agency but
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
similarly for administrative Services we
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
ask for the inclusion of a opportunity
 
03:40:19.969 --> 03:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
to come back if utility costs exceed
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
what's forecasted and put in our budget
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
from admin Services I think that's
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
reasonable given what we've seen the
 
03:40:29.290 --> 03:40:29.300 align:start position:0%
last year an unexpected
 
03:40:31.610 --> 03:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
forecasting in the future
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
so the hope would be to save money but
 
03:40:34.610 --> 03:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
in the event that we don't have enough
 
03:40:36.050 --> 03:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
money that you will have the
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
understanding we'll go through the
 
03:40:38.929 --> 03:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
fiscal and GDC process to ask for
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
so I've noticed under utilities you've
 
03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:46.510 align:start position:0%
so I've noticed under utilities you've
been

03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
been able to reduce the usage over time
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
it looks like pretty well is that mainly
 
03:40:57.889 --> 03:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
related to fewer inmates I think you
 
03:41:00.170 --> 03:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
could make that a logical link that the
 
03:41:02.210 --> 03:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
reduction in incarcerated population has
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
reduced some of those costs great thank
 
03:41:06.889 --> 03:41:06.899 align:start position:0%
you yeah and some increases in LED
 
03:41:09.889 --> 03:41:09.899 align:start position:0%
lighting and small Nuance changes we've
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
tried to implement thank you for that
 
03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:12.769 align:start position:0%
tried to implement thank you for that
question

03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:15.769 --> 03:41:15.779 align:start position:0%
under office of Information Technology
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
expenses you'll see those costs for FY
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 part of heavy initiatives
 
03:41:23.690 --> 03:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're trying to use and look at are the
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
uses of technology to help the
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our staffing situation but
 
03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
also to create Bridges to education and
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
other rehabilitative programs and not
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
try to do it all ourselves in that for
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
example we are part of the authorization
 
03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of the Pell Grant and
 
03:41:42.410 --> 03:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're working with a New England
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
Commission on higher education and
 
03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
prisons as well as a group called
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
evolving prisons and connected
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
communities and some of these
 
03:41:51.250 --> 03:41:51.260 align:start position:0%
initiatives both allow us to create
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
technological resources for our staff
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
but also technological paths for staff
 
03:41:58.010 --> 03:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
to provide education and other treatment
 
03:42:00.889 --> 03:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities Wellness is an issue not
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
just for people incarcerated but for the
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
staff they're working every day and
 
03:42:06.410 --> 03:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to create new and
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
Progressive Pathways forward to give
 
03:42:10.729 --> 03:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
them opportunities on their break to
 
03:42:12.349 --> 03:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
check in if they need a Telehealth visit
 
03:42:14.330 --> 03:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
or a wellness visit for their own
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
benefit and we want to be a better
 
03:42:19.130 --> 03:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
partner in their own work-life balance
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
so some of these initiatives move that
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
forward an important tool and
 
03:42:24.290 --> 03:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
Corrections is also the radio
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
telecommunications system that is a
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
critical tool a safety tool and so what
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
this item also works to both fix the
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
hardware situation software situations
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
associated with an analog system and
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
moving to a digital system
 
03:42:40.190 --> 03:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we want to get off
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
paper I see a lot of paper in this room
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
but if you can imagine we keep a still
 
03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
more paper than we need on residents
 
03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
files and we want to move that to a
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
digital system and get to a more
 
03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
efficient system and Corrections
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um trying to highlight we do use General
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
applications uh vendor management system
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
an electronic health record an
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
electronic pharmaceutical system we are
 
03:43:08.030 --> 03:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at other systems again to create
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
progress both from an incident reporting
 
03:43:13.370 --> 03:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
as well as use of fiscal Force reporting
 
03:43:15.290 --> 03:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
system to make sure we are as
 
03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible when one of
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
those events happens and we can expedite
 
03:43:21.650 --> 03:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
that type of review mitigating the time
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
one of our staff might be out under
 
03:43:26.090 --> 03:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
investigation and getting them back
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
return to the environment because we can
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
swiftly and show exactly what happened
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
we further have deployed when I get
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself I was about to I'll wait
 
03:43:37.250 --> 03:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
till I get to the next page
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
um on the following page these are other
 
03:43:42.530 --> 03:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
notable changes in the budget book our
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
rents and leases for our district
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
offices have gone up but in addition to
 
03:43:49.130 --> 03:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
that we're making a we're asking to make
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
a change in this budget to lease tasers
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
energy conducted weapons as they're
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
referred to I learned early on taking
 
03:43:59.210 --> 03:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
the Helm of this agency that we bought
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
them and that's also not a way to stay
 
03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:03.779 align:start position:0%
on top of technology in its expensive
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
way in a liable way to maintain
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
technology but they have a leasing
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
program where you lease them the shelf
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
life is not something you're tracking
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
but they also provide training and other
 
03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
resources when you you move that way so
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
this looks to lease about 106 tasers
 
03:44:21.530 --> 03:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
across the whole organization we changed
 
03:44:23.690 --> 03:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
this already in our Field Services
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
Department it's been very effective now
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
we want to do this in our correctional
 
03:44:28.319 --> 03:44:29.690 align:start position:0%
we want to do this in our correctional
facilities

03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:44:31.729 --> 03:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
a question from representative Sweeney
 
03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here so what would
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
be the cost to buy 106 tasers as opposed
 
03:44:44.889 --> 03:44:44.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
approximately three thousand dollars
 
03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:51.469 align:start position:0%
approximately three thousand dollars
taser

03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
taser
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
Schultz sorry
 
03:45:01.020 --> 03:45:01.969 align:start position:0%
Schultz sorry
um

03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money I have no idea
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
that they were that expensive yes for
 
03:45:07.969 --> 03:45:07.979 align:start position:0%
whatever it's worth I bought one from
 
03:45:12.490 --> 03:45:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is a different kind of thankfully I
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
haven't used it and I've never brought
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
it to the legislature maybe if you would
 
03:45:20.690 --> 03:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
admit that either
 
03:45:20.700 --> 03:45:21.610 align:start position:0%
admit that either
um

03:45:21.610 --> 03:45:21.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:25.370 --> 03:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm just surprised though uh from
 
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
that research that I did on my own that
 
03:45:30.290 --> 03:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
teaser technology would change that much
 
03:45:30.300 --> 03:45:31.550 align:start position:0%
teaser technology would change that much
over

03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:45:33.769 --> 03:45:33.779 align:start position:0%
the short term
 
03:45:33.779 --> 03:45:35.090 align:start position:0%
the short term
um

03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:37.190 --> 03:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
I guess that's not a question but it
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
just seems like a lot per taser for if
 
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
you have working tasers what is I guess
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
I guess the question would be then
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
what's the biggest difference then
 
03:45:49.190 --> 03:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
between an old taser that you already
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
own and one of these new tasers of
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
course setting aside the training
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
benefit you get from that arrangement
 
03:45:59.090 --> 03:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz that's a great
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
question and uh the tasers themselves
 
03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
actually have an expiration date and I
 
03:46:06.050 --> 03:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
did not know that until I worked in
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
Corrections the taser you have at home
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
versus the taser we use in a law
 
03:46:11.150 --> 03:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement environment has an
 
03:46:13.490 --> 03:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
expiration date it has
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
um technology within the software that
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
actually gets uh outdated over time
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
because it actually tracks when those uh
 
03:46:23.570 --> 03:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
barbs and its usage as well as it has a
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
video apparatus on the device to
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
videotape that event as well so there's
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
all of these systems of redundancy
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
within the system another area just as
 
03:46:35.090 --> 03:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
an example that I didn't realize came
 
03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
with a expiration date it's also a stab
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
resistant vest I would have thought in
 
03:46:41.330 --> 03:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
layman's terms prior to my law
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement experience that that best is
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
always good it expires the other
 
03:46:49.610 --> 03:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
important factor in handing a
 
03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
corrections officer an expired taser and
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
then being in a use of fiscal Force
 
03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
event is the liability of not having
 
03:46:57.769 --> 03:46:57.779 align:start position:0%
current and effective technology that's
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
backed in litigation
 
03:47:00.969 --> 03:47:00.979 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
what about the consumables part of the
 
03:47:05.690 --> 03:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
taser does that include it in the lease
 
03:47:07.610 --> 03:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
or you have to buy that that's all of it
 
03:47:10.250 --> 03:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
is all inclusives uh in the lease that's
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
a great question too yeah
 
03:47:14.809 --> 03:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
um the other area of the department
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
obviously Staffing is critical in order
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
to attract and recruit staff and retain
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
staff employee development is an area
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
this agency took the opportunity this
 
03:47:27.769 --> 03:47:27.779 align:start position:0%
budget to really put dollars behind and
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
it might not look like a lot at the end
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the day averaging about 205 dollars
 
03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
per person but we haven't invested a lot
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
in employee training and that
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
information technology is also to create
 
03:47:41.450 --> 03:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
Pathways to training because we need to
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
be realistic about how much in-person
 
03:47:45.650 --> 03:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
training we can offer and how much that
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
offer we also need to build the skill
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
sets of those working Behind the Walls
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
and risk assessing Crisis Intervention
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
training not just responding to a mental
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
health event but being a peer supporter
 
03:47:58.210 --> 03:47:58.220 align:start position:0%
within a correctional environment
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
motivational interviewing skills
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental law enforcement skills
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
including firearms and advanced firearms
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
training and then buying the training
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
materials as even down to the
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
ammunitions we require all come out of
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
this funding line and we really wanted
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
to put a mark on employee development
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
employee training across the Diversified
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
areas because we have law enforcement
 
03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
employees we have clinical employees we
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
have case management employees probation
 
03:48:23.809 --> 03:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
and parole officer employees we have
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
teachers we have a community of
 
03:48:27.769 --> 03:48:27.779 align:start position:0%
Professional Services that we need to be
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
investing in and and that's what these
 
03:48:31.490 --> 03:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
numbers represent
 
03:48:34.130 --> 03:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to other notable changes
 
03:48:36.769 --> 03:48:36.779 align:start position:0%
in the for the agency is ongoing
 
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
expenses for the current procurement of
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
body and vehicle cameras and in addition
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
to an employee Wellness application and
 
03:48:47.330 --> 03:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
victim information and notification
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
every day we referred to as Vine
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
software that vine software is for
 
03:48:53.210 --> 03:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors of crime in a
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
self-service technology way to say how
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and when they want to be notified about
 
03:48:59.150 --> 03:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
the person who's incarcerated through
 
03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:00.429 align:start position:0%
the person who's incarcerated through
email

03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
email
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
telephonic and or other methods of
 
03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
communication and the when is important
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't necessarily want to know
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the time what's going on but when
 
03:49:10.729 --> 03:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
somebody's accessing the community and
 
03:49:13.250 --> 03:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
everywhere in between so these expenses
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
are outlined under contract for program
 
03:49:18.170 --> 03:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
services and show a notable change from
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
on page eight I highlight our house
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 requests under the
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended again the
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
transfer Authority that allows us to
 
03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:33.590 align:start position:0%
transfer Authority that allows us to
help

03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:49:35.929 --> 03:49:35.939 align:start position:0%
fill in the overtime expenses due to
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
vacancies and then the
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page eight starts a series
 
03:49:43.849 --> 03:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
of currently classified positions
 
03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
seeking to make them unclassified
 
03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
positions so if you will these are
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
classified Deputy directors both Deputy
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
Warden deputy director of rehabilitative
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
services and a deputy director of Health
 
03:49:59.570 --> 03:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
Services we run 24 7 facilities it only
 
03:50:02.090 --> 03:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
makes sense to put these individuals in
 
03:50:04.130 --> 03:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
an unclassified or as a private sector
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
salaried type position for the
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
accessibility we learned a lot about
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
this through covid-19 and make this ask
 
03:50:13.370 --> 03:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out that the deputy
 
03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
Warden classified position is a group
 
03:50:17.210 --> 03:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
two law enforcement position and this
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
ask is to keep them unclassified but a
 
03:50:22.190 --> 03:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
group two unclassified because they work
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis Behind the Walls of the
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
prison and contact with prisoners
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
what I see in the budget is that the
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
number of unclassified positions is the
 
03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:32.570 align:start position:0%
number of unclassified positions is the
same

03:50:32.570 --> 03:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:50:36.530 --> 03:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
is is at 19 unchanging but these are
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
adding some is yeah so this goes through
 
03:50:40.729 --> 03:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
that great question this goes through
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
the hb2 process and the foot footnote
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
includes that if it is afforded that
 
03:50:48.410 --> 03:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity those three classify that
 
03:50:51.290 --> 03:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
exist in that number now would switch in
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
the budget to three unclassified so
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're not gaining we're switching as
 
03:50:59.210 --> 03:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.370 --> 03:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
so that discussion continues through
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
page nine and on the top of page 10
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
talking about those goals uh in the
 
03:51:11.090 --> 03:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
middle of page 10 there are there are
 
03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
three position numbers the way uh the
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
agency needs to navigate
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
um putting people properly in a group
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
two Correctional line Personnel position
 
03:51:22.490 --> 03:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
is to bring it to the legislature
 
03:51:25.490 --> 03:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
because we had a sunset Clause occur and
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
we've added licensed nursing assistance
 
03:51:30.170 --> 03:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
to the Direct Care model in our prisons
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
who work every single day one-on-one
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
providing health care and security with
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
people incarcerated and what often looks
 
03:51:39.769 --> 03:51:39.779 align:start position:0%
like an obscure title the administrative
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
obscure psychiatric unit is in a secure
 
03:51:46.210 --> 03:51:46.220 align:start position:0%
unit every day interacting with
 
03:51:48.050 --> 03:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals who are
 
03:51:51.290 --> 03:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
mentally ill so these three meet the
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
statutary statutory definition I'm
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
asking to see those transitions so they
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
get equal benefit as people working
 
03:52:01.330 --> 03:52:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a one-time charge
 
03:52:07.010 --> 03:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:52:08.929 --> 03:52:08.939 align:start position:0%
um or in addition to the unfunded
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
liability when we switch somebody from
 
03:52:13.130 --> 03:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
group one to group two we did the
 
03:52:16.269 --> 03:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
analysis the last go around and happy to
 
03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
dive into that in this instance hold on
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'll see if Lisa knows that right off
 
03:52:26.769 --> 03:52:26.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.450 --> 03:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
with me is Lisa Stone she's our deputy
 
03:52:31.250 --> 03:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
director of administrative Services you
 
03:52:35.469 --> 03:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability between the switch of
 
03:52:40.370 --> 03:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
group one to group two right do we have
 
03:52:41.929 --> 03:52:41.939 align:start position:0%
to put in when we when we change
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from group one to group two
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
group two normally would have a lot more
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
um saved for them at a certain point in
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
their career right so so do we need to
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.410 --> 03:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
oh I see they're only group two going
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
forward they're not group two for their
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
total career I see thank you very much
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know I knew the answer to that but I
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
didn't understand your question I'm glad
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
we had that dialogue yes it's a split
 
03:53:11.809 --> 03:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
benefit I myself when I started in 2003
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
was a group two employee and I switched
 
03:53:16.610 --> 03:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
to a group one employee in 2009 uh five
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm a split benefit moving forward
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome these three positions are
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
um on the bottom of page 10 uh which
 
03:53:29.809 --> 03:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
would be the what I was trying to do was
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
streamline law
 
03:53:34.490 --> 03:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh in the existing section this does not
 
03:53:37.130 --> 03:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
do away with these positions because the
 
03:53:39.290 --> 03:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
positions stricken is a position
 
03:53:41.450 --> 03:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
referenced above in that section of
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
Statute I was merely trying to clean up
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
a sentence because it lists the
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
commissioner assistant commissioner the
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards director the
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
director of personnel of an information
 
03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
the director of rehabilitative services
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
and the division directors we have other
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
division directors so this is just a
 
03:54:00.290 --> 03:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
cleanup and the other two directors
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
specifically reference were supposed to
 
03:54:03.769 --> 03:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
be stricken so it was a clean sentence
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner assistant commissioner
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
and division directors so on and so
 
03:54:08.279 --> 03:54:09.190 align:start position:0%
and division directors so on and so
forth

03:54:09.190 --> 03:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
forth
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
on page 11 we get into the depth of what
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
I know I have spoken to a lot of
 
03:54:22.729 --> 03:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
individuals about but the governor's
 
03:54:24.969 --> 03:54:24.979 align:start position:0%
included an hb2
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
establishment of a non-lapsing fund to
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
begin the purpose of design and
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
construction of a New Hampshire state
 
03:54:32.990 --> 03:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
prison for men
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of work the last few
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
years looking at our ass to the capital
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee and saying how
 
03:54:41.090 --> 03:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
do we as a state and how do we as a
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
department move the needle forward given
 
03:54:46.490 --> 03:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
the cost and price tag of a new New
 
03:54:48.170 --> 03:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
the oldest infrastructure being from
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
1878. and in doing so and talking to the
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
treasury and understanding what is
 
03:54:58.010 --> 03:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
allocated each year there wasn't a path
 
03:54:59.809 --> 03:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
forward we understood what the bonding
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
rate was but how do we Bond over 300
 
03:55:04.570 --> 03:55:04.580 align:start position:0%
million or 500 million dollars
 
03:55:08.450 --> 03:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
and the discussions I've had resulted in
 
03:55:10.250 --> 03:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
this outcome which I think is a great
 
03:55:11.929 --> 03:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
place to begin it provides a path
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
forward it says we're we understand and
 
03:55:16.969 --> 03:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
I would say we understand as a
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
department that investing in a new
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
prison might not be everybody's top
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
priority are there other areas to invest
 
03:55:24.650 --> 03:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
in but I can tell you today that that
 
03:55:26.450 --> 03:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is failing that
 
03:55:27.769 --> 03:55:27.779 align:start position:0%
environment is part of our retention
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
problem it is not the place in which we
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
are rehabilitating people in a long-term
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
situation we have more tarps and hoses
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to buckets than we should at that
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular location and this starts
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
moving that forward in an assertive way
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I I would ask that members of this
 
03:55:47.450 --> 03:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee and the full legislature
 
03:55:48.889 --> 03:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
support the intent what the governor is
 
03:55:50.929 --> 03:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish in addition to if
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
you've not been to the New Hampshire
 
03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
state prison for men we offer that
 
03:55:56.330 --> 03:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to you we will show you that
 
03:55:57.889 --> 03:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
prison and then we will show you the New
 
03:55:59.150 --> 03:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correctional facility for
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
women and you will see the stark
 
03:56:03.290 --> 03:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
contrast between something that started
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
its infrastructure in 1878 and I'm not
 
03:56:07.250 --> 03:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
talking about an old beautiful Farmhouse
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
talking about a correctional institution
 
03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
and a facility built and moved into in
 
03:56:14.030 --> 03:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
2018. and you will see the difference
 
03:56:15.889 --> 03:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
between a rehabilitative environment
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
designed with efficiency and an
 
03:56:20.330 --> 03:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
environment built over time that is no
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
longer efficient for Staffing and is
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
slowly no longer appropriate for housing
 
03:56:27.130 --> 03:56:27.140 align:start position:0%
individuals in an incarcerated setting
 
03:56:29.929 --> 03:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
so that this is what is outlined on page
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
11. I'm certainly happy to answer any
 
03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:34.429 align:start position:0%
11. I'm certainly happy to answer any
questions

03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.010 --> 03:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative evil
 
03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
since they're most closely involved with
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
this have you in your discussions with
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
the public works and highways committee
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
have you told them what's happening in
 
03:56:49.490 --> 03:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
the operating budget and
 
03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about your needs and
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
I meet with them on Friday and I was
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
very happy to see members of that
 
03:56:59.210 --> 03:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
committee join a tour from last week so
 
03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'll continue that conversation in
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
depth on Friday and I know that I have
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
discussed it in the past talking about
 
03:57:07.849 --> 03:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
the investment and appropriate
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
investment made in the infrastructure as
 
03:57:11.929 --> 03:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
we move forward but oftentimes referred
 
03:57:14.090 --> 03:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
to it as a drop of a mortgage payment
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
that would be better spent
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
so this is almost like developing a
 
03:57:23.330 --> 03:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
capital reserve Fund in a way to build a
 
03:57:25.370 --> 03:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
new prison that's a great way to
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
describe it okay thank you you're
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
welcome so you talked about
 
03:57:33.290 --> 03:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
it you talked about efficiency
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that the Men's
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
prison in Berlin is the most efficient
 
03:57:41.570 --> 03:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
of the three in terms of
 
03:57:45.170 --> 03:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
um inmates per officer is that right I
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair representation and
 
03:57:48.530 --> 03:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
again another facility designed
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
understanding creating Staffing because
 
03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that was built in 2000.
 
03:57:55.610 --> 03:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
because and I've heard a criticism of
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
the women's prison in that it wasn't
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
designed as efficiently as Berlin is
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
that right or am I wrong I wouldn't say
 
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
that that's uh correct I would say they
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
both designed efficiently
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay so they do they have similar number
 
03:58:12.830 --> 03:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
of officers per inmates there were fewer
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
officers at the women's facility than
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
there is at the North Country Facility
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
by sheer volume we only have
 
03:58:19.849 --> 03:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
approximately just over 100 people
 
03:58:22.370 --> 03:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
incarcerated but there's only this
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
actually one person to 56 people at the
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
women's facility and at the North
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
Country facility in 2009 when we went
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
through a major budget reduction they
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
went from the same model to what's
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
called a roving model and so a group of
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
officers move unit to unit to unit to do
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
the count one would argue that that
 
03:58:45.410 --> 03:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
roving model creates more risk because
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's no direct Supervision in the
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
unit that facility was designed to be a
 
03:58:53.090 --> 03:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
direct supervision model so there are
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
criticisms of both directions but I
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
would say they're both efficiently
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
staffed at this point we've vetted the
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
roving model since 2010 it's worked and
 
03:59:05.210 --> 03:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
in some cases at the North Country
 
03:59:07.010 --> 03:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
facility we've gone back to the direct
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
supervision model because we have to
 
03:59:11.269 --> 03:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
modified therapeutic communities for
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and we have an
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
officer on first shift on those units
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
obviously to mitigate any Contraband
 
03:59:21.170 --> 03:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
issues around substance use you said one
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
officer for 56 that's the women's prison
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
is designed with two C3 units 56 total
 
03:59:30.769 --> 03:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
capacity in each unit and it's one
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
officer to 56.
 
03:59:35.689 --> 03:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
so the whole prison has two officers
 
03:59:35.699 --> 03:59:44.210 align:start position:0%
so the whole prison has two officers
nope

03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
three units there is one unit called the
 
03:59:49.010 --> 03:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
special management unit like houses are
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
maximum security closed custody step
 
03:59:53.330 --> 03:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
down or step up from General our
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
reception and diagnostic that's a
 
03:59:57.650 --> 03:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
two-person unit and then we have our C2
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
minimum security on that campus that's a
 
04:00:07.370 --> 04:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.929 --> 04:00:08.939 align:start position:0%
representative Campbell thank you Mr Jay
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
and I imagine that's three shifts you
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
got to multiply it by three you're gonna
 
04:00:14.210 --> 04:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
multiply it by three and then some
 
04:00:16.130 --> 04:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
because you need a relief Factor people
 
04:00:17.929 --> 04:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
do deserve a day off so it's usually
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
about a 4.25 Factor multiplication
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome right because
 
04:00:27.010 --> 04:00:27.020 align:start position:0%
there's weekends right yeah yeah okay
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right yes representative evil sorry
 
04:00:32.090 --> 04:00:32.100 align:start position:0%
I just have a couple more saying I was
 
04:00:34.130 --> 04:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
involved in the women's prison I have a
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
cup so do you have an idea of where you
 
04:00:40.610 --> 04:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
want to put the new Men's prison
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
I think before you sit on the property
 
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
there yeah we um we the state own the
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
parcel behind the women's prison and
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
we're having those conversation with
 
04:00:53.090 --> 04:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
Public Works about that acreage and
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
we've had preliminary conversations that
 
04:00:58.010 --> 04:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
it would fit there in acreage we have to
 
04:01:00.170 --> 04:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
do the same borings we did at the
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
women's prison and check the ledge
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
Factor but I think there is a definite
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put it behind it
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
what would you anticipate the design
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
month so both of these uh Appropriations
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
say designing and constructing the new
 
04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
prison what would you anticipate the
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
design portion of it would cost and if
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
this money was deposited would you
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
initiate that immediately
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
but representative John Hanson I can I
 
04:01:31.370 --> 04:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
can help uh answer that question so
 
04:01:32.929 --> 04:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
there is actually a percentage Factor
 
04:01:34.670 --> 04:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's used on the cost per square foot
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
of buildings of that size so if you ask
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
an architectural engineering firm what
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
it would cost to design something of
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
that size they're going to use let's say
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's a 300 million dollar facility it's
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to be about 25 million just in
 
04:01:47.530 --> 04:01:47.540 align:start position:0%
designing and on top of that as you know
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
25 million yeah oh sorry usually too
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
loud and well no we've got this oh so um
 
04:01:57.050 --> 04:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
yeah probably probably in the vicinity
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
of 25 million per 300 million dollar
 
04:02:01.610 --> 04:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
facility that's just a rough estimate
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
based on talking with architectural
 
04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
firms as I have building up to this but
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
keep in mind a lot of the work that
 
04:02:09.050 --> 04:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
we'll need to do on that end is to
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
develop those programs which are
 
04:02:12.410 --> 04:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
required by law the Llama decree and the
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
other things that um that you're
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with so that there would be a
 
04:02:17.450 --> 04:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
lot of extra work
 
04:02:19.130 --> 04:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
done to make sure we designed something
 
04:02:21.889 --> 04:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
that fits the state law fits our needs
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
so that that's some rough figures and if
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
the price goes up there would obviously
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
be a higher factor for the design of
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
that you know we're looking at as a
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned it the property
 
04:02:33.290 --> 04:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
up back
 
04:02:36.290 --> 04:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
that that whole concept that we use for
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
the women's prison could be replicated
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
up there we believe we're not sure until
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
we do as the commissioner pointed out
 
04:02:43.490 --> 04:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
borrowings and test bits and we've
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
already delineated the wetlands we did
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
that as part of the other project so
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
we're pretty comfortable with the 383
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
Acres that we have up there will be out
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
of sight out of mind abutting the
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
backside of the Concord property that's
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
the Calvary Cemetery a budding the other
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
side of the property which would be
 
04:03:00.290 --> 04:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
petticook Lake uh it's a new name for it
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
now the Concord Reservoir
 
04:03:04.490 --> 04:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and that's pretty much it up on that
 
04:03:04.500 --> 04:03:08.450 align:start position:0%
um and that's pretty much it up on that
Hill

04:03:08.450 --> 04:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
month that you have coming through the
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget is being used to look at
 
04:03:15.650 --> 04:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
the property is that what you just said
 
04:03:17.150 --> 04:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
we would have to take a look at the
 
04:03:18.769 --> 04:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
property in that way we're working with
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
Das and public works on the Deeds right
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
now to make sure that we're satisfied
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
we're it's more of a belt and suspenders
 
04:03:26.210 --> 04:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
approach where we've already shacked but
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
we want to double check to make sure
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a special easement for the
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
other source or utility lines that go
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
through from Unitil but we're pretty
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
well satisfied with the size and if we
 
04:03:36.650 --> 04:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
do the same thing we did and crush the
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
rocks that we did last time and not
 
04:03:41.450 --> 04:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
you have experience yeah a little
 
04:03:43.490 --> 04:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
experience there we brought very little
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
material into the site and we hope to do
 
04:03:46.849 --> 04:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
that again so we don't interfere with
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
the city of Concord is our good
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the north they have our
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
general facilities building there so
 
04:03:54.650 --> 04:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
that that's one of our plans
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I just
 
04:03:59.330 --> 04:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
so could you talk to us about the secure
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit and what's happening
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:04:02.520 --> 04:04:03.889 align:start position:0%
with that
world

04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
what's that world I would not hasten to
 
04:04:08.929 --> 04:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
talk about what Health and Human
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
Services is doing but I yes but I do
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a timeline that they put out in a
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
Public Presentation we'd happy to make
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
sure it is sent to this committee we are
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
obviously monitoring that timeline
 
04:04:23.210 --> 04:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
because some portion of our patient
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
population will move over there once
 
04:04:28.130 --> 04:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
it's built but we'll send that out it's
 
04:04:30.290 --> 04:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
been a topic of discussion as we've
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
moved through
 
04:04:34.130 --> 04:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you representative
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chairman when we're
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the new construction for a
 
04:04:40.610 --> 04:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
new building in the design obviously
 
04:04:42.530 --> 04:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
we're still sort of early in that
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
process but how do you determine what
 
04:04:48.410 --> 04:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
the capacity needs to be for the new
 
04:04:51.889 --> 04:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
prison is it what we have now times a
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
factor for what we might need 30 years
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
from now or what what goes into that
 
04:04:59.570 --> 04:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
process that's a great question we had
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
to do the same forecasting on the
 
04:05:04.090 --> 04:05:04.100 align:start position:0%
women's population looking at historical
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
population and I want to be clear it's
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
not just the numbers incarcerated it's
 
04:05:10.849 --> 04:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
the actual classification levels in the
 
04:05:12.769 --> 04:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
history of that as well because you have
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
to build those security classification
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
levels based on that at the time we did
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
the design for the women's prison I'm
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to give you this example the
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
trending and tracking was that the
 
04:05:25.969 --> 04:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
population was going to increase and
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the data told us so the
 
04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
facility was built with a maximum
 
04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
capacity of 224 with the understanding
 
04:05:34.729 --> 04:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
from the legislature that we created a
 
04:05:36.410 --> 04:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
space in case we needed to boost that
 
04:05:39.950 --> 04:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
number higher than 300. we've moved in
 
04:05:43.490 --> 04:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
and filled the capacity and the state's
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
trend of incarceration actually went
 
04:05:45.420 --> 04:05:46.849 align:start position:0%
trend of incarceration actually went
down

04:05:46.849 --> 04:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so some of the unanswered part of
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
your question is it will depend on what
 
04:05:52.729 --> 04:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
the state passes for sentencing laws
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
what the state does to intercept
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
incarceration and create diversion paths
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
and some of what we saw was the
 
04:06:01.969 --> 04:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
Statewide implementation post that
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
design of drug courts that reduce that
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
for women so to answer your question we
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
will look at the trended history of the
 
04:06:10.969 --> 04:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
incarcerated men's population by
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
classification type
 
04:06:14.689 --> 04:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you this agency's been
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
very proactive in reducing the use of C5
 
04:06:20.330 --> 04:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
or restrictive housing so
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
we would look at our history and see
 
04:06:23.809 --> 04:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
that it was up by the last two years we
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
would see it go down so we'd factor that
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
all in we'd look and forecast at what
 
04:06:30.650 --> 04:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
the fine legislature was passing for
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
laws and work with the design company on
 
04:06:37.130 --> 04:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
what that data is telling us
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Schultz
 
04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I didn't think
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
you noticed my hand thank you
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
um two things first the not really
 
04:06:47.450 --> 04:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
selfish but for my constituents as a
 
04:06:49.729 --> 04:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
Concord rep I would love to see the land
 
04:06:51.650 --> 04:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
at some point since you offered tours
 
04:06:53.689 --> 04:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
I'm actually not on the finance
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee but I would love to see if
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
other Concord reps if you're open to it
 
04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
how you know as this moves further down
 
04:07:02.210 --> 04:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
the line we'd love to to see that and
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
connected to that is a real question
 
04:07:06.540 --> 04:07:07.550 align:start position:0%
connected to that is a real question
um

04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
is there because I have toured at least
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
a section of the jail the psychiatric
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
secure unit before and
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I actually was impressed with the
 
04:07:21.769 --> 04:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
overall you know obviously I like most
 
04:07:24.050 --> 04:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
people support it moving
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
to a different facility for health
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
reasons and for family reasons but
 
04:07:31.250 --> 04:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's neither here nor there I thought
 
04:07:33.170 --> 04:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
the facilities looked good but I did not
 
04:07:35.689 --> 04:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
get a full tour so is there a thought
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
that any aspect of the existing
 
04:07:41.450 --> 04:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
facilities could be still in use
 
04:07:43.370 --> 04:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schultz thank you for
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
your comments the I was curious
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and it would look better
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
because in 2010 it had a capital
 
04:07:52.189 --> 04:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
investment made into it and we
 
04:07:53.689 --> 04:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
definitely were happy to show you the
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
reception and diagnostic area built
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
again the foundation of 1870. I'm sorry
 
04:07:58.080 --> 04:07:59.330 align:start position:0%
again the foundation of 1870. I'm sorry
I

04:07:59.330 --> 04:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is what you're getting
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
ready to say I apologize that's all
 
04:08:05.090 --> 04:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
right I I really meant for as you look
 
04:08:07.849 --> 04:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
to possibly building a new facility is
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
is there a belief or a possibility even
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um the current space can be looked
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
at and assessed to be either renovated
 
04:08:20.090 --> 04:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
or in some fashion used
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's a fair question I will tell
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
you that if we attempt to use any
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the existing campus and a new
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
campus that's not Staffing efficient but
 
04:08:31.849 --> 04:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
designing a facility that is not campus
 
04:08:34.969 --> 04:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
style will be Staffing efficient so
 
04:08:36.889 --> 04:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
right now at the Men's prison you walk
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
in you have to go over to this building
 
04:08:40.490 --> 04:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
to that building to this building
 
04:08:42.130 --> 04:08:42.140 align:start position:0%
because it was built over time
 
04:08:44.450 --> 04:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
Corrections facilities are not built in
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
a campus style because it's not Staffing
 
04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
efficient I think everyone has asked
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
that reasonable question which is what
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
would you do with that infrastructure
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
and some of the carefulness in my
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
responses we clearly don't want
 
04:08:58.849 --> 04:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
necessarily a public function occurring
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
on a correctional campus but also
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
mindful that even that building recently
 
04:09:06.530 --> 04:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
had its roof blown off so as much as
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
we've had portions of it done at earlier
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
years the infrastructure we keep it
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
clean we keep it painted but I'm not
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
sure it would end up with a staffing
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
efficiency but we'll be mindful of what
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
we can do with State research sources
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and yes your previous one
 
04:09:26.410 --> 04:09:26.420 align:start position:0%
was a question happy to give you a tour
 
04:09:30.410 --> 04:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
is there extra land in Berlin
 
04:09:34.330 --> 04:09:34.340 align:start position:0%
so the land in Berlin we wouldn't
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
attempt to think to build a new prison
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
up there because of the recruitment
 
04:09:40.490 --> 04:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
issues for the diverse Diversified
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
professionals we need we are also
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
recruiting um for positions up there but
 
04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
the largest mass with the women's prison
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
down here the warehouse our transitional
 
04:09:53.929 --> 04:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
housing units again it creates an
 
04:09:55.729 --> 04:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
organizational efficiency to continue to
 
04:09:56.929 --> 04:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
look at Concord
 
04:10:01.370 --> 04:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:10:06.910 --> 04:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
on page 12 you'll see an appropriation
 
04:10:10.250 --> 04:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
again funding the computer information
 
04:10:13.849 --> 04:10:13.859 align:start position:0%
the literal physical computers we use an
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that replacement
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
and then for the footnote that talks
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
about Corrections Officers salaries I
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that's to make sure
 
04:10:26.450 --> 04:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
that part-time Corrections Officers and
 
04:10:29.450 --> 04:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
the corrections officer majors are paid
 
04:10:31.370 --> 04:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
commensurable to the negotiated
 
04:10:33.889 --> 04:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
contracts there has been some debate
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
about that and we want to make sure we
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
solidify that if we recruit a part-time
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
corrections officer they receive equal
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
pay for equal work the same for our
 
04:10:44.450 --> 04:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
corrections officer majors
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of hb2 is an ask from the
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
Department and ask for the house finance
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
to consider an inclusion in hb2 I sent
 
04:10:55.610 --> 04:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
this language post the agency
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
presentation if you'll recall on that
 
04:11:00.530 --> 04:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
presentation and and I know that others
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
who aren't able to be present I'm sure
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
I've seen that on page 13 that the
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
department has remitted reallocation
 
04:11:10.610 --> 04:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
packets to the division of personnel we
 
04:11:12.650 --> 04:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't know what the analysis will result
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
in as far as salary adjustments this
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
language allows for the state to respond
 
04:11:19.969 --> 04:11:19.979 align:start position:0%
to those salary adjustments whatever
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that number may be again I'll just
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
remind that corrections officer trainees
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and Corrections Officers are the lowest
 
04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
paid state law enforcement because the
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
agency didn't keep up with adjusting
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
their job descriptions and we are trying
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
to rectify that situation and ask for
 
04:11:37.849 --> 04:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
this language to be included I will also
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that the state troopers had a
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
similar footnote in the hb4 that came
 
04:11:46.250 --> 04:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
out in FY 19 and 20 so there is some
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
history of trying to rectify these
 
04:11:51.130 --> 04:11:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
no I I don't know but I do I do know
 
04:12:05.450 --> 04:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
that the state is in negotiations and
 
04:12:07.010 --> 04:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
was also in negotiations during that
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
time so I would defer to the governor's
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
office to help assist in that question
 
04:12:15.290 --> 04:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
and I'd be curious
 
04:12:17.570 --> 04:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say you came up
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
with this later
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
well this is definitely a movement in
 
04:12:23.040 --> 04:12:24.229 align:start position:0%
well this is definitely a movement in
progress

04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
progress
 
04:12:27.410 --> 04:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and carefulness we did just submit
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
all of those packets uh post the
 
04:12:32.809 --> 04:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
governor finalizing his budget
 
04:12:32.819 --> 04:12:34.490 align:start position:0%
governor finalizing his budget
yeah

04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:12:34.500 --> 04:12:35.210 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of moving parts so I never a speak
 
04:12:41.150 --> 04:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
for the governor's office and be here I
 
04:12:42.429 --> 04:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
am today
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney
 
04:12:48.170 --> 04:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so on on page 13. so in an
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
Ideal World I think minimizing overtime
 
04:12:54.170 --> 04:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
as much as possible by
 
04:12:56.330 --> 04:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
increasing either the salaries or
 
04:12:58.969 --> 04:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
whatever we need to increase Recruitment
 
04:13:01.729 --> 04:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
and Retention the
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
I guess proposed in another divisions
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the proposed 10 percent
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
across the board hike is that enough for
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers in order to meet
 
04:13:15.769 --> 04:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
the retaining and recruitment goals or
 
04:13:17.210 --> 04:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
or where what are we looking at what
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
what would we need to do to be able to
 
04:13:21.889 --> 04:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
minimize over time as much as possible
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
and fully staff represents me thank you
 
04:13:26.530 --> 04:13:26.540 align:start position:0%
for that question so the 10
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
moves everybody 10 so the Gap that
 
04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
exists today is now the same Gap at 10
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
higher what the intent of the footnote
 
04:13:38.689 --> 04:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of hb12 uh page 12 hb2
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
page 12 lots of numbers and on how you
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
all do it I only have one budget
 
04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
um is to say that we're trying to move
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
that base salary as allowed under
 
04:13:50.570 --> 04:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
Personnel rule outside of bargaining so
 
04:13:53.210 --> 04:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
that 10 percent will reflect off of that
 
04:13:55.370 --> 04:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
base salary to commemorate a
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
competitiveness and to fix that chart
 
04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
that I shared so I think that makes a a
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
certain significant Mark recognizing
 
04:14:06.410 --> 04:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
that Corrections law enforcement is
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
different than it was several decades
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
ago and the 10 for All State agencies is
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
a value in keeping up with the community
 
04:14:16.250 --> 04:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
I myself drove through
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't do this often a McDonald's to to
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
get something and Subs they offered 17
 
04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
to 18 an hour when a corrections officer
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
at the time was making twenty dollars an
 
04:14:28.490 --> 04:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
hour as a trainee we're not just
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
competing with law enforcement we're
 
04:14:31.849 --> 04:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
competing with the community so we need
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
to shore up our state-based policies and
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead thank you so I just have a
 
04:14:44.030 --> 04:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
request for more information then can we
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
get the numbers of what the percent
 
04:14:47.570 --> 04:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
increase would be or the hourly rate
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
increase would be if we were to include
 
04:14:53.150 --> 04:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
the additional appropriation and then
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
the 10 across the board hike what that
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
would make the the pay for Corrections
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
Officers yeah representative Sweeney I'm
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
not sure if I can get you that answer
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
because the division of personnel is
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
literally going through those packets
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
and they make that determination but
 
04:15:09.290 --> 04:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'll reach out and ask how close they
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
are to reviewing those appreciate it
 
04:15:12.290 --> 04:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:15:12.300 --> 04:15:13.490 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
Campbell

04:15:13.490 --> 04:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
Campbell
 
04:15:15.290 --> 04:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I know when I took the tour recently
 
04:15:19.490 --> 04:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
that I believe it was a vacancy rate for
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
correctional officers of about 50 51 51
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
so obviously the overtime is killing you
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
because the are you what is the overtime
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
do they get double pay two and a half or
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
what what is the what is the rate they
 
04:15:37.849 --> 04:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
get for overtime so there are two
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
different contracts that would govern um
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
they're multiple I have five contracts
 
04:15:43.610 --> 04:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
because I have five different employees
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
the teamsters after 16 hours get double
 
04:15:49.250 --> 04:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
the first 16 is time and a half after 16
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
is double there is some negotiation to
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
change that the sergeant Teamsters are
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
officers and corporals the sergeants and
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
above make time and a half
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
over 16 no the time and a half they
 
04:16:05.330 --> 04:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't have the double time provision
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe what's before the
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
legislature should include a double time
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
provision for all overtime but I don't
 
04:16:13.969 --> 04:16:13.979 align:start position:0%
want to speak for employee relations
 
04:16:16.130 --> 04:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
um I want to share that we use our
 
04:16:18.290 --> 04:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
Correctional line Personnel voluntarily
 
04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
so some of their overtime is time and a
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
half some of their time is at straight
 
04:16:24.170 --> 04:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
time and then our probation and parole
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
officers are at time and a half and they
 
04:16:28.370 --> 04:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
also fill in the void so it's all hands
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
on deck at Corrections with every member
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
volunteering and or working a overtime
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
post so follow up so is it safe to say
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
that if you were able to fill the
 
04:16:40.010 --> 04:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
positions full time we would actually
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
save money because the overtime costs
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
more absolutely to make up those hours
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
100 okay yeah
 
04:16:50.210 --> 04:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
we want to reduce the overtime well but
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of it is stress right I
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's because you in some sense
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
you save on benefits because if you have
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
one person working overtime you don't
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
have two people collecting benefits but
 
04:17:03.610 --> 04:17:03.620 align:start position:0%
anyways of the
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
975 six employees how many do you
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
04:17:13.330 --> 04:17:13.340 align:start position:0%
I believe our fill rate's around 771 770
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
approximately 770 I'll get a firm number
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're about 200 Short yes wow
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
um an interesting comment on our
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
Correctional line Personnel we're
 
04:17:24.110 --> 04:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
actually seeing a positive trend in
 
04:17:24.120 --> 04:17:25.250 align:start position:0%
actually seeing a positive trend in
hiring

04:17:25.250 --> 04:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that's interesting I haven't seen
 
04:17:28.849 --> 04:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
that in a while but our law enforcement
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
ranks is the area of significant deficit
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
are you worse off in Concord or Berlin
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
Concord Berlin is actually uh if not
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
static slightly higher than they were
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
last year at this time still have needs
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
but they have not seen the hits in
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
Concord I see so you have openings
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere right openings everywhere we
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
gladly take your application and we uh
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity employers sir
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah on page 13 I get a high level
 
04:18:00.530 --> 04:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
overview of the budget book showing you
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
line by line comparatives by specific
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
class lines of significance I'm happy to
 
04:18:07.729 --> 04:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
dive into any specific page you have a
 
04:18:09.650 --> 04:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
question on the budget or other
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions relevant to the Department's
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
operational needs
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
so I remember when we were here last
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
time we talked about
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
rules that prevented you from
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
recognizing superiors
 
04:18:24.779 --> 04:18:25.790 align:start position:0%
recognizing superiors
um

04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
performance by employees or parties or
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know things like that did we ever
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
get any language to change that yes I
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
did send a language over to Mr Hoffman
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
I did email that to all the members of
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
The Division I can make photocopies
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
right now if you'd like it yeah why
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:01.250 --> 04:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah now I guess we've we've actually
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
gone through all of the House Bill 2
 
04:19:05.570 --> 04:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
items right because that was part of
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
this presentation was there any should
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
we just look at the list just to make
 
04:19:10.380 --> 04:19:12.590 align:start position:0%
we just look at the list just to make
sure

04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't we kind of officially go
 
04:19:17.929 --> 04:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
through the list and make sure there's
 
04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.739 --> 04:19:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.239 --> 04:19:44.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:19:47.689 --> 04:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
I think they have hb2 so that's page
 
04:19:47.699 --> 04:20:06.710 align:start position:0%
I think they have hb2 so that's page
four

04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.689 --> 04:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
so this is something you always have is
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
that right
 
04:20:10.020 --> 04:20:11.210 align:start position:0%
that right
the

04:20:11.210 --> 04:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
had that transfer Authority for uh at
 
04:20:16.250 --> 04:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
least too much Cycles now yeah
 
04:20:18.889 --> 04:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
and including the medical transfer
 
04:20:21.050 --> 04:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
Authority new this year would be our ask
 
04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
around coming back for utilities and
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
then again new is the three uh
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions that would
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
replace classified positions so it's an
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
equal transfer
 
04:20:36.290 --> 04:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
and then the new ask is the three group
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
two positions and then again the cleanup
 
04:20:41.570 --> 04:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
language that was not as successful as I
 
04:20:46.010 --> 04:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
so any problem with 13
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.450 --> 04:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay section 14. this is the
 
04:20:59.460 --> 04:21:01.070 align:start position:0%
okay section 14. this is the
unclassified

04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
so this is currently classified but not
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
becoming unclassified right
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
and going through the joint committee on
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
employee classifications under the
 
04:21:09.960 --> 04:21:14.450 align:start position:0%
employee classifications under the
legislature

04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right yeah okay third 14.
 
04:21:18.600 --> 04:21:21.650 align:start position:0%
all right yeah okay third 14.
15.

04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
oh this is the group two
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
for those three employees position types
 
04:21:29.150 --> 04:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
and this is because they're they're
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
constantly with inmates yes they meet
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
the statutory definition of Correctional
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
line Personnel under the retirement law
 
04:21:39.469 --> 04:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:21:42.290 --> 04:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:21:42.300 --> 04:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
16.

04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
the only thing there would be to ask
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
that you strike director of personnel
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
and information and director of
 
04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services that was the
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
goal just to streamline the sentence
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
because division directors would
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
Encompass those positions it does not
 
04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
eliminate those positions
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just technical it's just
 
04:22:07.729 --> 04:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
technical okay and the same in the
 
04:22:12.889 --> 04:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
oh yep but it's two paragraphs Roman
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
numeral one and two would need the same
 
04:22:23.389 --> 04:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
all right 17 okay 16 17.
 
04:22:32.210 --> 04:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
well there's this new one right
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.080 --> 04:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
oops

04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
oops
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay well this one obviously we're gonna
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
have to talk about later
 
04:22:47.760 --> 04:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
have to talk about later
yeah

04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:22:54.349 --> 04:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
right so 68 and 69 those are the 10 and
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
40 million I think
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
68 69.70
 
04:23:04.610 --> 04:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:04.620 --> 04:23:07.010 align:start position:0%
 
.

04:23:07.010 --> 04:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
so we can't do those until we have
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
our whole numbers and 73 is the
 
04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.260 --> 04:23:22.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:23:24.300 --> 04:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
so that
um

04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.689 --> 04:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.699 --> 04:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:44.150 --> 04:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then uh 193 is the equity in
 
04:23:46.370 --> 04:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
part-time officers getting the same pay
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
as Corrections Officers as well as
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections major being paid
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
commensurate with other leadership uh
 
04:23:55.370 --> 04:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
security leadership
 
04:24:00.769 --> 04:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay so that one 193. yeah
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
sorry to be slow here but did you say 73
 
04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
and 74 were okay yes
 
04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.260 --> 04:24:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:24:20.330 --> 04:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.720 --> 04:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
.

04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.040 --> 04:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
yeah this one seems reasonable
 
04:24:39.410 --> 04:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
to help you
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
get some more power time yes people okay
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.479 --> 04:25:10.610 align:start position:0%
 
yeah right

04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
04:25:12.650 --> 04:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay was that it or was there more right
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then my additional and then request
 
04:25:16.130 --> 04:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
obviously for you to discuss and
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
consider on the bottom there's a bit of
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
a line at The copier Janet's going to
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
bring that in as soon as you can
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.010 --> 04:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
no such thing go ahead
 
04:25:34.130 --> 04:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
just overall I'm I'm sure you've
 
04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:36.050 align:start position:0%
just overall I'm I'm sure you've
considered

04:25:36.050 --> 04:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:25:37.330 --> 04:25:37.340 align:start position:0%
um other
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities for example I
 
04:25:43.610 --> 04:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
know the Merrimack County Jail is great
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
and it's fairly new and I don't know
 
04:25:48.889 --> 04:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
what their overtime situation is but if
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
they had the resources
 
04:25:53.389 --> 04:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
is that an arrangement
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
that would be fiscally
 
04:25:58.729 --> 04:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
a good one I mean I realize that's not
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
efficient I'm hearing your efficiency
 
04:26:01.080 --> 04:26:02.090 align:start position:0%
efficient I'm hearing your efficiency
argument

04:26:02.090 --> 04:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
argument
 
04:26:04.729 --> 04:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
do you mean as a fiscal plant or do you
 
04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
mean as a potential temporary place if
 
04:26:11.769 --> 04:26:11.779 align:start position:0%
you don't if because 50 capacity of
 
04:26:15.050 --> 04:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers is crazy in my
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
opinion and it's probably hard for you
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
too probably harder for you
 
04:26:18.840 --> 04:26:19.670 align:start position:0%
too probably harder for you
um

04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know the capacity right now of
 
04:26:24.410 --> 04:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
say any of our other correctional
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
facilities like Merrimack County jail
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
um it isn't that much further
 
04:26:30.060 --> 04:26:31.729 align:start position:0%
um it isn't that much further
uh

04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
is that something that's ever been
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
considered to look at as a cost-saving
 
04:26:37.849 --> 04:26:37.859 align:start position:0%
measure if they had the capacity because
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
I'd imagine it would be cheaper
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
in the short term to possibly pay them a
 
04:26:48.889 --> 04:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
portion of what you would pay overall if
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have the Personnel capacity
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we house a project question makes
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
sense if you're talking about housing
 
04:26:57.530 --> 04:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated at Merrimack
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
County Jail we have approximately uh one
 
04:27:03.170 --> 04:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
thousand slightly it's approximately 1
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
200 men incarcerated the New Hampshire
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
state prison for men that doesn't fit
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
the capacity of the county jail county
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
jails are designed for short-term stays
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
one year or less so even their health
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
care infrastructure wouldn't meet our
 
04:27:20.110 --> 04:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
needs we actually talked um we talked
 
04:27:24.649 --> 04:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
off offline during the pandemic when
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
their housing sense is slow about
 
04:27:28.929 --> 04:27:28.939 align:start position:0%
whether we would contract to house their
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
residents and have their employees come
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
in and manage their residence but we
 
04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
have not been there's no physical jail
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
at this point that is large enough to do
 
04:27:39.649 --> 04:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
what you're considering but we have
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
talked about it and we've even we've
 
04:27:44.809 --> 04:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
even talked about can we recruit County
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
jail officers to come work for us some
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
of the disconnect just on the Staffing
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
side is they don't go through the same
 
04:27:52.969 --> 04:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
Corrections Academy or have the same
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
minimum quals but that's not necessarily
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
a barrier and some of it is simply I
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
don't believe the county jail
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
superintendents want me to recruit their
 
04:27:59.939 --> 04:28:01.849 align:start position:0%
superintendents want me to recruit their
employees

04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and they were at one point had a very
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
significant vacancy rate and they I was
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
quite jealous when I read in the paper
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
the Belknap County Superintendent saying
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
you need five officers to Sure up his
 
04:28:16.729 --> 04:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
Staffing I was very jealous I need like
 
04:28:16.739 --> 04:28:19.849 align:start position:0%
Staffing I was very jealous I need like
205.

04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a reasonable question
 
04:28:27.290 --> 04:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
so Mike before we get to this new one
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
why don't we on page 12 of their today's
 
04:28:34.729 --> 04:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
handout at the bottom uh representative
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
evil pointed out that this
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
um this is new language that they're
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
requesting what this was was
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the ability to go to the Department
 
04:28:47.649 --> 04:28:47.659 align:start position:0%
of administrative services and
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
re-classify some of the lower level
 
04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
corrections officer positions so that
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're paid a little better than fish
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
and game and some of these other
 
04:28:58.680 --> 04:28:59.290 align:start position:0%
and game and some of these other
um

04:28:59.290 --> 04:28:59.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:02.570 --> 04:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
officers right or at least commensurate
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
with other uh
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
Junior officers right so
 
04:29:10.130 --> 04:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
um what about what does the committee
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.239 --> 04:29:20.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:32.570 --> 04:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
so remember we talked about this last
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
time we had we got a we had a chart of
 
04:29:40.370 --> 04:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
all uh uniformed officers essentially
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it and and the the corrections
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
trainees were like the lowest paid
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
similar to fish and game this this thing
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's similar to fish and game
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
trainees and so this is the thing to fix
 
04:29:53.939 --> 04:29:54.950 align:start position:0%
trainees and so this is the thing to fix
that

04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:54.960 --> 04:29:57.290 align:start position:0%
that
because

04:29:57.290 --> 04:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:30:00.410 --> 04:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
at least in my mind those trainees have
 
04:30:04.729 --> 04:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
a have a more stressful job than uh
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
other kinds of
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
officers right so yeah I would agree
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
 
04:30:10.859 --> 04:30:12.469 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
yeah okay

04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
so Mike can we figure out a place in
 
04:30:16.969 --> 04:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
well first of all this language doesn't
 
04:30:21.290 --> 04:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
yet have an RSA uh or maybe this is
 
04:30:23.689 --> 04:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
chapter wide I don't know but figure out
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
where it goes I guess yes that would be
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
chapter well we we just add a new
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
section at the back and then when all of
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
us gets it they'll just use the next
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
number okay and it's modeled after
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
um language that was done for the state
 
04:30:43.010 --> 04:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
troopers a few years ago great okay so
 
04:30:46.250 --> 04:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
we're okay with this one yeah okay
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
all right now to this one
 
04:30:52.370 --> 04:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
the one that was just tainted out
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
why don't you explain what you've done
 
04:31:11.450 --> 04:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
certainly so in talking uh when we
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
talked last it's about how do we
 
04:31:16.090 --> 04:31:16.100 align:start position:0%
um how do we continue to
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
recognize employees for Superior Service
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
or in this instance I would say the
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
number of hours that corrections
 
04:31:25.729 --> 04:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
employees are engaging in overtime is a
 
04:31:28.610 --> 04:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
superior service to the state so using
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
language that exists and will sunset
 
04:31:36.050 --> 04:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
June 30 in 2023 through the previous
 
04:31:38.570 --> 04:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
passage of some legislation I
 
04:31:40.250 --> 04:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
recommended including in our specific
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
section a statute I have a division of
 
04:31:45.290 --> 04:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
personnel and information they insert
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
new language to specifically Target one
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
week one week National correctionals
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
professional week and provide us the
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to under the value of under
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
the value of 25
 
04:32:01.969 --> 04:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
incentive performance incentives during
 
04:32:03.250 --> 04:32:03.260 align:start position:0%
that week
 
04:32:06.769 --> 04:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
and I add some explicit language on the
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
following page just trying to be mindful
 
04:32:11.290 --> 04:32:11.300 align:start position:0%
of existing statutes and existing laws
 
04:32:13.729 --> 04:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
that it would be for that exclusive
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
purpose only as a testing the waters of
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
the State trying to be a little more
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
nimble like the private sector but
 
04:32:26.929 --> 04:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then noting that these types of
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
incentives are not collectively
 
04:32:33.050 --> 04:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
bargained so they're not they're
 
04:32:35.809 --> 04:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
something you earn they're a credit to
 
04:32:37.250 --> 04:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
the work that you're doing on behalf of
 
04:32:42.110 --> 04:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
I I'd looked at the average of 750
 
04:32:56.210 --> 04:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
employees and spending thirty dollars on
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
each of them during that week that came
 
04:32:58.969 --> 04:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
to a
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
sum total of twenty two thousand five
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that was the that was me being
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.400 --> 04:33:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that that was recognition yes what is
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
but you're talking here about there's
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
some larger Statewide program that's
 
04:33:26.631 --> 04:33:26.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.810 --> 04:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
was passed with a sunset Clause so
 
04:33:32.209 --> 04:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
through the state division of personnel
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
they have created uh more specifically
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
to Target the issues of Staffing
 
04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention those type of
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
incentives I'm asking for something
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
distinctly different but under the same
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
philosophy to Target recognition
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
and recognition as a part of retention I
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
think many of us know that but that
 
04:33:55.369 --> 04:33:55.379 align:start position:0%
foundational elements started the
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
process of the things that you've likely
 
04:33:59.449 --> 04:33:59.459 align:start position:0%
heard in the paper where if you're a new
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
corrections officer and you come to the
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there's a
 
04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
currently right now a ten thousand
 
04:34:06.289 --> 04:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
dollar incentive payment the same is
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
true for state troopers trying to draw
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
people to law enforcement that's not
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm recommending moving forward
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
when that sunsets I'm recommending
 
04:34:15.410 --> 04:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
something specific
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
during that National week that records
 
04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
recognizes Corrections across the
 
04:34:22.609 --> 04:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
country that a line item be created so
 
04:34:27.769 --> 04:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
we can recognize and do Awards and gift
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
cards and simple gestures that go a long
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
way to our state employees working in
 
04:34:33.600 --> 04:34:34.849 align:start position:0%
way to our state employees working in
Corrections

04:34:34.849 --> 04:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
04:34:34.859 --> 04:34:36.709 align:start position:0%
Corrections
okay

04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:36.719 --> 04:34:37.490 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:37.500 --> 04:34:38.029 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
well I don't see any problem with that
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
um so will the
 
04:34:45.131 --> 04:34:45.141 align:start position:0%
will the
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Mike do we know if s if the Das is doing
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
something to replace SB 226
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so I just I think so it
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
wasn't a success it ends at the end of
 
04:35:02.631 --> 04:35:02.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.449 --> 04:35:05.459 align:start position:0%
did you use it at all or was it we uh
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
used it with regard to trying to shore
 
04:35:09.650 --> 04:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
up our staff during the tough toughest
 
04:35:11.689 --> 04:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
time so we had a two thousand dollar
 
04:35:14.510 --> 04:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
retention incentive and then we have
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
that 10 000 we're trying to draw people
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
in as corrections officer the largest
 
04:35:22.730 --> 04:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
Statewide initiative was an initiative
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
to award state employees who make a
 
04:35:29.449 --> 04:35:29.459 align:start position:0%
referral for a new state employee that
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
period of supportive retention I would
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
call it and they each get a thousand
 
04:35:35.689 --> 04:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
dollars and I think for a part-time they
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
each got a 500 so all of those things go
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
away on June 30
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
um and again I was looking to say what's
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable for an organization and this
 
04:35:48.170 --> 04:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
was reasonable I think shuring up
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
people's wages is a way to rectify how
 
04:35:53.929 --> 04:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
we've used uh the outcome of Senate Bill
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
226 but this is uh I think different
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
from that perspective and similar in the
 
04:36:01.609 --> 04:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
intent which is to recognize employees
 
04:36:03.890 --> 04:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
and focus on retention
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a much more minor type
 
04:36:08.051 --> 04:36:08.061 align:start position:0%
thing right
 
04:36:12.051 --> 04:36:12.061 align:start position:0%
any comments on this section
 
04:36:15.289 --> 04:36:15.299 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schultz I'm just
 
04:36:18.051 --> 04:36:18.061 align:start position:0%
obsessed with employee happiness it's a
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
hobby of mine actually in a research
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
topic I haven't making professional
 
04:36:22.199 --> 04:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
topic I haven't making professional
sense

04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:36:23.520 --> 04:36:24.470 align:start position:0%
sense
um

04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
I think it could be interesting
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
to pull workers to see what incentives
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
during this time I Do by the way think
 
04:36:34.369 --> 04:36:34.379 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
referral fee and bonus thing is
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
definitely could be helpful but beyond
 
04:36:43.010 --> 04:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
that I think it the things that
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
one might assume would be the best thing
 
04:36:48.051 --> 04:36:48.061 align:start position:0%
that folks would want or that that would
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
make them that they would be most happy
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
with as even a prize for something isn't
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
always what we would assume it to be so
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's more of an editorial comment just
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
to say maybe that's an interesting thing
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:37:05.570 --> 04:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
stewards of your union or something to
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
poll members I don't know just putting
 
04:37:09.529 --> 04:37:09.539 align:start position:0%
that out there
 
04:37:14.029 --> 04:37:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
if we do this there's no chance we're
 
04:37:17.689 --> 04:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble with any Union
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
contract by compensating somebody in a
 
04:37:22.970 --> 04:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
way that the contract doesn't specify so
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the highlight of I don't
 
04:37:26.689 --> 04:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
know I think it's great insert new
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see that I included a section e
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
that balances exactly that
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
through you have to go through fiscal
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee before you is that what this
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
says I did replicate what has been the
 
04:37:51.539 --> 04:37:52.551 align:start position:0%
says I did replicate what has been the
process

04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
I don't mind not going through fiscal
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
but I also uh I don't mind not having to
 
04:37:58.970 --> 04:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
go through fiscal given that I only
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
asked for 22 500 and I
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
um if it was a larger amount I think if
 
04:38:06.529 --> 04:38:06.539 align:start position:0%
the is it a hundred thousand dollars or
 
04:38:12.650 --> 04:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe we'll take out that fiscal
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee section
 
04:38:17.400 --> 04:38:20.929 align:start position:0%
committee section
um

04:38:20.929 --> 04:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.810 --> 04:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
that sentence Mike
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do this insert new
 
04:38:28.250 --> 04:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
stuff in Gray here
 
04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
except without the sentence about the
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
because I think that this is right that
 
04:38:37.369 --> 04:38:37.379 align:start position:0%
this is too small
 
04:38:37.379 --> 04:38:39.170 align:start position:0%
this is too small
yeah

04:38:39.170 --> 04:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
I should have shot bigger I don't know I
 
04:38:42.051 --> 04:38:42.061 align:start position:0%
was trying to be reasonable as usual
 
04:38:45.289 --> 04:38:45.299 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a place to begin right that's
 
04:38:46.730 --> 04:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
the waters
 
04:38:49.849 --> 04:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for that support
 
04:38:49.859 --> 04:38:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you for that support
um

04:38:50.810 --> 04:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral three trying to
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
recognize uh the tragic lightning
 
04:38:58.010 --> 04:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
strikes our agency experiences and what
 
04:38:59.470 --> 04:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
I've had to go through as a commissioner
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
and giving me some Authority within my
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
agency to help
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
um if we have another tragic event and
 
04:39:09.650 --> 04:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
the resources are not available to help
 
04:39:13.849 --> 04:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
so this is to insert some new powers
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
under statute that do have a cost
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
associated with it out of the duties of
 
04:39:22.369 --> 04:39:22.379 align:start position:0%
the commissioner this language is
 
04:39:24.650 --> 04:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
similar to language under the Department
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
of Labor associative workman's comp
 
04:39:29.689 --> 04:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
claims and opportunities there but it is
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
really a
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
a tragic response to his experience
 
04:39:35.810 --> 04:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
we've we've gone through
 
04:39:38.330 --> 04:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead and representative are any of
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
the corrections agents are under there
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
is a new sort of trend among certain
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
segments of state employees it started
 
04:39:47.280 --> 04:39:48.368 align:start position:0%
segments of state employees it started
with

04:39:48.368 --> 04:39:48.378 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
First Responders I realized maybe
 
04:39:53.630 --> 04:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
Corrections isn't under that of a
 
04:39:56.630 --> 04:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
one-time a hundred thousand dollar death
 
04:39:58.850 --> 04:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
benefit if they die on the line of duty
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
and it has since added additional
 
04:40:01.560 --> 04:40:03.650 align:start position:0%
and it has since added additional
categories

04:40:03.650 --> 04:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
categories
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
um School Employees Public School
 
04:40:09.288 --> 04:40:09.298 align:start position:0%
Employees and now Public Works employees
 
04:40:09.298 --> 04:40:10.070 align:start position:0%
Employees and now Public Works employees
um

04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
have you paid attention to that and
 
04:40:14.570 --> 04:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that wouldn't be
 
04:40:16.610 --> 04:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
something you wouldn't want but is have
 
04:40:19.368 --> 04:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
you paid attention to that evolution of
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
that discussion and might that be better
 
04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz I appreciate that
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
question and yes I have engaged in that
 
04:40:28.850 --> 04:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
and that I was a part of the reason that
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
statute changed to include Corrections
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
Officers and probation and parole
 
04:40:34.850 --> 04:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
officers that's a 100 000 payment to
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
next to Kin if it's determined after 180
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
days to be a line of duty death this was
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
a ask for a more immediate response
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
during the death
 
04:40:49.850 --> 04:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
um that I shall have the power to do
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
that if it's appropriate
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I guess I'm I'm not in favor
 
04:40:58.430 --> 04:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
of this one we have a bill
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
along these lines right so
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
um maybe which is more general for all
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
police and fire in the state I think
 
04:41:12.530 --> 04:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and that would include it's
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
essentially for all group two right so I
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
think that would cover these if
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know so we have we're considering
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing in a different way
 
04:41:22.080 --> 04:41:23.208 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing in a different way
okay

04:41:23.208 --> 04:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
um there are also Federal benefits that
 
04:41:28.368 --> 04:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
I I think apply there's there is a
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal one-time benefit in these cases
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
yeah this was more of uh literally
 
04:41:36.410 --> 04:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
somebody has passed and there is a need
 
04:41:38.930 --> 04:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh in less than seven days to in turn
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
and always cover burial expenses that's
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
why the amounts not to exceed ten
 
04:41:46.128 --> 04:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars yeah it's literally
 
04:41:49.610 --> 04:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
specific to pay burial and week expenses
 
04:41:51.410 --> 04:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
I mean you could think of it at that
 
04:41:54.650 --> 04:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars you know ten
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
thousand of it could come early for this
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
if needed for the burial
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
I just don't feel comfortable doing it
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
for this department and not that
 
04:42:05.448 --> 04:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
department and you know you see what I
 
04:42:06.410 --> 04:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
mean it's
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
could we just like set it aside and see
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
what happens with the other insurance
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're working on yeah
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um I would hope that I never
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
made yeah and the other one navigate
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
that again
 
04:42:20.700 --> 04:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
that again
so

04:42:22.250 --> 04:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:24.410 --> 04:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
so the other interesting thing about
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
that other bill
 
04:42:26.580 --> 04:42:28.310 align:start position:0%
that other bill
um

04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
was it two is this it 250 yeah
 
04:42:31.620 --> 04:42:33.708 align:start position:0%
was it two is this it 250 yeah
is

04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note it doesn't
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
apply to existing spouses who are in
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
this situation right and apparently
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's uh there's 20 of them or
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
so something like that
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
um 19.
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
and surprisingly to me actually only
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
seven police and twelve fire I I had
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
always thought it'd be the other way
 
04:42:58.320 --> 04:42:59.930 align:start position:0%
always thought it'd be the other way
around

04:42:59.930 --> 04:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
um but but but according to this the
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill is only prospective right for new
 
04:43:08.590 --> 04:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
deaths on duty
 
04:43:11.448 --> 04:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
not for
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
um not for those 19 existing so the
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
amount the same ten thousand dollars no
 
04:43:20.090 --> 04:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
no this is it's it's similar but it's
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
not the same it this is about ongoing
 
04:43:25.250 --> 04:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
compensation for surviving spouses
 
04:43:27.050 --> 04:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's that's different though that's
 
04:43:28.490 --> 04:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is the there's a one-time benefit
 
04:43:34.010 --> 04:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
for that's for next again this is for
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
the immediate family one-time benefit to
 
04:43:39.650 --> 04:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
Barry and I can tell you quite frankly
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars won't even do the
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
job according to this
 
04:43:48.288 --> 04:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
um RSA 21i 29a
 
04:43:49.970 --> 04:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
gives a 100
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
000 lump sum benefit so that already is
 
04:43:53.458 --> 04:43:54.590 align:start position:0%
000 lump sum benefit so that already is
there

04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:43:54.600 --> 04:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
there
right

04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:43:55.920 --> 04:43:57.530 align:start position:0%
right
so

04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know there's already a one hundred
 
04:44:02.090 --> 04:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
thousand and I was very involved in the
 
04:44:04.490 --> 04:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
second and the third rounds of these
 
04:44:06.890 --> 04:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
discussions on the other agencies and
 
04:44:10.330 --> 04:44:10.340 align:start position:0%
I'll just say part of that was to help
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
earlier than the existing ongoing system
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
especially uh workers comp will be
 
04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
involved it's above and beyond that it
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be the early
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
safety net that would include expenses
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
like this but she's rated you know I'm
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they all all three of those
 
04:44:30.540 --> 04:44:32.090 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they all all three of those
have

04:44:32.090 --> 04:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
um you know because there's you have to
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
make the determination officially in
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
each case a commissioner is in charge of
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
making that decision if if that worker
 
04:44:45.170 --> 04:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know qualifies
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and then that's 180 days it's 180
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
days from the request for the review so
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
this language that I proposed here was
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
not to give money
 
04:45:00.770 --> 04:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
to the next of kin but to work with the
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
next of kin to pay up to ten thousand
 
04:45:04.930 --> 04:45:04.940 align:start position:0%
dollars for the burial and wake Services
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
because it again
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
I say this carefully hoping to never
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
have this tragic experience again we
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
needed something in less than seven days
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
and the existing statutes had I not been
 
04:45:19.250 --> 04:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
engaged in changing it didn't include a
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
broad definition of law enforcement so
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
there was debate because there were
 
04:45:26.330 --> 04:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
specific terms police firemen that's a
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
blending of First Responders and police
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
officers but if you use the definition
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
under 106l certified law enforcement you
 
04:45:35.090 --> 04:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
will always include Corrections Officers
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
and probation and parole officers when
 
04:45:39.650 --> 04:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
the language starts to get specific it
 
04:45:41.810 --> 04:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
excludes groups that you would
 
04:45:43.610 --> 04:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
inherently had hoped potentially to
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
include so again this was an attempt to
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
say in the worst and hopefully rarest of
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
instances that the commissioner of
 
04:45:55.250 --> 04:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
Corrections shall have the discretion to
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
pay burial and wake services not to
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
exceed that thousand dollars again if if
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
that tragedy strikes and the next of Ken
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
demonstrates demonstrates an inability
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
to afford the burial or wake expenses
 
04:46:11.330 --> 04:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
not to give them a
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
not to give them a lump sum to live off
 
04:46:17.868 --> 04:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
of in compensation but to pay the
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
respects to the employee who died
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
suddenly tragically and unfortunately
 
04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
um for their services and I just want to
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
make a caveat the department pays for
 
04:46:29.330 --> 04:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
the burial services of an Indigent
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
prisoner but I had no path forward to
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
pay for someone who didn't have and I'm
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
not blaming the person they didn't they
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
were very young and no one necessarily
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
thinks of this lightning strike and we
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely engaged in donations and
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
everything else you would expect but I
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
think again this is just a respectful
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
nod to say that lightning strike happens
 
04:46:52.440 --> 04:46:53.448 align:start position:0%
nod to say that lightning strike happens
that

04:46:53.448 --> 04:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
right but the point is you know state
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
troopers need this and commissioner
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
correction sir I'm advocating for the
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner so that's my point I think
 
04:47:04.128 --> 04:47:04.138 align:start position:0%
this should be a different bill is what
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
I think I don't think it's the kind of
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
thing we can do okay in two weeks in the
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
budget but that's my opinion uh
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee you may or may not agree yes
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
you don't mind me asking well um
 
04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
what in a way that is fair and what
 
04:47:21.288 --> 04:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
would be the classification of the
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
worker who passed and what was their
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
what were their wages at the time
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
because I bet it's a lot lower than a
 
04:47:28.730 --> 04:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
State Trooper but I don't know the
 
04:47:28.740 --> 04:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
State Trooper but I don't know the
answer

04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:47:32.208 --> 04:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't go through the analysis of
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
their wages I went through the analysis
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
of how much would it cost at the next of
 
04:47:39.650 --> 04:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
kin couldn't pay and to represent
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
Gabriel's point this would be a
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
yep I guess representative evil would
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
like to come well I just wondered if we
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
one okay all right so this is
 
04:47:57.420 --> 04:47:58.330 align:start position:0%
one okay all right so this is
um

04:47:58.330 --> 04:47:58.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:02.690 --> 04:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
the question is do we want to let's see
 
04:48:05.810 --> 04:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
where is this number three yes okay
 
04:48:09.410 --> 04:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three on the bottom of the
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
second page
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
um honor of Fallen officer the
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall have the power to
 
04:48:17.040 --> 04:48:18.890 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall have the power to
determine

04:48:18.890 --> 04:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
determine
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
um at the commissioner's discretion to
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
pay burial and wake expenses not to
 
04:48:26.448 --> 04:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
exceed ten thousand dollars for an
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
employee whose death occurs while on
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
duty with the department and when the
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
next of kin demonstrates an inability to
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
afford the burial or wake expenses
 
04:48:44.090 --> 04:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
all right so all those in favor of this
 
04:48:48.010 --> 04:48:48.020 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like six to one okay
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.448 --> 04:49:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.458 --> 04:49:07.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:07.788 --> 04:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
what's the historic trend on
 
04:49:15.128 --> 04:49:15.138 align:start position:0%
Correctional deficits dying on duty
 
04:49:18.890 --> 04:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
fortunately not significant but I have
 
04:49:18.900 --> 04:49:20.270 align:start position:0%
fortunately not significant but I have
had

04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I've had
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
a two now two now and I had one officer
 
04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
early on who was actually peddling to
 
04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
work who was struck by a van and killed
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the way to work uh Sergeant Pat
 
04:49:33.840 --> 04:49:35.390 align:start position:0%
on the way to work uh Sergeant Pat
bettens

04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
bettens
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not frequent sir
 
04:49:43.850 --> 04:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
again a rare but tragic event that I
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
want anyone who's in this position to be
 
04:49:50.930 --> 04:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
prepared for
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the more officers work for you than
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
for any other department yes sir I have
 
04:49:59.050 --> 04:49:59.060 align:start position:0%
the technically largest law enforcement
 
04:50:01.250 --> 04:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
agency because I have probation and
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
parole officers Corrections Officers and
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
one could opine and I also have
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
Correctional line Personnel who are
 
04:50:08.170 --> 04:50:08.180 align:start position:0%
group two law enforcement retirees
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
all right anything further for
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
04:50:23.090 --> 04:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
and your support and um let's move on to
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the parole board is here
 
04:50:26.638 --> 04:50:30.170 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the parole board is here
again

04:50:30.170 --> 04:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
is there more to talk about or
 
04:50:36.410 --> 04:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
I thought we we finished that last night
 
04:52:19.970 --> 04:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
so somehow it seems like you were just
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
here and and we uh
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh we we learned
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
what's going on so you have um six
 
04:52:33.420 --> 04:52:36.288 align:start position:0%
what's going on so you have um six
employees

04:52:36.288 --> 04:52:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
is it it's five of you plus one uh one
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
secretary or something like that is it
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
included oh okay okay these are uh the
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
parole staff uh I should introduce
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%

uh on my left
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
the budget that was submitted uh and it
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
is before he was pretty much as we had
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
requested we had asked for to prioritize
 
04:53:15.840 --> 04:53:17.350 align:start position:0%
requested we had asked for to prioritize
needs

04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:53:20.410 --> 04:53:20.420 align:start position:0%
initially but last
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
Friday you addressed those in with the
 
04:53:25.810 --> 04:53:25.820 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:53:28.128 --> 04:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much with the ought to
 
04:53:31.550 --> 04:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
pass of Bill 504
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm here today to ask of the sixth
 
04:53:38.288 --> 04:53:38.298 align:start position:0%
employees in the
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
parole office
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
to our unclassified and four
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
are classified and I'm going I'm asking
 
04:53:51.368 --> 04:53:51.378 align:start position:0%
for a fifth classified employee
 
04:53:51.378 --> 04:53:53.090 align:start position:0%
for a fifth classified employee
we

04:53:53.090 --> 04:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
drastically need
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
an additional CCM uh
 
04:54:03.890 --> 04:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
Corrections case manager to assist us in
 
04:54:07.610 --> 04:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
putting together the parole packets
 
04:54:07.620 --> 04:54:08.448 align:start position:0%
putting together the parole packets
um

04:54:08.448 --> 04:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have to explain a little bit when
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
we digitally uh went through got rid of
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
all our paper products and then now can
 
04:54:20.448 --> 04:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
do a digital presentation so that we all
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
have our uh laptops and and that
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
material is is available for board
 
04:54:27.840 --> 04:54:28.850 align:start position:0%
material is is available for board
members

04:54:28.850 --> 04:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
the the parole packet begins two weeks
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
before the hearing date
 
04:54:38.330 --> 04:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
and it takes almost that entire two-week
 
04:54:41.208 --> 04:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
time to fully prepare the packet there
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
are some 23 different areas that have to
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
be addressed in it
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
since I went on the board in 2019 that
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
job has been done by two different
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
individuals uh uh two of whom have left
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the department because of stress
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh it's in a very stressful job to put
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
this together
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we have a CCM now that's doing it it
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
does a remarkable job but it's very
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to do all of those parole
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.690 --> 04:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
it because of all of that increased work
 
04:55:34.330 --> 04:55:34.340 align:start position:0%
we would ask for an additional CCM to a
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
assist in that
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
he or she would also be able to assist
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
for revocation uh matters
 
04:55:46.448 --> 04:55:46.458 align:start position:0%
and would also free up the time
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
for the director of operations so that
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't have to do some of these
 
04:55:53.810 --> 04:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
things and could do the duties that he
 
04:55:53.820 --> 04:55:54.650 align:start position:0%
things and could do the duties that he
really

04:55:54.650 --> 04:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be would be be doing uh so that
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
we could keep better statistics better
 
04:56:06.410 --> 04:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
track of things so that we we know right
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
now what in a uh six we know right now
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
with in a six-person Department it's
 
04:56:17.530 --> 04:56:17.540 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do all that's required
 
04:56:19.810 --> 04:56:19.820 align:start position:0%
and I think we're
 
04:56:22.250 --> 04:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
extremely pleased with the talent that
 
04:56:23.770 --> 04:56:23.780 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
and certainly want to keep them but I
 
04:56:31.010 --> 04:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
certainly because of the really the high
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
stress job I would request that approval
 
04:56:38.090 --> 04:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
so in the handout today is the the cost
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
of of of doing that uh adding the
 
04:56:45.410 --> 04:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
additional so you saying it um and I
 
04:56:48.850 --> 04:56:48.860 align:start position:0%
would hope the committee would
 
04:56:52.368 --> 04:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
approve our request so we could add that
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
to the budget
 
04:56:57.170 --> 04:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
so you you gave this request to the
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
governor presumably and he said we said
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
no we we did and it was a prioritized
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
need that we we requested
 
04:57:08.330 --> 04:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I recognized that the governor want
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
did not want to increase the number of
 
04:57:14.690 --> 04:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
employees but quite frankly this is a
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
public safety issue we want to make
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
certain that there is a enough
 
04:57:22.850 --> 04:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
information in those packets so that we
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
make good decisions uh and you know a
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
lot of the few years ago requested that
 
04:57:30.850 --> 04:57:30.860 align:start position:0%
we have more information
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
but it took it takes a lot of
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
preparation to put that together and
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's a very stressful time I don't know
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
if the director of operation wants to
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
add anything to that or not but it it it
 
04:57:48.650 --> 04:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of time yeah I can I can
 
04:57:50.570 --> 04:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
have some more um just so identify
 
04:57:52.368 --> 04:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm sorry oh sorry j Mackey
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
director of operations for the pool
 
04:57:53.638 --> 04:57:55.430 align:start position:0%

04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
j h a y Mackey m-a-c-k-e-y
 
04:58:02.810 --> 04:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
now I've been supervising this office
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
for almost two years now July will be
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
two years
 
04:58:06.298 --> 04:58:06.948 align:start position:0%
two years
um

04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
the current case manager that we do have
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
like like uh Roger says does a fantastic
 
04:58:11.760 --> 04:58:13.070 align:start position:0%
like like uh Roger says does a fantastic
job

04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:58:15.550 --> 04:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
um and I I've been in with the doc since
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
2016. so I've known all the people that
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
have worked in that office since before
 
04:58:22.490 --> 04:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I got into the office and I've seen
 
04:58:23.930 --> 04:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
all the stress that they've gone through
 
04:58:27.530 --> 04:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
the one the more recent cccm that left
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
is still a case manager just in a
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
different area now he's working he's
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
back with the doc with in a halfway
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
house and and loving it more than what
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
he did prior to but in addition to
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
preparing for the parole hearings the
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
case manager also sits in on the parole
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
hearings like a court monitor does and
 
04:58:47.570 --> 04:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
takes down all the notes and results of
 
04:58:49.368 --> 04:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
all that so one day a week that person
 
04:58:52.010 --> 04:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
at least one day a week that person is
 
04:58:54.050 --> 04:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
away from their desk and unable to
 
04:58:56.330 --> 04:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
provide all all that information for the
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
upcoming hearings
 
04:58:58.320 --> 04:58:59.448 align:start position:0%
upcoming hearings
um

04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
he's also in charge of the interstate
 
04:59:05.690 --> 04:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
transfer process called icots where
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
people are applying to have their parole
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
supervision done in another state he's
 
04:59:11.868 --> 04:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
responsible for getting all that
 
04:59:14.208 --> 04:59:14.218 align:start position:0%
application work done which is time
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
consuming because you need the uh you
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
need the police reports from the
 
04:59:20.570 --> 04:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
prosecuting agency which is always the
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
biggest one that takes a lot of time
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
like we just had an issue with the AG's
 
04:59:25.368 --> 04:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
office and so we had to actually talk
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
have a nice little talk with them and
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
they understood the process oh we'll get
 
04:59:30.170 --> 04:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
them to you right now that individual
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
waited like two months to be released
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
because of that but that's just added
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
added duties on top of preparing for
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
parole packets that this individual does
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
um having that second case manager it
 
04:59:44.930 --> 04:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
will have the trickle-down effectives
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
the supervisor in the office the
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor for
 
04:59:49.730 --> 04:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
is the one that covers all the
 
04:59:51.650 --> 04:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
revocation hearings now and does the
 
04:59:53.690 --> 04:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
schedule and all that stuff whereas the
 
04:59:55.850 --> 04:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
second case manager can do that so she
 
04:59:57.288 --> 04:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
can have more of a role of the
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
supervisory duties that are in her job
 
04:59:58.920 --> 04:59:59.930 align:start position:0%
supervisory duties that are in her job
description

04:59:59.930 --> 04:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
description
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
which will then again will have an
 
05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
effect on the amount of Duties that I'm
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing that are duties within the office
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
day-to-day duties that where could be
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
taken off of my plate that will free me
 
05:00:13.368 --> 05:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
up to do as Roger said a lot of the Data
 
05:00:13.378 --> 05:00:14.750 align:start position:0%
up to do as Roger said a lot of the Data
Tracking

05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
Tracking
 
05:00:16.970 --> 05:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
um looking at the best practices among
 
05:00:19.610 --> 05:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
the among the other states and how we
 
05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
are falling into line with the national
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
averages and and stuff that um I know
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
like I know there's a bill right now to
 
05:00:27.000 --> 05:00:28.368 align:start position:0%
like I know there's a bill right now to
um

05:00:28.368 --> 05:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
to track the long-term impact of the New
 
05:00:31.850 --> 05:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parole system and that's
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
something I've been trying to do but
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have enough staff
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
questions representative Griffin
 
05:00:45.050 --> 05:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:00:47.208 --> 05:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
answering the question
 
05:00:47.218 --> 05:00:48.110 align:start position:0%
answering the question
um

05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:51.050 --> 05:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
you both talked about stress in this
 
05:00:54.050 --> 05:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
particular job how does it differ from
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the stress any other secretary or any
 
05:00:57.360 --> 05:00:58.128 align:start position:0%
the stress any other secretary or any
other

05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:01:00.170 --> 05:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh person
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
in a similar job
 
05:01:04.730 --> 05:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
would have
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question
 
05:01:07.730 --> 05:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
um so I've been in Corrections for 24
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
years I was an officer as well as a
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
field training officer team member then
 
05:01:17.810 --> 05:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
when I became supervisory you know onto
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
the civilian side so I I've the stress
 
05:01:21.650 --> 05:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
kind of increases the higher you go I
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
can completely understand that what we
 
05:01:26.750 --> 05:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
have is a lot of timelines that need by
 
05:01:28.490 --> 05:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
Statute that we need to have things done
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
by with within the office like when you
 
05:01:32.690 --> 05:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
talk about vacation areas we got to have
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
hearings within 45 days of their arrest
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
and we have we rely on other divisions
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
other agencies to let us know when
 
05:01:40.010 --> 05:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
somebody's incarcerated so we can get
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
them transported to the prison to fall
 
05:01:43.970 --> 05:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
into this guideline
 
05:01:45.890 --> 05:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me we have our our own
 
05:01:47.448 --> 05:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
administrative rules where we have to
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
have somebody
 
05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
um shall have a parole hearing within 60
 
05:01:53.690 --> 05:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
days of their minimum parole date so we
 
05:01:53.700 --> 05:01:54.590 align:start position:0%
days of their minimum parole date so we
have

05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:01:57.770 --> 05:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
um between that we have as soon as they
 
05:01:59.448 --> 05:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
are approved parole we send out the home
 
05:02:01.250 --> 05:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
plans as part of the case manager's jobs
 
05:02:03.650 --> 05:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
has sent out the home plan to give to
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
field services to investigate Say by
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
policy 15 days to investigate that to
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
provide a response to see if this person
 
05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to live at that
 
05:02:14.750 --> 05:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
address so a lot of the stuff we do is
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
Guided by timelines which adds to the
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
stress factor but just the sheer volume
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
of work in itself
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
is mainly the stress factor
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to keep people any longer
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
than they're supposed to be kept so
 
05:02:29.160 --> 05:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
than they're supposed to be kept so
that's

05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.090 --> 05:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
so you you talked about 23 items in a
 
05:02:37.730 --> 05:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
packet but it seemed I don't quite
 
05:02:39.490 --> 05:02:39.500 align:start position:0%
understand that because it seems to me
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
somebody who's sentenced to prison and
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
the day they're sentenced they have a
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
whole court record and and so on right I
 
05:02:50.750 --> 05:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean there's some big judicial record of
 
05:02:52.730 --> 05:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
why you know what happened to them and
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
how they got into prison and then from
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
that point
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
they have
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
however they behave while they're in
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
prison right so presumably everybody has
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
a file and when things happen it goes in
 
05:03:07.250 --> 05:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
that file so what what more than those
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
two sets of Records
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
are involved well a good deal of it
 
05:03:12.718 --> 05:03:13.610 align:start position:0%
are involved well a good deal of it
um

05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes the the Senate saying the the actual
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
we have to have copies of the actual
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
indictments and the sentencing records
 
05:03:23.650 --> 05:03:23.660 align:start position:0%
the the Minimus
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
and then of course when they arrive we
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
have the face sheet so we know when
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
their minimum parole date is whether or
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
not they owe restitution whether or not
 
05:03:36.770 --> 05:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
they owe attorney's fees there are all
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
sorts of issues uh including whether or
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
not they have any pending legal matters
 
05:03:42.120 --> 05:03:43.788 align:start position:0%
not they have any pending legal matters
but

05:03:43.788 --> 05:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:46.850 --> 05:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
there's a our system is the chorus
 
05:03:50.090 --> 05:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
system that has to be accessed to find
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
out everything from their disciplinary
 
05:04:00.410 --> 05:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.410 --> 05:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
um not only their their disciplines but
 
05:04:05.570 --> 05:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
of course all of the courses that
 
05:04:08.208 --> 05:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
they've taken all of the prop progress
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
they've made were also issues such as
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
how they did in Focus or how they did it
 
05:04:18.770 --> 05:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
in a particular matter what kind of
 
05:04:22.970 --> 05:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
Aftercare is required but when putting
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
all of this together it's not a you know
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's in the chorus system but it's not
 
05:04:31.128 --> 05:04:31.138 align:start position:0%
easily located so it has to be taken out
 
05:04:33.890 --> 05:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
and then put separate into this digital
 
05:04:33.900 --> 05:04:35.330 align:start position:0%
and then put separate into this digital
package

05:04:35.330 --> 05:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
package
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
um so that we we have that you know and
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
then there are other things like the
 
05:04:44.770 --> 05:04:44.780 align:start position:0%
resident release synopsis which the CCM
 
05:04:47.868 --> 05:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
the case manager for the individual
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
resident in the in the prison prepares
 
05:04:54.410 --> 05:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
along with the parole application
 
05:04:54.420 --> 05:04:55.610 align:start position:0%
along with the parole application
um

05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:59.330 --> 05:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
um they're but if we go through all of
 
05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
these different steps that has to be
 
05:05:03.550 --> 05:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
done for all
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
15 to 18
 
05:05:08.448 --> 05:05:08.458 align:start position:0%
Parolees that are going to come up for
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
that hearing uh in in two weeks and it
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
takes time to do that at the same time
 
05:05:20.090 --> 05:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
people with they have to get a hold of
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
the health services so we we have
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral health records we have to
 
05:05:26.810 --> 05:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
know what recommendations are are made
 
05:05:29.230 --> 05:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
along those lines too for instance
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
whether a person is unrequired
 
05:05:34.610 --> 05:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
psychiatric medications or is it
 
05:05:38.810 --> 05:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
required or is on a mat program so that
 
05:05:40.970 --> 05:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
there's treatment for his or her
 
05:05:43.810 --> 05:05:43.820 align:start position:0%
addiction all of these things
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
go into our digital package but it's
 
05:05:52.128 --> 05:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
time consuming to do that and often as a
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
pro board member sometimes I we don't
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
get all of this information until the
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
day before hearing and that's that's
 
05:06:04.010 --> 05:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
probably why it's so stressful because
 
05:06:06.890 --> 05:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
there are lots of moving Parts you know
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
the individuals filling out the
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
application doesn't get to his case
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
manager uh the person who's doing the
 
05:06:17.770 --> 05:06:17.780 align:start position:0%
behavioral health summary
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
because they're they need more Personnel
 
05:06:25.368 --> 05:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
they don't get to do it uh that two-page
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
summary or three-page summary until the
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
last minute and so oftentimes we are
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
reading things the day of the Pearl
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing rather than having the time to
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
fully go go through it the way I'd like
 
05:06:40.920 --> 05:06:41.708 align:start position:0%
fully go go through it the way I'd like
to

05:06:41.708 --> 05:06:41.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
so that's really where this where the
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
stress is because there's a lot of what
 
05:06:52.128 --> 05:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
the course is an old system
 
05:06:55.010 --> 05:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and it I wish it would as simple as
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
you you could just go into it and
 
05:07:00.730 --> 05:07:00.740 align:start position:0%
readily find things but it often
 
05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
takes time to even you know enter it and
 
05:07:07.250 --> 05:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
then search it and then get to where you
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
want and then copy it so it's like when
 
05:07:13.610 --> 05:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
did that explanation but that that's
 
05:07:15.890 --> 05:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
what the what the issue is any other
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:07:18.600 --> 05:07:20.150 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
no

05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:07:22.010 --> 05:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative cameras thank you
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh what would you say
 
05:07:25.850 --> 05:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
is the average time it would take to
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
prepare one packet just so we can do
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
some numbers here well we know that it
 
05:07:30.780 --> 05:07:32.050 align:start position:0%
some numbers here well we know that it
it

05:07:32.050 --> 05:07:32.060 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
it takes almost that full two weeks time
 
05:07:41.270 --> 05:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
to uh I know that that our president CCM
 
05:07:41.280 --> 05:07:42.590 align:start position:0%
to uh I know that that our president CCM
starts

05:07:42.590 --> 05:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
starts
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
um the Friday before the
 
05:07:49.368 --> 05:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
the two-week carrying day
 
05:07:52.610 --> 05:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and that's on on a Thursday and he
 
05:07:55.550 --> 05:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
likes to get everything done by the
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
Tuesday of that week because then
 
05:08:00.650 --> 05:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
everything has to be scanned and put in
 
05:08:04.368 --> 05:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
the packets and get into the system so
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the pro board members can access it
 
05:08:07.920 --> 05:08:08.690 align:start position:0%
that the pro board members can access it
um

05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
I know he said to do
 
05:08:14.350 --> 05:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
that it takes almost that entire
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
two-week time period to prepare all well
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
I don't think it
 
05:08:23.690 --> 05:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's never done packet by packet it's
 
05:08:27.050 --> 05:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
done the first I think he starts off
 
05:08:30.530 --> 05:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
first by going into the system to get
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
the indictments and the bit of Misses
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's the first the way each stats are
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
and while you're in there you want to
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
get them for all of the people later on
 
05:08:43.010 --> 05:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh you don't do it one at a time but
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
when you're into the system you want to
 
05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:47.218 align:start position:0%
get as many as you can and get them
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
copied it out
 
05:08:51.530 --> 05:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand the way you're
 
05:08:53.208 --> 05:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
saying this there's one person doing
 
05:08:55.550 --> 05:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
this yes correct so what are the other
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
three employees doing
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
well they're
 
05:09:01.730 --> 05:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
I think our director can answer that
 
05:09:07.610 --> 05:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
better so yes uh the one unclassified
 
05:09:08.990 --> 05:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
position other than me is a part-time
 
05:09:10.970 --> 05:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
secretary and she is the one doing most
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
of the scanning of everything
 
05:09:14.330 --> 05:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
um of all the pro package for both
 
05:09:16.490 --> 05:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
parole and revocation hearings our
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
executive secretary is the one who
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
schedules everyone out for release
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
which she tends to release anywhere from
 
05:09:25.490 --> 05:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
well at least it used to be having done
 
05:09:27.650 --> 05:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
those statistics lately but I know we
 
05:09:29.090 --> 05:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
don't let her do more than 10 in a day
 
05:09:30.650 --> 05:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
because that puts a lot of pressure on
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
all the other divisions to prepare
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
people for Relief so we try to schedule
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
them out as best as we can but she's
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
scheduling people for release every day
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
we have a new uh secretary too who's
 
05:09:41.570 --> 05:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
being trained on doing all the parole
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
scheduling which I had to take over when
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
we when our secretary had retired
 
05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
um but her main function is is doing all
 
05:09:52.368 --> 05:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
the parole hearing schedules
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
um as well as a lot of the home plan
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
stuff sending out Home Plans getting the
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
responses in to give when they're
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
approved to give to the executive
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
secretary who then reviews everything
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
for release
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
um so each person has basically their
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
own set of duties
 
05:10:11.810 --> 05:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
but since we've had multiple people be
 
05:10:12.890 --> 05:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
out for like right now they're
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
supervisor four four is out and we're
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
covering all the revocation stuff for
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
her uh we all know how to do each
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
other's jobs
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
um very a lot more stressful when one
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
person is out for an extended period of
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
time she's now in our third week which
 
05:10:27.288 --> 05:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
she's supposed to be kept coming back
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
next week which is fantastic but
 
05:10:29.638 --> 05:10:30.708 align:start position:0%
next week which is fantastic but
um

05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:33.530 --> 05:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
in addition to with just to give you an
 
05:10:36.410 --> 05:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
idea uh parole packet is usually
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 30 to 60 pages long
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and that just kind of more depends on
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
the length of time that person has
 
05:10:44.810 --> 05:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
served in the prison as well as just
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
their own behaviors and and all that
 
05:10:49.010 --> 05:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
other types of stuff
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
now there's you're releasing roughly 10
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
people a week is that right
 
05:10:56.208 --> 05:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look I want I wanted to
 
05:10:58.010 --> 05:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
start looking at that again since the
 
05:10:59.690 --> 05:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
the numbers have gone down so much over
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
the last few years but there was a time
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
before when I was used to work in
 
05:11:05.208 --> 05:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
another division that they would tell
 
05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
her not to do more than 10 in a day like
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
a schedule they schedule them three to
 
05:11:11.690 --> 05:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
four days out or at least so we have
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
somebody we know can't leave until March
 
05:11:14.520 --> 05:11:15.948 align:start position:0%
somebody we know can't leave until March
14th

05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
14th
 
05:11:18.530 --> 05:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
but everything is squared away she might
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
on today send out the notice that he's
 
05:11:23.570 --> 05:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
being released next Tuesday no
 
05:11:23.580 --> 05:11:24.170 align:start position:0%
being released next Tuesday no
um

05:11:24.170 --> 05:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
I wanted I haven't been able to do the
 
05:11:27.288 --> 05:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
date on how many releases we've done
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
over the past year which is one of the
 
05:11:31.128 --> 05:11:31.138 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to get done I just have
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
in my mind that you're doing 15 hearings
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
a week right and for parole for parole
 
05:11:43.090 --> 05:11:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
what's a revocation that's when uh
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
when someone who's already on parole
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
goes out and violates the parole rules
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
and regulations or sometimes commits a
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
crime and then a warrant has to be
 
05:12:05.930 --> 05:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
prepared and then a warrant is issued
 
05:12:08.868 --> 05:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
and then within 45 days of their arrest
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
there must be a due process hearing so
 
05:12:12.718 --> 05:12:13.930 align:start position:0%
there must be a due process hearing so
the

05:12:13.930 --> 05:12:13.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
revocation hearings are held on Tuesdays
 
05:12:19.628 --> 05:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
of every week
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
and the parole hearings are held on
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
Thursday for instance that CCM who's
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing the parole packets sits the other
 
05:12:31.490 --> 05:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
CCM is out on leave
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
must come in on every Tuesday so he
 
05:12:38.510 --> 05:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
loses a whole day there uh doing the the
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
but in any case the parole hearings 15 a
 
05:12:49.010 --> 05:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
week you approve 70 percent so that's
 
05:12:52.730 --> 05:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 or 11. something like that
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
correct yeah generally generally yeah
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
we don't really have our
 
05:13:11.218 --> 05:13:13.250 align:start position:0%
we don't really have our
uh

05:13:13.250 --> 05:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:16.368 --> 05:13:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:20.690 --> 05:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know our requirements and so
 
05:13:23.690 --> 05:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
maybe we should keep this
 
05:13:23.700 --> 05:13:26.868 align:start position:0%
maybe we should keep this
perfect

05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
things that if you have an extra hundred
 
05:13:29.280 --> 05:13:38.750 align:start position:0%
things that if you have an extra hundred
thousand

05:13:38.750 --> 05:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:40.128 --> 05:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:13:40.138 --> 05:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
that's right
yeah

05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:48.288 --> 05:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
so if someone is on parole and they have
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
to do periodic check-ins who are they
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
checking in with with the probation
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
parole officers okay who they're they're
 
05:14:02.110 --> 05:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay I just wondered
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Corrections right
 
05:14:08.690 --> 05:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
and my other question as the clerk
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
because I stepped outside
 
05:14:12.770 --> 05:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
could you just give me your name
 
05:14:15.890 --> 05:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm Roger Phillips Phillips okay with a
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
double L
 
05:14:21.530 --> 05:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
our probation officers officers group
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
so in Massachusetts probation officer is
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
another person and our state the
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
information and parole officers with a
 
05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
singular person
 
05:14:44.580 --> 05:14:52.190 align:start position:0%
singular person
employees

05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:52.200 --> 05:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
all right yes uh my
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
just a clarification is the
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
complete Budget on hold or just the
 
05:15:05.890 --> 05:15:05.900 align:start position:0%
additional position request
 
05:15:10.490 --> 05:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah just the additional position right
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any do we have any
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
problem with the existing budget as set
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
by the governor no right
 
05:15:18.900 --> 05:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
by the governor no right
huh

05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
huh
 
05:15:22.970 --> 05:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
at this point I don't think we know
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
exactly where we're at we know we know
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
we gotta uh we gotta find some money
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah or something to meet the budget
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections were not what we
 
05:15:35.400 --> 05:15:37.250 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections were not what we
expected

05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
expected
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz I realize I'm the
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
clueless not Committee Member here but
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like some of this role would
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
save money in the long run if someone is
 
05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
waiting to be
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
released from prison you know and they
 
05:15:53.090 --> 05:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
have to wait because they don't have the
 
05:15:55.368 --> 05:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
Staffing I wonder if that pays for
 
05:15:55.378 --> 05:15:57.530 align:start position:0%
Staffing I wonder if that pays for
itself

05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:16:00.410 --> 05:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
do you want to comment on them
 
05:16:02.448 --> 05:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
well that sort of is yeah well that's
 
05:16:04.910 --> 05:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
true I mean obviously we want to meet a
 
05:16:07.490 --> 05:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
due process requirements
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
um and we want to make sure that we have
 
05:16:12.530 --> 05:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
all the information available and not
 
05:16:14.890 --> 05:16:14.900 align:start position:0%
continue a hearing
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes people
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
and and I know sometimes the Department
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
of Corrections would love to see more
 
05:16:25.550 --> 05:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
paroled but we want to make sure that
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
paroled successfully so that's the
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's our goal and that's why we're an
 
05:16:35.090 --> 05:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
independent quasi-judicial agent agency
 
05:16:37.610 --> 05:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
just to make that decision so that we
 
05:16:40.850 --> 05:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
can add puts in the message is not only
 
05:16:43.550 --> 05:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the parolee but of the citizens of
 
05:16:48.410 --> 05:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
Sweeney sorry I figured I should ask
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
while I have you here so we did have on
 
05:16:55.730 --> 05:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
Friday we had 504 that would do the uh
 
05:16:59.930 --> 05:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
increases to the Commissioners 51 500
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
per year we have this additional request
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
for 83 000 in the first year and 87 000
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the second year correct if we had to
 
05:17:09.890 --> 05:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
prioritize I know it's the worst
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
question to be asked if you had to
 
05:17:13.610 --> 05:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
choose one or the other which would you
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
choose well it's difficult too because
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
what happens if we don't have the packet
 
05:17:21.050 --> 05:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
the people that you just gave the raise
 
05:17:22.930 --> 05:17:22.940 align:start position:0%
so can't review
 
05:17:26.330 --> 05:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
on on the other hand if you have the
 
05:17:28.368 --> 05:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
packet that we lose for old board
 
05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
members then we're not going to have
 
05:17:33.530 --> 05:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
anyone to review those packets so it
 
05:17:38.448 --> 05:17:38.458 align:start position:0%
really goes hand in hand thank you I
 
05:17:41.690 --> 05:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
I tried to but the only thing I'd be
 
05:17:44.208 --> 05:17:44.218 align:start position:0%
willing to give up is calling on a prior
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
board member to sit but that's only a
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
1500 item
 
05:17:48.840 --> 05:17:50.030 align:start position:0%
1500 item
yeah

05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:17:54.530 --> 05:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:56.770 --> 05:17:56.780 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
let me talk about it this way the number
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
of of inmates is going down
 
05:18:08.030 --> 05:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
so therefore I would assume your work is
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
the population I I think it was
 
05:18:21.050 --> 05:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
remaining pretty close to 2000. our
 
05:18:23.690 --> 05:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
people are qualifying for some parole
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
hearings more quickly so we're doing
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
about the same number of parole hearing
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
as we were before
 
05:18:31.080 --> 05:18:32.628 align:start position:0%
as we were before
but

05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:18:34.610 --> 05:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
see the
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
um three and a half to seven year
 
05:18:39.770 --> 05:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
sentences we're seeing a lot of one to
 
05:18:41.930 --> 05:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
five year sentences a one to four year
 
05:18:44.448 --> 05:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
sentences sometimes they're violations
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
of probations uh because they're they're
 
05:18:47.520 --> 05:18:48.770 align:start position:0%
of probations uh because they're they're
placed

05:18:48.770 --> 05:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
placed
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
back in in prison because they violated
 
05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
the give the drug court or something
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
else so actually the the number of
 
05:19:00.890 --> 05:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
herrings I I think it would uh are going
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
to remain pretty steady it'll be about
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
1400 a year uh between
 
05:19:19.930 --> 05:19:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it
 
05:20:21.410 --> 05:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:45.410 --> 05:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
shall we get started
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:12.650 --> 05:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.770 --> 05:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
this budget starts on the bottom of page
 
05:32:15.780 --> 05:32:17.510 align:start position:0%
this budget starts on the bottom of page
14.

05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
14.
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
and goes through Page 18. it's within
 
05:32:49.730 --> 05:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
so do we generally not look at the
 
05:32:51.840 --> 05:32:53.150 align:start position:0%
so do we generally not look at the
governor's

05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
budget itself
 
05:32:57.410 --> 05:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
Pages 12
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
Etc that's correct no good yeah
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
just like we don't look at the
 
05:33:03.200 --> 05:33:03.210 align:start position:0%
legislative but
 
05:33:03.210 --> 05:33:06.070 align:start position:0%
legislative but
[Laughter]

05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
unlimited funds all right so um page 14
 
05:33:09.600 --> 05:33:10.730 align:start position:0%
unlimited funds all right so um page 14
commissioner

05:33:10.730 --> 05:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:33:10.740 --> 05:33:12.170 align:start position:0%
commissioner
[Music]

05:33:12.170 --> 05:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:33:12.180 --> 05:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
all right thank you please
 
05:33:22.250 --> 05:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
um introduce yourself
 
05:33:37.930 --> 05:33:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
to my left is the what we refer to as
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
the gcd the gcd's business administrator
 
05:33:49.610 --> 05:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:52.670 --> 05:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
could you spell the last name d as in
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.360 --> 05:34:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:34:01.550 --> 05:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:04.730 --> 05:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
all right shall we go go through your
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah if that if that would
 
05:34:09.288 --> 05:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
please you uh Mr chair so I have we have
 
05:34:11.810 --> 05:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
put together a PowerPoint
 
05:34:13.850 --> 05:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
um it's a robust PowerPoint and in the
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
interest of um time what I can do is
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
take you through the pages which I
 
05:34:21.050 --> 05:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
believe are most relevant for today's
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
hearing obviously with a focus on the
 
05:34:23.400 --> 05:34:24.708 align:start position:0%
hearing obviously with a focus on the
budget

05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:34:24.718 --> 05:34:25.850 align:start position:0%
budget
um

05:34:25.850 --> 05:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:28.850 --> 05:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
so we can start on page one and when we
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
look at the governor's Commission on
 
05:34:33.050 --> 05:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
disability from a from a from the
 
05:34:35.090 --> 05:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
substantive nature of what it does on a
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
regular basis it's all about the
 
05:34:38.690 --> 05:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act
 
05:34:40.368 --> 05:34:40.378 align:start position:0%
um the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
05:34:43.128 --> 05:34:43.138 align:start position:0%
also known as the Ada was a piece of
 
05:34:46.970 --> 05:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
federal legislation passed in 1990
 
05:34:49.250 --> 05:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the picture there is with President
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
George H.W bush signing the Ada into law
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
on July 26th and essentially the Ada is
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
a civil rights law
 
05:35:00.770 --> 05:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
that prohibits discrimination based on a
 
05:35:04.250 --> 05:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
disability so on a regular basis we look
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
at the Ada and we try to assist the
 
05:35:07.490 --> 05:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
constituents of the State of New
 
05:35:07.500 --> 05:35:08.350 align:start position:0%
constituents of the State of New
Hampshire

05:35:08.350 --> 05:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
under the Ada there are certain titles
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
there's title one which deals with the
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
employment of individuals with
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities Title II which applies the
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
Ada to State and local governments and
 
05:35:22.030 --> 05:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
title III which is public accommodations
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
essentially if you're a private business
 
05:35:26.750 --> 05:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
a hotel a restaurant the law office
 
05:35:29.208 --> 05:35:29.218 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be if it's open to the
 
05:35:32.810 --> 05:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
public it's subject to the Ada also as a
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
as a piece of federal legislation so on
 
05:35:37.970 --> 05:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
a regular basis that's what the gcd does
 
05:35:41.330 --> 05:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
I I think Mr Chia you had referenced our
 
05:35:43.368 --> 05:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
agency is Right within the governor's
 
05:35:45.288 --> 05:35:45.298 align:start position:0%
office so when we look at the statutory
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
structure of the gcd that's where we are
 
05:35:50.208 --> 05:35:50.218 align:start position:0%
not physically but it's uh it's within
 
05:35:54.110 --> 05:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
on the budget on page two
 
05:35:57.050 --> 05:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
the gcd is made up of an executive
 
05:36:01.970 --> 05:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
director and sitting side by side to the
 
05:36:04.250 --> 05:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
executive director is the commission
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
members which uh Governor appointed
 
05:36:08.810 --> 05:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
commission members of which we have 17
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
of them and there are six statutorily
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
assigned ex-official members I'm
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
comprising various commissioners of
 
05:36:18.970 --> 05:36:18.980 align:start position:0%
state government
 
05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
and on page three that is our org chart
 
05:36:28.490 --> 05:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
and the gcd we already I say this often
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
and we are a smaller Agency for the
 
05:36:32.448 --> 05:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but as we all
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
know there are a good amount of small
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
agencies in New Hampshire we are
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
comprised of seven individuals that
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
actually out of staff and you know if I
 
05:36:41.690 --> 05:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
could have the opportunity to say a
 
05:36:44.330 --> 05:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
special thanks to my entire staff on a
 
05:36:46.730 --> 05:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
regular basis they they obviously do the
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the subject matter uh heavy lift in
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with the constituents um for the
 
05:36:53.690 --> 05:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you a question so I'm
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
looking on page 18 of the budget and it
 
05:37:00.650 --> 05:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
looks to me like you have six
 
05:37:03.410 --> 05:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
am I looking on the wrong thing six not
 
05:37:07.310 --> 05:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
seven uh because if I'm not mistaken it
 
05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't the budget doesn't account for a
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
part-time employee so out of that seven
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is one part-time employee I should
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
have clarified that I apologize thank
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah sure
 
05:37:21.770 --> 05:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
um on page four again we um we serve as
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
a source of information
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh a source of research and our job is
 
05:37:29.090 --> 05:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
to advise the governor the New Hampshire
 
05:37:32.090 --> 05:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
legislature other state agencies as it
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
deals with the Ada on a regular basis
 
05:37:38.090 --> 05:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we ensure in what we try to do is we
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
really strive for collaboration among
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
state government I've always held the
 
05:37:44.330 --> 05:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
position and and it's really a core of
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
the gcd we all play on the same team and
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to look at that and
 
05:37:50.570 --> 05:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
really to look at the state agencies and
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
if they have a question about the Ada
 
05:37:54.170 --> 05:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
call on us and we'll see what we can do
 
05:37:55.490 --> 05:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
05:37:58.010 --> 05:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so that is Page four
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
um again these are some of the core
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
functions we admit as um as an agency we
 
05:38:02.878 --> 05:38:04.670 align:start position:0%
functions we admit as um as an agency we
administer

05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
administer
 
05:38:06.890 --> 05:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
um on page five the New Hampshire able
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
savings account which has been
 
05:38:13.368 --> 05:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
authorized by 195 RSA 195k under the
 
05:38:16.368 --> 05:38:16.378 align:start position:0%
statute the state treasurer and the
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
executive director of the governance
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
command mission on disability administ
 
05:38:21.170 --> 05:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
this this program we can get into that a
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
little bit later very similar to college
 
05:38:24.650 --> 05:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
savings plans for individuals with a
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
disability we Implement 100 federally
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
funded client assistance program again
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
that deals with Title One Employment of
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
the Ada we administer the our the
 
05:38:38.690 --> 05:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications equipment assistance
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
program known as teep which is funded by
 
05:38:46.310 --> 05:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
the puc on page six we receive an annual
 
05:38:46.320 --> 05:38:47.770 align:start position:0%
the puc on page six we receive an annual
appropriation

05:38:47.770 --> 05:38:47.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily to fund nfb newsline which
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that individuals who may have a
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
disability and which rent is that they
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
can't read the printed word this is like
 
05:39:01.090 --> 05:39:01.100 align:start position:0%
a a reader for them
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
there is a statutory committee known as
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
the architectural barrier for design
 
05:39:08.690 --> 05:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee which opines on physical
 
05:39:11.948 --> 05:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
accessibility in private
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
companies as well as state government
 
05:39:16.250 --> 05:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
and we house an independent living
 
05:39:16.260 --> 05:39:17.690 align:start position:0%
and we house an independent living
Council

05:39:17.690 --> 05:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
Council
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
with funding from the Department of
 
05:39:20.100 --> 05:39:21.470 align:start position:0%
with funding from the Department of
Education

05:39:21.470 --> 05:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
what we have seen and I think you all
 
05:39:25.610 --> 05:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
know in in order to get the word out in
 
05:39:27.530 --> 05:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
order to really deal with the consent to
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
to give the information to the
 
05:39:30.890 --> 05:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
constituents of New Hampshire we have a
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
very robust social media presence both
 
05:39:35.090 --> 05:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
on Facebook and Twitter we're in the
 
05:39:37.550 --> 05:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
process of updating our website now
 
05:39:40.490 --> 05:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
because again with with a smaller office
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
and with limited bandwidth whatever we
 
05:39:43.970 --> 05:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
have to do to get the information out if
 
05:39:46.250 --> 05:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
we can do it in a sense that is free
 
05:39:48.530 --> 05:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
till for lack of a better term we we
 
05:39:51.050 --> 05:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
look at it as a a practical no cost
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
option um for collaboration and I must I
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
do have to really emphasize when it
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
comes to social media it really is
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
having a social media committee a group
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
that we have internally that meets on a
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
weekly basis we're not just posting for
 
05:40:06.650 --> 05:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
the sake of posting where it's really a
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
deliberate attempt to get the needed
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
information out and to look what is
 
05:40:11.570 --> 05:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:40:14.570 --> 05:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
um in the com in the community
 
05:40:16.730 --> 05:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
and page eight goes over some of the
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
resources I won't get into the details
 
05:40:20.690 --> 05:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
and some of the various committees that
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have been assigned to
 
05:40:26.690 --> 05:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
um page nine really looks at three of
 
05:40:29.448 --> 05:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
the positions at the gcd one is the
 
05:40:31.490 --> 05:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
accessibility specialist
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
that position is vacant right now it's
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
been vacant for um since September and
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the accessibility specialist looks at
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
what we refer to the as the physical
 
05:40:39.600 --> 05:40:41.330 align:start position:0%
what we refer to the as the physical
environment

05:40:41.330 --> 05:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:40:44.570 --> 05:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
to see if it's in in compliance with the
 
05:40:47.628 --> 05:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
2010 Ada standards for accessible design
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
the lack of a better explanation does a
 
05:40:53.110 --> 05:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
bathroom need a grab bar
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
does they have to be a ramp all of the
 
05:40:58.850 --> 05:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
necessary regulations the title One
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
Employment Specialist works right within
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
the realm of an individual with a
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
disability either currently working in
 
05:41:09.770 --> 05:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
requesting possible accommodations such
 
05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
as let's say a screen reader if a person
 
05:41:15.530 --> 05:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
is blind or vision impaired so the title
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
One Employment Specialist is
 
05:41:19.368 --> 05:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
consistently working with employment
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
matters and our research and information
 
05:41:23.810 --> 05:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
Specialists as the individual that takes
 
05:41:26.208 --> 05:41:26.218 align:start position:0%
in the vast majority of the calls that
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
come in
 
05:41:30.530 --> 05:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
we keep an internal log that we will go
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
over on page next page on page 10. the
 
05:41:35.690 --> 05:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
one you know the top three calls that we
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
get deal with service animals and those
 
05:41:40.910 --> 05:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
come from individuals who own service
 
05:41:43.128 --> 05:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
animals from businesses that are asking
 
05:41:46.190 --> 05:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
the question is it a service animal
 
05:41:50.090 --> 05:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
um the another a major component of the
 
05:41:51.470 --> 05:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
log and the calls that we get on a
 
05:41:53.208 --> 05:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
regular basis deal with the American
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act in
 
05:41:57.770 --> 05:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation requests and
 
05:42:00.170 --> 05:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
also building compliance as I said so
 
05:42:01.610 --> 05:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
those are the top three calls that come
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
into that we're comp continually
 
05:42:03.958 --> 05:42:04.628 align:start position:0%
into that we're comp continually
um

05:42:04.628 --> 05:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:07.550 --> 05:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
working with in all of the positions
 
05:42:09.410 --> 05:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned on page nine what you
 
05:42:10.910 --> 05:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
see is a collaboration with state
 
05:42:12.890 --> 05:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
government for example the accessibility
 
05:42:14.570 --> 05:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
specialist will work with the Department
 
05:42:17.208 --> 05:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services may work with
 
05:42:20.330 --> 05:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
HHS if HHS is thinking of entering into
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
a lease a third-party lease to open up a
 
05:42:25.448 --> 05:42:25.458 align:start position:0%
satellite office
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
the Employment Specialist will work with
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
other entities or bureaus over at HHS
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
and research and information has a
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
direct Pipeline and consistently works
 
05:42:39.050 --> 05:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office his office of
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
constituent services
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
so with that we can
 
05:42:48.890 --> 05:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
jump to page 13
 
05:42:52.128 --> 05:42:52.138 align:start position:0%
which essentially will go over what our
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
budget is all about and I and I know
 
05:42:55.550 --> 05:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's the really what we're trying to
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
focus on for today
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
um again as stated we respectfully
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
submit that the continued adequate
 
05:43:03.770 --> 05:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
funding of the governance Commission on
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
disability is essential to ensure the
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
mandates delegated to the gcd
 
05:43:10.910 --> 05:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
um also the gov we suggest that the
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget in each
 
05:43:12.480 --> 05:43:14.090 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget in each
year

05:43:14.090 --> 05:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:43:17.208 --> 05:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
um is in line with the FY 22 actuals and
 
05:43:19.550 --> 05:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
23 adjusted authorized
 
05:43:21.730 --> 05:43:21.740 align:start position:0%
and on page 14
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
um basically goes over the target we
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
were able to hit the target in both
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
years of the biennium
 
05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
we were
 
05:43:34.610 --> 05:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
um and correct me if I'm wrong Stacy
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
um we were just 35 000 under
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
um within the target
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
um for FY 24 and 35
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
000 in FY 25.
 
05:43:46.670 --> 05:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so that is truly substantially lower
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
than what the governor had requested at
 
05:43:50.448 --> 05:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
the governor's face
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
um coupled with that there is a an
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs request
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's built into that and we
 
05:43:58.610 --> 05:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
respectfully are requesting a part-time
 
05:44:01.490 --> 05:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
position at the gcd
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
um when we go to what the APN actually
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
comes down to
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and with no
 
05:44:12.048 --> 05:44:12.058 align:start position:0%
disrespect intended we would go over the
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
Target by 6 000 and FY 24 and 7 000 um
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
in fy25 so on page 15
 
05:44:24.410 --> 05:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
um that actually breaks down the salary
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
for the um part-timer in
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
24 it would come to Thirty One Thousand
 
05:44:33.610 --> 05:44:33.620 align:start position:0%
four twenty seven
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
benefits would come to 25.87 and the
 
05:44:39.470 --> 05:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
additional laptop and software is just
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
under 4 000 so it's a request of 37 980
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
for that position and an FY 25 it would
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
be 37 144. there are other prioritized
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
needs requests that I'm requesting on
 
05:44:56.448 --> 05:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
behalf of doit that actually had come
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
into our budget exclusive of our
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs requests to
 
05:45:06.530 --> 05:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
the tune of about 3 200 in FY 24 in
 
05:45:10.570 --> 05:45:10.580 align:start position:0%
almost 3 400 in fy25
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
so on page 16 is a little bit about the
 
05:45:16.190 --> 05:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
Ada coordinator
 
05:45:19.970 --> 05:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
just by way of background to to let you
 
05:45:22.010 --> 05:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
if I could explain to you where this
 
05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
request is coming from
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
um a few years back
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
um in working with the governor's office
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
there was a request by constituents to
 
05:45:31.970 --> 05:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
look at the rates of the hiring of
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities just
 
05:45:35.208 --> 05:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and the gcd formed itself into an
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
internal committee and we put together
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
what was known as the workforce focus
 
05:45:44.570 --> 05:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
group and at the table where consumers
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire state agencies and
 
05:45:50.510 --> 05:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
and we what we tried to do is to look at
 
05:45:53.330 --> 05:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
um how what the hiring practices were
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and
 
05:45:56.390 --> 05:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do to make it better
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
because I think at the end of the day we
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
can always make everything a bit better
 
05:46:03.770 --> 05:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations that came out
 
05:46:06.048 --> 05:46:06.058 align:start position:0%
of the workforce focus group was to
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps have an ADA coordinator a person
 
05:46:10.610 --> 05:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
who could sit in a position that if an
 
05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
individual is gainfully employed by the
 
05:46:14.810 --> 05:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and that person
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
has a disability
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
during their tenure ship of employment
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
there are requests that may come up what
 
05:46:22.970 --> 05:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
we refer to as accommodations
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
what we see in in state agencies and
 
05:46:28.448 --> 05:46:28.458 align:start position:0%
this is just across the country
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
the traditional HR person may not be as
 
05:46:36.590 --> 05:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
versed in Ada matters as others May so
 
05:46:38.810 --> 05:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
we looked at it and said maybe to have
 
05:46:42.530 --> 05:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
this person sit at the gcd with close
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the division of
 
05:46:46.910 --> 05:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
personnel to get to to assist agencies
 
05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and in navigating these waters I'll be
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
the first to admit when when you're a
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor when you're an employee if if
 
05:46:56.330 --> 05:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
that isn't your subject matter I don't
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
want to use the word expertise but even
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
exposure traditional HR it can be
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat trying so we looked at this as
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
a as an opportunity again to bring the
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
state together to work together so that
 
05:47:09.410 --> 05:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
was the request we have and that's why
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's a request for a part-time position
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
um in both um in both years the rest of
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bullets are on page 16 deal with
 
05:47:22.010 --> 05:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
um again we envision working with DLP
 
05:47:25.128 --> 05:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
luckily we actually are tenants of 54
 
05:47:26.570 --> 05:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
Regional Drive where the division of
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
personnel is located so we're in the
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
same building right now with Personnel
 
05:47:31.730 --> 05:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
so we have a great relationship
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
um with them so you know this for me and
 
05:47:38.270 --> 05:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm containing my my excitement this is
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity I would say you know
 
05:47:41.930 --> 05:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
there are principles across the country
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
known as same state as model employer
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day I think that's
 
05:47:48.410 --> 05:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
what we all want we want the state of
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as with all uh even
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
private sector to be a model employer
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
and this is this is leaning in that
 
05:47:54.420 --> 05:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
and this is this is leaning in that
direction

05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:47:58.250 --> 05:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so your your consideration for that
 
05:48:01.250 --> 05:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
request is is truly greatly appreciated
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
other than that that's the PowerPoint I
 
05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
didn't want to give too deep a dive but
 
05:48:08.170 --> 05:48:08.180 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to answer questions
 
05:48:10.610 --> 05:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
directly on the budget or any of the
 
05:48:13.490 --> 05:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:17.208 --> 05:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
yes let's go to page 19 of the budget
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
which is your bottom line yes
 
05:48:20.400 --> 05:48:21.110 align:start position:0%
which is your bottom line yes
um

05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:24.410 --> 05:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
so you you spent considerably
 
05:48:24.420 --> 05:48:27.230 align:start position:0%
so you you spent considerably
less

05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.850 --> 05:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I'm on the wrong sorry
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's page 18. sorry page 18. you've
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
spent considerably less in fiscal year
 
05:48:39.530 --> 05:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
22 than than any of the numbers going
 
05:48:42.490 --> 05:48:42.500 align:start position:0%
forward so in general funds you spent
 
05:48:47.868 --> 05:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
360 then a five 358
 
05:48:52.850 --> 05:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so 358 000 as opposed to these 500
 
05:48:55.730 --> 05:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
Plus numbers
 
05:48:58.730 --> 05:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay hey Jay team of the budget okay
 
05:49:01.490 --> 05:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's um in other words if I
 
05:49:03.650 --> 05:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
may miss the chair just to clarify so
 
05:49:06.530 --> 05:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're looking at actuals of 357 904 and
 
05:49:08.570 --> 05:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
then I have an adjusted authorized 536
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
and then the recommended of 558 893.
 
05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
now if I may
 
05:49:19.070 --> 05:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
ask Stacy a question to ensure the 558
 
05:49:21.770 --> 05:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
does that include client assistance and
 
05:49:21.780 --> 05:49:24.590 align:start position:0%
does that include client assistance and
silk

05:49:24.590 --> 05:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:29.330 --> 05:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
performance no the 558 is just for I
 
05:49:31.610 --> 05:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
think the biggest one for for fiscal
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
year 2022 we had two vacancies one of
 
05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
them was bacon I think the whole year
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
this accessibility specialist I think
 
05:49:41.280 --> 05:49:42.368 align:start position:0%
this accessibility specialist I think
that

05:49:42.368 --> 05:49:42.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:49:46.570 --> 05:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
is perhaps a good portion of it
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
is that an unclassified position no
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's a classified position in class 10
 
05:49:52.970 --> 05:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
so that was vacant for quite some time
 
05:49:55.788 --> 05:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
and so was the um
 
05:49:55.798 --> 05:49:57.530 align:start position:0%
and so was the um
the

05:49:57.530 --> 05:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
secretary the admin secretary so we were
 
05:50:02.750 --> 05:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
down position for for a while that and
 
05:50:05.090 --> 05:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
she's which are now filled uh one is
 
05:50:07.490 --> 05:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
filled and one is not filled that's the
 
05:50:09.170 --> 05:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
one that we're posting right now and
 
05:50:10.850 --> 05:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been vacant since
 
05:50:13.368 --> 05:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
September gotcha Now You're Expecting
 
05:50:19.548 --> 05:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:22.368 --> 05:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
well I think it's it depends the the gcd
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
is made up of two accounting units so we
 
05:50:27.048 --> 05:50:27.058 align:start position:0%
have one zero zero four and one zero
 
05:50:30.048 --> 05:50:30.058 align:start position:0%
zero six one zero zero six is a hundred
 
05:50:32.208 --> 05:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
percent Federal uh to the tune of about
 
05:50:32.218 --> 05:50:34.570 align:start position:0%
percent Federal uh to the tune of about
137

05:50:34.570 --> 05:50:34.580 align:start position:0%
137
 
05:50:39.048 --> 05:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:40.850 --> 05:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
a lot right so that that continues
 
05:50:42.770 --> 05:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
forward for that accounting unit and the
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
one individual one classified individual
 
05:50:48.110 --> 05:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
that is in that program and built within
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
one zero zero four is we do receive
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
funds from the Department of Education
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
um or
 
05:50:59.448 --> 05:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
for silk and the amount I think the
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
total appropriation is ninety thousand
 
05:51:01.440 --> 05:51:03.890 align:start position:0%
total appropriation is ninety thousand
yes

05:51:03.890 --> 05:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that is in our so in other words
 
05:51:07.970 --> 05:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
when we look at one zero zero four Mr
 
05:51:10.610 --> 05:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
chair the funds coming from the state of
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
are already in those numbers that we
 
05:51:18.048 --> 05:51:18.058 align:start position:0%
would have to break down for you
 
05:51:18.058 --> 05:51:22.310 align:start position:0%
would have to break down for you
okay

05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.368 --> 05:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
all right so mainly it's unfilled
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
positions yeah there is um one part-time
 
05:51:33.650 --> 05:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:35.390 --> 05:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
Federal funding program
 
05:51:41.810 --> 05:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
as well that was not felt in the in the
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
it's not filled now and it wasn't until
 
05:51:45.708 --> 05:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
right and the other accountant unit one
 
05:51:47.690 --> 05:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
zero zero six which is the Federal which
 
05:51:51.230 --> 05:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
is 100 Federal okay and the other funds
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
is this the Department of Education
 
05:52:00.650 --> 05:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
sure we receive um there's an
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the puc
 
05:52:09.288 --> 05:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
um of 96 000 per year per statute to run
 
05:52:10.810 --> 05:52:10.820 align:start position:0%
the Telecommunications equipment
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
assistance program the funds from the
 
05:52:16.430 --> 05:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
puc and not General funds they come from
 
05:52:19.250 --> 05:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
the relay service trust fund and those
 
05:52:22.610 --> 05:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
funds are garnished from what they call
 
05:52:25.128 --> 05:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
land provide is local Access Network
 
05:52:27.410 --> 05:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
VoIP providers basically the telephone
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
company and whoever's provides so they
 
05:52:32.750 --> 05:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
get that money in the trust fund 96 000
 
05:52:34.910 --> 05:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
comes over to governance Commission on
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
disability to run that program we put it
 
05:52:40.670 --> 05:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
out to an RFP every two years and they
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
also fund newsline for the blind to the
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
tune of about is it 31.5 31 500 which is
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
included in there also thank you
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
questions from the community
 
05:52:58.250 --> 05:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:12.048 --> 05:53:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:13.850 --> 05:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
I want to
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I have the doit with me
 
05:53:19.250 --> 05:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for that representative
 
05:53:19.260 --> 05:53:21.048 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for that representative
um

05:53:21.048 --> 05:53:21.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:23.448 --> 05:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
if I'm I don't think that if I may I
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that that built in any um
 
05:53:28.970 --> 05:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
equipment that was the other fees to
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
support the gcd if I'm not mistaken yeah
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
the only we do have equipment but that's
 
05:53:38.208 --> 05:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
in typically in the efficiency budget
 
05:53:41.448 --> 05:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
um but the other
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
let me just look back are you asking
 
05:53:48.110 --> 05:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
about so in other words page 17. so the
 
05:53:52.010 --> 05:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
31 51 and 33.81 okay so basically if you
 
05:53:54.048 --> 05:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
look at the Ada coordinator the laptop
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:00.530 --> 05:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
um that is class 27 as well and that's
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
for a new laptop monitors
 
05:54:05.890 --> 05:54:05.900 align:start position:0%
um any additional
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
licenses it needs for for the laptop
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and whatnot those I believe are numbers
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we received from doit and then the
 
05:54:20.330 --> 05:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
line number two is not any appointment
 
05:54:22.850 --> 05:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
on our par it's for
 
05:54:22.860 --> 05:54:24.650 align:start position:0%
on our par it's for
um

05:54:24.650 --> 05:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:27.170 --> 05:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
their services for the services provided
 
05:54:31.010 --> 05:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
from doit to support the gcd
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
but would we need those
 
05:54:36.010 --> 05:54:36.020 align:start position:0%
only with if we take the Ada coordinator
 
05:54:39.530 --> 05:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
or or do we need those always
 
05:54:41.390 --> 05:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken correct me if I'm
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
wrong the 3151 is exclusive of the Ada
 
05:54:45.000 --> 05:54:46.010 align:start position:0%
wrong the 3151 is exclusive of the Ada
coordinator

05:54:46.010 --> 05:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
05:54:47.890 --> 05:54:47.900 align:start position:0%
or does that including Ada coordinate
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's exclusive exclusive so the 3151
 
05:54:55.368 --> 05:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in the 3381 in class 27
 
05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs are exclusive of ADA
 
05:54:58.980 --> 05:55:00.530 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs are exclusive of ADA
coordinator

05:55:00.530 --> 05:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
05:55:02.690 --> 05:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
they asked us to put it in our budget
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
because for their additional costs
 
05:55:05.760 --> 05:55:07.128 align:start position:0%
because for their additional costs
basically

05:55:07.128 --> 05:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:55:09.048 --> 05:55:09.058 align:start position:0%
okay but the governor didn't want to
 
05:55:11.090 --> 05:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
05:55:13.970 --> 05:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
um he he funded funded them in the
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget if I'm not yes I'm
 
05:55:18.048 --> 05:55:18.058 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's in the governor's
 
05:55:21.288 --> 05:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
recommended if I'm not mistaken okay
 
05:55:25.390 --> 05:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
but the Ada coordinator is not it is
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
asked for from him
 
05:55:39.070 --> 05:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead don't know you're right sorry
 
05:55:43.250 --> 05:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
essentially you're correct ever the APNs
 
05:55:46.128 --> 05:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
were approved by uh the governor and his
 
05:55:47.810 --> 05:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
budget director so they are in the
 
05:55:51.048 --> 05:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
I figured when we put the PowerPoint
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
together that I should break it down for
 
05:56:00.650 --> 05:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:02.810 --> 05:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
05:56:04.548 --> 05:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:56:06.048 --> 05:56:06.058 align:start position:0%
both for being here for the work you do
 
05:56:08.750 --> 05:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to and this might be
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous to make the assumption that
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
there are more federal funds out there
 
05:56:17.690 --> 05:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh for Disabilities than 164 000. does
 
05:56:19.368 --> 05:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
that get routed to Health and Human
 
05:56:21.770 --> 05:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
Services and not go through your
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
commission do you have any sort of
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
interface with Health and Human Services
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
on that just because I would imagine it
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be substantially more yeah that
 
05:56:32.208 --> 05:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
05:56:35.150 --> 05:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
um there are more funds um the funds
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
that we receive from the federal
 
05:56:39.650 --> 05:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
government uh from the rehabilitation
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
services Administration Administration
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
RSA and it's specifically for
 
05:56:47.690 --> 05:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
um the items that I spoke about
 
05:56:51.170 --> 05:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
employment so the other if there are any
 
05:56:53.208 --> 05:56:53.218 align:start position:0%
direct if there are monies for Direct
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
Services perhaps those are and I I don't
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
know assuming it goes to HHS because
 
05:57:02.690 --> 05:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're able to then put it into
 
05:57:05.090 --> 05:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
say Bureau developmental Services as an
 
05:57:08.030 --> 05:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
example over the years I've been in this
 
05:57:11.390 --> 05:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
position for a bit we we have looked at
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
federal funds because I honestly if
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're out there I'd love to apply for
 
05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
them we have over the years applied a
 
05:57:20.350 --> 05:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
couple times we've tried to bring in
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
collaborators from the state because we
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't traditionally have the incredible
 
05:57:27.250 --> 05:57:27.260 align:start position:0%
bandwidth but we have looked in the past
 
05:57:30.650 --> 05:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
for those funds so I should also say
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the silk funds are federal funds
 
05:57:35.690 --> 05:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
but they are collected from
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
right there so she so the the funds that
 
05:57:42.288 --> 05:57:42.298 align:start position:0%
come in for our part-time person we we
 
05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
build New Hampshire Department of
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
Education ultimately when you Source
 
05:57:50.570 --> 05:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
those funds those are federal to doe and
 
05:57:53.690 --> 05:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
then doe under contract with gcd
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if that helps out
 
05:58:00.650 --> 05:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.368 --> 05:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
so any other questions no
 
05:58:07.010 --> 05:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
shall we just simply approve the
 
05:58:10.730 --> 05:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in this case yeah yes
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil I just want to make
 
05:58:16.610 --> 05:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm clear the prioritized
 
05:58:18.650 --> 05:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
needs that you spelled out in this are
 
05:58:21.010 --> 05:58:21.020 align:start position:0%
included in the governor's budget
 
05:58:23.448 --> 05:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
yes why don't we double why don't we
 
05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
double check explaining what they were
 
05:58:27.410 --> 05:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so a lot of times people
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
they aren't included yeah so I I
 
05:58:33.288 --> 05:58:33.298 align:start position:0%
apologize my goal was not to confuse
 
05:58:36.170 --> 05:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's right I thought it may have
 
05:58:38.570 --> 05:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
behooved this honorable committee to
 
05:58:41.090 --> 05:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
break down what the request was so that
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
I but yes everything is included in the
 
05:58:50.208 --> 05:58:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.230 --> 05:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
governor with the efficiency budget and
 
05:58:57.890 --> 05:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
the prioritizing needs so so our
 
05:59:00.610 --> 05:59:00.620 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget was quite a bit less
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
than our Target and then with our
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs which includes the Ada
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
um the Ada coordinator it was part-time
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it was part-time
 
05:59:14.760 --> 05:59:15.590 align:start position:0%
yeah it was part-time
um

05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:17.570 --> 05:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
items listed on the next page 15.
 
05:59:21.958 --> 05:59:23.470 align:start position:0%
items listed on the next page 15.
um

05:59:23.470 --> 05:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
that made us a slightly over Target but
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
the governor ultimately approved him and
 
05:59:33.530 --> 05:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the total request of
 
05:59:37.548 --> 05:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
552 882 for fiscal year 24.
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
um that is the same amount as the
 
05:59:43.850 --> 05:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
governor's project right and just to be
 
05:59:46.910 --> 05:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
on the safe side yes yeah when I look at
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
page 15 if I may I don't mean to
 
05:59:51.410 --> 05:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
interrupt so I look at the class 50.
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
because we already have a class 50 and
 
05:59:57.048 --> 05:59:57.058 align:start position:0%
we see it at roughly 26 000 and that
 
06:00:00.890 --> 06:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
goes up to 63 024 and 25 so that's the
 
06:00:04.250 --> 06:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
Ada coordinator is in the recommended
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
but that's a great question and now's
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
the time to figure that out exactly
 
06:00:07.680 --> 06:00:08.868 align:start position:0%
the time to figure that out exactly
right

06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:00:11.690 --> 06:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
right no I agree with you all right are
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
we happy
 
06:00:15.650 --> 06:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
all right I see a lot of happy faces
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we are two more here so so Mike
 
06:00:21.410 --> 06:00:21.420 align:start position:0%

06:03:05.330 --> 06:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
present um information about the banking
 
06:03:07.250 --> 06:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
Department's budget proposal
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
so I I provided a handout for everyone
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
06:03:13.850 --> 06:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I always like to start these budget
 
06:03:16.910 --> 06:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
proposals uh discussions with a
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
statement of our mission uh whoa it is
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and I apologize
 
06:03:24.110 --> 06:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
um uh information about our mission
 
06:03:25.730 --> 06:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
statement because everything in our
 
06:03:26.810 --> 06:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
budget ties back to the mission
 
06:03:28.788 --> 06:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
statement and it is important so the
 
06:03:30.110 --> 06:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
banking department is committed to
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
protecting the Public's interests
 
06:03:33.530 --> 06:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
through the professional supervision of
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the financial services it regulates so
 
06:03:38.208 --> 06:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
what that means is we are a consumer
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
protection focused regulatory agency
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
that oversees financial institutions in
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so banks
 
06:03:47.090 --> 06:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
credit unions trust companies as well as
 
06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
a variety of licensed Consumer Financial
 
06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
Services providers such as Mortgage
 
06:03:55.128 --> 06:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
Bankers and Brokers money transmitters
 
06:03:55.138 --> 06:03:57.048 align:start position:0%
Bankers and Brokers money transmitters
Etc

06:03:57.048 --> 06:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:04:00.770 --> 06:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the budget the
 
06:04:02.510 --> 06:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
banking department is divided into two
 
06:04:05.150 --> 06:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
divisions one is the bank and trust
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
division that over that division
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
oversees the activities of 17 State
 
06:04:11.390 --> 06:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks eight credit unions and
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
42 non-depository trust companies and uh
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
private Family Trust companies the
 
06:04:19.010 --> 06:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
second division is the consumer credit
 
06:04:22.128 --> 06:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
division they oversee the uh several
 
06:04:24.410 --> 06:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
thousand Consumer Credit licensees so
 
06:04:26.030 --> 06:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
again the Mortgage Bankers the mortgage
 
06:04:29.330 --> 06:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
brokers servicers uh small loan lenders
 
06:04:32.090 --> 06:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
money transmitters when you hear Money
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
transmitters you think may be Western
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
Union but it also comprises a growing
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
fintech industry so that's where we do
 
06:04:41.390 --> 06:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a touch on
 
06:04:42.890 --> 06:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency that you might hear in
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the news and that sort of emerging
 
06:04:48.590 --> 06:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
emerging technology division
 
06:04:50.570 --> 06:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so those are our two divisions for
 
06:04:52.730 --> 06:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the budget
 
06:04:54.650 --> 06:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
um the banking department has 48
 
06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
positions right now we have one position
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's actively being recruited to fill
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
one vacant position that's in the
 
06:05:03.048 --> 06:05:03.058 align:start position:0%
process of being reclassified and two
 
06:05:05.510 --> 06:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
vacant funded positions
 
06:05:08.570 --> 06:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
so let's see the banking department is a
 
06:05:11.090 --> 06:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency we are 100 other
 
06:05:13.490 --> 06:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
funds what that means in Practical terms
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
is at the start of the fiscal year we
 
06:05:17.208 --> 06:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
receive an appropriation from the
 
06:05:19.250 --> 06:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
legislature and the state treasurer via
 
06:05:20.810 --> 06:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer
 
06:05:22.970 --> 06:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
um and over the course of the year we
 
06:05:25.970 --> 06:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
charge fees fines and at the end of the
 
06:05:27.530 --> 06:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
year an assessment on all of our
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
regulated entities to basically recruit
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
recoup that appropriation so at the end
 
06:05:34.250 --> 06:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the year we net nothing to the
 
06:05:36.010 --> 06:05:36.020 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
06:05:39.170 --> 06:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh so in in effect we're right we're
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
funded completely by the private
 
06:05:43.128 --> 06:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
businesses that we regulate
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
um so moving right along
 
06:05:47.810 --> 06:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
sorry do you have a question okay all
 
06:05:47.820 --> 06:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
sorry do you have a question okay all
right

06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:53.040 --> 06:05:55.850 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:05:55.850 --> 06:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.410 --> 06:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
I don't I was gonna say I don't have a
 
06:06:00.470 --> 06:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so I apologize
 
06:06:00.480 --> 06:06:03.048 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so I apologize
okay

06:06:03.048 --> 06:06:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.058 --> 06:06:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.080 --> 06:06:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:06:09.788 --> 06:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
okay okay okay
 
06:06:12.830 --> 06:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna keep going
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
um so I would direct your attention to
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the handout for kind of a high level
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
report of the amounts we've requested in
 
06:06:22.670 --> 06:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
our budget I won't belabor them
 
06:06:25.250 --> 06:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
um there I'm in your handout but this is
 
06:06:27.170 --> 06:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
just a summary really
 
06:06:30.410 --> 06:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
um 80 of the banking 80 to 85 actually
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the banking Department's budget is um
 
06:06:34.610 --> 06:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits so we are
 
06:06:36.410 --> 06:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
primarily people
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
um we have I.T equipment that supports
 
06:06:40.490 --> 06:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
those people but for the most part all
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
people we don't have any equipment or
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
06:06:46.670 --> 06:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so flipping to the back of the
 
06:06:46.680 --> 06:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
um so flipping to the back of the
handout

06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
handout
 
06:06:49.730 --> 06:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
um the banking department has been
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
tasked by the legislature with
 
06:06:53.930 --> 06:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
regulating a vibrant and ever growing
 
06:06:56.090 --> 06:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
number of licensed entities again
 
06:06:57.770 --> 06:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
largely those are the fintech companies
 
06:06:59.208 --> 06:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
at the top you can see the steady
 
06:06:59.218 --> 06:07:00.890 align:start position:0%
at the top you can see the steady
increase

06:07:00.890 --> 06:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:07:03.230 --> 06:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and then non-depository trust
 
06:07:05.390 --> 06:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
companies there's been a process ongoing
 
06:07:08.570 --> 06:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 to 15 probably longer
 
06:07:10.128 --> 06:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
than that years I've been at the bank
 
06:07:11.868 --> 06:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
Department 11 and it's been going on the
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
whole time I've been here
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
um process of modernizing our trust
 
06:07:17.690 --> 06:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
company laws to attract that business to
 
06:07:19.910 --> 06:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so as a
 
06:07:22.368 --> 06:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
result the bottom chart shows the growth
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
in those industries that are those
 
06:07:26.090 --> 06:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
companies that are regulated by the
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
banking department and kind of shows the
 
06:07:30.770 --> 06:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
progression of examiners that we
 
06:07:33.230 --> 06:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing to cope with that
 
06:07:33.240 --> 06:07:34.628 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing to cope with that
increase

06:07:34.628 --> 06:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:07:37.250 --> 06:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
in past budget Cycles we've been able to
 
06:07:41.628 --> 06:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
absorb this growth by leveraging by for
 
06:07:43.570 --> 06:07:43.580 align:start position:0%
example One Way leveraging information
 
06:07:47.570 --> 06:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
Technologies and by making good use of
 
06:07:49.610 --> 06:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
our existing positions we've been very
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
fortunate we have been lucky in filling
 
06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
our positions
 
06:07:56.750 --> 06:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so we we've been making good use of
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
all the positions we have however the
 
06:08:01.128 --> 06:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
industry growth as you can see from this
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
chart is now beginning to outpace our
 
06:08:06.890 --> 06:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
staff basically we are tasked with going
 
06:08:08.750 --> 06:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
out into the field and examining all the
 
06:08:10.730 --> 06:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
entities that are regulated by us on a
 
06:08:13.368 --> 06:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
for trust companies for example it's
 
06:08:15.230 --> 06:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
every 18 months it's different time
 
06:08:17.390 --> 06:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
periods for different entities but
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we're we're basically
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
right now the growth is outpacing the
 
06:08:24.650 --> 06:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
number of examiners we have
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
um and that is becoming a problem for us
 
06:08:26.638 --> 06:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
um and that is becoming a problem for us
so

06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:30.830 --> 06:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
um for this reason in this budget we've
 
06:08:32.810 --> 06:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
made a targeted and strategic request
 
06:08:35.410 --> 06:08:35.420 align:start position:0%
for two new positions in fiscal year 24
 
06:08:38.208 --> 06:08:38.218 align:start position:0%
and three new positions in fiscal year
 
06:08:41.330 --> 06:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
25 and then outside of the budget we're
 
06:08:43.730 --> 06:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
going to take three existing positions
 
06:08:46.610 --> 06:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
and reclassify them reallocate them to
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
best suit our needs to cut to regulate
 
06:08:51.250 --> 06:08:51.260 align:start position:0%
that growing industry
 
06:08:54.288 --> 06:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
the net result of all these moving
 
06:08:56.448 --> 06:08:56.458 align:start position:0%
positions will be that we're going to
 
06:08:59.690 --> 06:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
add a deputy director to both the
 
06:09:01.788 --> 06:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
consumer credit Division and the
 
06:09:03.530 --> 06:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
division that regulates the trust
 
06:09:05.330 --> 06:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
companies and then we're going to add a
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
couple of examiners as well as a legal
 
06:09:10.250 --> 06:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
person an attorney because
 
06:09:12.770 --> 06:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
um as these entities come in they submit
 
06:09:15.410 --> 06:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
these very um
 
06:09:18.670 --> 06:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
technology driven and complicated
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
applications for licensure and it's
 
06:09:22.490 --> 06:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
important that we have legal staff that
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
can review them so um basically at the
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
end of the day the goal accomplished by
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
our budget proposal is to provide the
 
06:09:31.430 --> 06:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
banking Department with adequate
 
06:09:33.530 --> 06:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
experience and professional staff to
 
06:09:35.330 --> 06:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
cope with the extraordinary growth we've
 
06:09:36.890 --> 06:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
been experiencing in the fintech
 
06:09:39.770 --> 06:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
emerging fintech companies as well as
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
the exponential increase in trust
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
companies in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
so in summary that's my our budget
 
06:09:48.350 --> 06:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
presentation it's all about people and
 
06:09:50.448 --> 06:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
Staffing on getting the adequate staff
 
06:09:53.150 --> 06:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
that we need and I'm happy to answer any
 
06:09:55.070 --> 06:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
all right representative evil
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
very basic Define fintech
 
06:10:03.170 --> 06:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's not a very basic question
 
06:10:06.530 --> 06:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
surprisingly it depends on who you ask
 
06:10:08.090 --> 06:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking when we say
 
06:10:10.128 --> 06:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
fintech we're thinking of companies that
 
06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
use technology to deliver Financial
 
06:10:12.360 --> 06:10:13.610 align:start position:0%
use technology to deliver Financial
Services

06:10:13.610 --> 06:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
Services
 
06:10:16.670 --> 06:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
so for example we regulate PayPal when
 
06:10:18.590 --> 06:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
you go and like make a purchase on
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
somebody and select I want to pay with
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
PayPal we will go in and examine that
 
06:10:24.770 --> 06:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
transaction make sure they're complying
 
06:10:27.048 --> 06:10:27.058 align:start position:0%
with rules and laws that's generally how
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
we think about fintech different people
 
06:10:30.170 --> 06:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
could Define it slightly differently
 
06:10:30.180 --> 06:10:31.548 align:start position:0%
could Define it slightly differently
though

06:10:31.548 --> 06:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
though
 
06:10:33.890 --> 06:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
than most regulated by us they're a part
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
of PayPal
 
06:10:38.448 --> 06:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you the
 
06:10:40.190 --> 06:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
product of PayPal on that same line
 
06:10:42.730 --> 06:10:42.740 align:start position:0%
would like coinbase
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so crypto is a little bit more
 
06:10:45.840 --> 06:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
okay so crypto is a little bit more
nuanced

06:10:46.970 --> 06:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
nuanced
 
06:10:46.980 --> 06:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
nuanced
um

06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:49.850 --> 06:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
for example FTX who you've probably
 
06:10:51.410 --> 06:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
heard about in the news
 
06:10:54.590 --> 06:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
um they um they held a license with us
 
06:10:57.048 --> 06:10:57.058 align:start position:0%
as a money transmitter however
 
06:10:59.570 --> 06:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
um with cryptocurrency we only regulate
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
a very narrow portion of that market so
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature limited our jurisdiction
 
06:11:07.128 --> 06:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
to only companies or transactions where
 
06:11:09.770 --> 06:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
say the company took your cryptocurrency
 
06:11:13.010 --> 06:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
and gave him fiat currency that's the
 
06:11:15.048 --> 06:11:15.058 align:start position:0%
transactions we regulate if the company
 
06:11:16.850 --> 06:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
takes your cryptocurrency and gives him
 
06:11:18.890 --> 06:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency we don't regulate that
 
06:11:21.230 --> 06:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
transaction so it's really a very narrow
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
portion of that particular industry that
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
we regulate
 
06:11:28.368 --> 06:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so is there really two trillion
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
dollars somewhere in New Hampshire
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's what this page says oh
 
06:11:38.690 --> 06:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
I couldn't speak to that
 
06:11:42.288 --> 06:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
a AUA of public Trust Company billions
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
of dollars so it's actually trillion yep
 
06:11:46.368 --> 06:11:46.378 align:start position:0%
so those companies do not have to be
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire
 
06:11:49.788 --> 06:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
so they're located actually all over the
 
06:11:49.798 --> 06:11:50.690 align:start position:0%
so they're located actually all over the
world

06:11:50.690 --> 06:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
world
 
06:11:52.490 --> 06:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
um we do have a company that has
 
06:11:54.770 --> 06:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
operations in the UK
 
06:11:56.690 --> 06:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the biggest company that we have is
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
Raymond James I believe they are out of
 
06:12:01.010 --> 06:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
Florida I could be wrong about that
 
06:12:02.990 --> 06:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't quote me but we that they don't
 
06:12:04.610 --> 06:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
have to be located in New Hampshire to
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
be a Trust Company
 
06:12:09.170 --> 06:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
but they contribute fees to your
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
department to our department yes they
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
take part in the assessment we examine
 
06:12:15.708 --> 06:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
them we charge them fees for that
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
examination to the extent there was any
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
issue we would they would be subject to
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
our finding Authority does that mean you
 
06:12:23.330 --> 06:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
go to Florida I don't personally go
 
06:12:23.340 --> 06:12:24.530 align:start position:0%
go to Florida I don't personally go
anywhere

06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
06:12:24.540 --> 06:12:26.048 align:start position:0%
anywhere
um

06:12:26.048 --> 06:12:26.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
so we actually
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic we found that we
 
06:12:33.288 --> 06:12:33.298 align:start position:0%
could do efficient exams remotely so
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
we've mostly been doing our exams
 
06:12:37.250 --> 06:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
remotely with a very limited on-site
 
06:12:39.470 --> 06:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
visit just to make sure that everything
 
06:12:42.170 --> 06:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
is as they say it is however for the
 
06:12:44.208 --> 06:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
most part all these companies are
 
06:12:46.730 --> 06:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
operating remotely so it's just as
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
efficient for us to um
 
06:12:51.170 --> 06:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
do our examinations remotely for the
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
most part with some limited
 
06:12:56.208 --> 06:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
if you find problems
 
06:12:58.190 --> 06:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
does it become a matter for the Attorney
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
General no we have our own enforcement
 
06:13:03.170 --> 06:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
Division I it could potentially it sort
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
of it depends
 
06:13:06.350 --> 06:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
um entities that are subject to our
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction are exempt from the
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act so they come
 
06:13:11.330 --> 06:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
they come under our jurisdiction for
 
06:13:13.128 --> 06:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
enforcing unfair and deceptive trades
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and practices or any violation of our
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
statutes that we have jurisdiction over
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
um so for the most part it's under us
 
06:13:21.890 --> 06:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
but there could potentially be some
 
06:13:21.900 --> 06:13:23.390 align:start position:0%
but there could potentially be some
crossover

06:13:23.390 --> 06:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
crossover
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
um for example you know one of our
 
06:13:28.010 --> 06:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
license types is retail sellers which
 
06:13:30.288 --> 06:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
are auto dealers who arrange financing
 
06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
but obviously auto dealers take part in
 
06:13:35.330 --> 06:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
a wide range of activities outside of
 
06:13:37.788 --> 06:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
arranging financing so there tends to be
 
06:13:40.490 --> 06:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
some cross crossover there you know
 
06:13:41.868 --> 06:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
we'll get a Consumer complaint for
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
example that says a lot of things and
 
06:13:45.650 --> 06:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
only a piece of it's ours but some of
 
06:13:46.850 --> 06:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's theirs
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
06:13:48.840 --> 06:13:50.410 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
so

06:13:50.410 --> 06:13:50.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:53.930 --> 06:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
how often do you find the problems all
 
06:13:57.770 --> 06:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
the time hardly ever so our um we have
 
06:14:00.530 --> 06:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
strict confidentiality laws our reports
 
06:14:02.150 --> 06:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
of examination investigations and
 
06:14:04.970 --> 06:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints are confidential
 
06:14:07.970 --> 06:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
um by Statute however if we take an
 
06:14:09.410 --> 06:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that is a public
 
06:14:11.030 --> 06:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
action and those are listed on our
 
06:14:11.040 --> 06:14:12.110 align:start position:0%
action and those are listed on our
website

06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
website
 
06:14:13.788 --> 06:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
um and we just revamped our website so
 
06:14:15.470 --> 06:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's actually quite easy to navigate you
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
can sort it by the most recent
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions and see what what
 
06:14:21.650 --> 06:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
has been happening recently but is it
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
one a week is it enforcement actions
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
and So lately we had um
 
06:14:31.368 --> 06:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
had a change in how we license for
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
example auto dealers we um switched them
 
06:14:35.570 --> 06:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
so they have to be licensed through the
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
Nationwide multi-state licensing system
 
06:14:40.190 --> 06:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
we gained a lot of efficiencies that way
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
however there were some like hiccups and
 
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting people onto the system so we had
 
06:14:46.490 --> 06:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
to enter into some consent orders for
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
people who had technology issues getting
 
06:14:50.690 --> 06:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
onto the system so we basically license
 
06:14:52.430 --> 06:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
them by consent while they worked out
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
those issues so like if you went on our
 
06:14:58.010 --> 06:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
and yes representative evil
 
06:15:05.448 --> 06:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:10.250 --> 06:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:10.260 --> 06:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
thing

06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:15:11.040 --> 06:15:17.208 align:start position:0%
thing
um

06:15:17.208 --> 06:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:19.010 --> 06:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
two thousands
 
06:15:20.930 --> 06:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
um they sort of go in there's two parts
 
06:15:23.810 --> 06:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
of them one is the modernization of the
 
06:15:25.490 --> 06:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
Cross mode which really is a member of
 
06:15:27.170 --> 06:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction
 
06:15:29.390 --> 06:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
what does that mean though have I not
 
06:15:30.948 --> 06:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
had this on the whole time I apologize
 
06:15:32.448 --> 06:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay
 
06:15:33.650 --> 06:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so one part is the modernization of
 
06:15:37.490 --> 06:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
the trust code which governs how estate
 
06:15:39.650 --> 06:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
planning happens that's really outside
 
06:15:41.810 --> 06:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
of our jurisdiction but I think it has
 
06:15:43.730 --> 06:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
made New Hampshire a more attractive
 
06:15:46.090 --> 06:15:46.100 align:start position:0%
state for trust companies to come into
 
06:15:49.850 --> 06:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
in part to um to make to basically
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
capitalize on those changes and then um
 
06:15:56.030 --> 06:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
most recently in 2015 we had a large
 
06:15:58.490 --> 06:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
recodification effort of our trust
 
06:16:00.470 --> 06:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
company banking statutes and Credit
 
06:16:02.810 --> 06:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
Union statutes that really um
 
06:16:06.170 --> 06:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
streamlined our statutes made us um I
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
think very easy to navigate in terms of
 
06:16:09.770 --> 06:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
our laws as compared to other states
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
with a similar Trust Company Authority
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I think those those two things
 
06:16:18.530 --> 06:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
working together have really um made us
 
06:16:22.250 --> 06:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh attractive place to get a charter for
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:28.250 --> 06:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin thank you Mr
 
06:16:31.610 --> 06:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
06:16:33.470 --> 06:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
um does your department have any
 
06:16:33.480 --> 06:16:34.788 align:start position:0%
um does your department have any
exposure

06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
in other words if you examine a trust
 
06:16:41.570 --> 06:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
company or something and later on there
 
06:16:43.490 --> 06:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
is a problem with it is there any
 
06:16:45.770 --> 06:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
exposure to your department
 
06:16:49.610 --> 06:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
you mean like legal exposure or
 
06:16:53.030 --> 06:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah like legal exposure from like a
 
06:16:57.410 --> 06:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
consumer perspective or yes okay
 
06:16:57.420 --> 06:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
consumer perspective or yes okay
um

06:16:58.070 --> 06:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:58.080 --> 06:16:59.448 align:start position:0%
um
hmm

06:16:59.448 --> 06:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
06:17:01.190 --> 06:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's a legal exposure I think that would
 
06:17:03.650 --> 06:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
be a question for the doj
 
06:17:05.810 --> 06:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
um we are a division of state government
 
06:17:08.390 --> 06:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
and there is like and I'm not an expert
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
so this is probably outside I am a
 
06:17:11.150 --> 06:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer but this is not my field of
 
06:17:13.250 --> 06:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
expertise but there is like sovereign
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
immunity and different things that would
 
06:17:17.930 --> 06:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
I think protect the state
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:17:20.690 --> 06:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's right you're
 
06:17:22.010 --> 06:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
getting at it it might not be the best
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
person to answer that I suspect the
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
answer is no because if you if you had
 
06:17:30.230 --> 06:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
three or four lawsuits against you you'd
 
06:17:31.730 --> 06:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
probably be aware of it I would be aware
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
of that yes if we did have three or four
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against me yes I would know
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
that and I was General Counsel at the
 
06:17:38.270 --> 06:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
banking Department um before I became
 
06:17:40.490 --> 06:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
deputy and then commissioner so yes I
 
06:17:43.250 --> 06:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
would be aware of that
 
06:17:47.810 --> 06:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
the questions anyone yes representative
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
I mean would you anticipate the number
 
06:17:53.770 --> 06:17:53.780 align:start position:0%
of public trust companies to increase
 
06:17:56.930 --> 06:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
yes so um if you look at this chart um
 
06:17:59.090 --> 06:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh my director of trust supervision
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
Nancy Daigle Bernard she's very good at
 
06:18:03.048 --> 06:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
predicting kind of where we're going
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
she's been at the department for 30
 
06:18:08.208 --> 06:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
years 29 years 29 or 30 years she's
 
06:18:09.590 --> 06:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
pretty good at this
 
06:18:11.810 --> 06:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
um and what I know we've seen since I've
 
06:18:13.250 --> 06:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
been general counsel since that
 
06:18:16.250 --> 06:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
recodification effort is about three to
 
06:18:18.350 --> 06:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
four one time I think we had five new
 
06:18:19.788 --> 06:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
ones in a year
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so it has become pretty predictable
 
06:18:24.830 --> 06:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
right now um we had we did have exactly
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
42 in fiscal year 22 and right now we
 
06:18:30.170 --> 06:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
have exactly three in the hopper
 
06:18:33.830 --> 06:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think we'll probably hit 45 by
 
06:18:35.628 --> 06:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year the end of fiscal year
 
06:18:35.638 --> 06:18:36.948 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year the end of fiscal year
23.

06:18:36.948 --> 06:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
23.
 
06:18:39.770 --> 06:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
so are are these existing companies that
 
06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
are moving do you do you see are they
 
06:18:43.610 --> 06:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
new companies that are being formed it's
 
06:18:44.448 --> 06:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
a mix
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I'd say
 
06:18:48.770 --> 06:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
out of four you know
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
two of them might be new two of them
 
06:18:52.730 --> 06:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
might be moving
 
06:18:54.470 --> 06:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
um two of them might be you know
 
06:18:56.330 --> 06:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're existing companies but
 
06:18:57.770 --> 06:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
they're moving into a new business model
 
06:18:59.270 --> 06:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
where they want to make use of a trust
 
06:19:01.490 --> 06:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
company charter it really
 
06:19:05.628 --> 06:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:08.208 --> 06:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
what fraction of banks are nationally
 
06:19:11.510 --> 06:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
chartered versus State China oh that's
 
06:19:14.990 --> 06:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
that's in New Hampshire I don't know the
 
06:19:19.070 --> 06:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
exact number of nationally chartered
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
Banks because they're not under my
 
06:19:22.970 --> 06:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but I could look that up
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
for you on the FDIC website I think they
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
can sort them by state to tell you who
 
06:19:28.850 --> 06:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
has offices in New Hampshire for
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
nationally chartered they just generally
 
06:19:33.948 --> 06:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
measured by number of branches or is it
 
06:19:36.110 --> 06:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
number assets or something you could
 
06:19:38.030 --> 06:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
probably sort it both ways
 
06:19:40.850 --> 06:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
um so yeah because I would I would I
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
guess I would think that
 
06:19:45.110 --> 06:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
if if something's State chartered then
 
06:19:47.208 --> 06:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
it can only be in New Hampshire or it
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
could have branches elsewhere it could
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:55.610 --> 06:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
es so in some ways are we competing with
 
06:19:55.620 --> 06:19:57.048 align:start position:0%
es so in some ways are we competing with
Federal

06:19:57.048 --> 06:19:57.058 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
06:19:59.570 --> 06:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
um Charters I mean is there something
 
06:20:02.570 --> 06:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
yeah if we want more Banks to be New
 
06:20:04.610 --> 06:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chartered like yeah I think to
 
06:20:06.410 --> 06:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
be like the Delaware of banks or
 
06:20:09.048 --> 06:20:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.390 --> 06:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so I so to be fair the 2015
 
06:20:14.270 --> 06:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
recodification effort did revamp our
 
06:20:16.190 --> 06:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
banking laws as well and in my opinion
 
06:20:17.810 --> 06:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
is the lawyer who mostly had to look at
 
06:20:20.090 --> 06:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
those laws made them so much easier to
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
read so to the extent that um that
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
process has already been undertaken I
 
06:20:26.330 --> 06:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
think we've made good progress in that
 
06:20:26.340 --> 06:20:27.410 align:start position:0%
think we've made good progress in that
direction

06:20:27.410 --> 06:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
direction
 
06:20:31.070 --> 06:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions nope all
 
06:20:31.080 --> 06:20:32.208 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions nope all
right

06:20:32.208 --> 06:20:32.218 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:20:34.010 --> 06:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
don't see that we have any problems with
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
this area no so we're all set all right
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so we'll see you all
 
06:20:40.970 --> 06:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at
 
06:20:44.750 --> 06:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
is it 9 30 or 10 I'm not sure
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:52.868 --> 06:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
is it are we in the big room
 
06:20:56.330 --> 06:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's a work session here we're here well
 
06:21:55.250 --> 06:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
