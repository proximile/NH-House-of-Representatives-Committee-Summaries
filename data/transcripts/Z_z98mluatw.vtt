it gives us an opportunity to find out
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
where we stand relative to our revenues
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
so today will be primarily focused
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
by the agencies coming in to

you
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
so today i'll be very quick kind of a
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
high level where we are
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
just a little background the last budget
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
for the 22 and 23 biennium was passed on
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
june 17th of last year
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
when we developed the budget it's the
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year the odd number fiscal year
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
so 21 and then projections for 22 and 23
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that's really where
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.469 align:start position:0%
ways and means
does

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
play a large role in developing the
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
budget for the next biennium
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're six months into an 18-month budget
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
so it's still very early as far as the
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
current biennium for fy 22 and 23.
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
what has occurred in december the
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
annual comprehensive financial report
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
which is the state this financial
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
snapshot of state was finalized and we
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
got a real sense of how did fy21
 
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.150 align:start position:0%
got a real sense of how did fy21
end

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
just to tell you kind of what happened
 
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.629 align:start position:0%
just to tell you kind of what happened
is

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee our office will
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
work with the ways and means committee
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
to help develop throughout the session
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
to help develop revenue estimates you'll
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
have the agencies in as well but
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times during the session the
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
ways means committee will be looking at
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
the various revenue sources be it
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
business taxes meals and rooms
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
just to get us to sense to the budget
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
writers in the finance committee on how
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
they can build their budget
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
so that's a very active process through
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
that budget process
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
we go to the finance committee who stay
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
within those
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
parameters provided by the ways means
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee that's historically what has
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
happened ways mean provides an estimate
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee who then
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
develops their budget based on that
 
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.629 align:start position:0%
develops their budget based on that
estimate

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are then policy changes tax policy
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
changes are made during the budget
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
usually in coordination and consultation
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
or discussion with ways means to some of
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
those taxes which are then reflected on
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement that our office
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
presents so we have our base revenues
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
provided by the house ways and means
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee and then we have our final
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
that are provided both ways and means
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
and the policy passed by the legislature
 
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
and the policy passed by the legislature
21

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
good year as far as the general and
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is concerned um
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
left when we left on june 17th when the
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
the final budget was uh adopted
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
it was assumed that the rainy day fund
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
would have a balance of about 121.9
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars at the end of fiscal
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
year 21.
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
at the time the rainy day fund was
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
sitting at about 115 so it was about a
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
six million dollar deposit into the
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund at the end of 21.
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
within those two weeks as things have
 
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.909 align:start position:0%
within those two weeks as things have
changed

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
when the final kafir came out even
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
preliminary revenues revenues were
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
almost 90 million dollars up from where
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
the budget writers thought would be when
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
they had ended their budget discussions
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
on top of that the agency lapse was
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
almost over 70 million what the budget
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
writers had assumed in fiscal year 21
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year that they were actually
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then a couple other adjustments uh
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
with some accounting
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
the state actually ended up transferring
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
over almost
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
130 plus million dollars into the rainy
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
day fund so instead of
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
121.9 as estimated by
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
the budget writers at the time the rainy
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
day fund based on the most recent kaffir
 
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
that was released sits at
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
257.8 million dollars so significantly
 
00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:31.909 align:start position:0%
257.8 million dollars so significantly
above

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
where the budget writers and the
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee thought would be at the end of
 
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
committee thought would be at the end of
june

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
so what i have before you here you'll
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
have a snapshot so snapshot is kind of
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
just a point in time look uh based on
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
what we know
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
the current budget year
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
is how that is trending
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
we know so we'll have two columns here
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
we have 22 we have the budget which is
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
shaded out so you can see what the
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
budget writers had assumed and i'll go
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
over those very quickly
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
budget writers had assumed 5.5 million
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
dollars would carry forward it from 21
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
to 22 and that is the education trust
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
fund because the education trust is
 
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.470 align:start position:0%
fund because the education trust is
non-lapsing

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
revenue was estimated at about
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
272 billion 798 million dollars
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
budget appropriations after lapses at
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
about 2.687 billion current balance
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
about 111 with cumulative ending balance
 
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.910 align:start position:0%
about 111 with cumulative ending balance
of

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
117.4 million between both education and
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
there would then be at the end of 22 or
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
during 22 a transfer of 50 million into
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
to help shore up the highway fund due to
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
the decline in revenues
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
also so that would end the cumulative
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
ending balance
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
67.4 million dollars was what budget
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
writers had assumed
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
of that 13 million would be the general
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
fund which in the even number year
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
carries forward into 23 and 54.4 million
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
dollars into the education trust fund
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
no change in the
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
121.9 that's what the budget writers had
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
assumed so for 22 there's no transfer
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day fund from revenues or
 
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day fund from revenues or
expenditures

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
they do receive small amounts from any
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
settlement that the ag receives they
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
receive the first if it's over a million
 
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
receive the first if it's over a million
dollars

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
they'll receive the first 10 percent so
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
there will be a couple hundred thousand
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
here and there usually in the
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
even-numbered year that will be
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
transferred into the rainy day fund
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
so that's where the budget
 
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.150 align:start position:0%
so that's where the budget
had

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
had
had

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
was projected at 22.
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
on row 2 under the preliminary you can
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
see the beginning balance coming forward
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
was not 5.5 it was 2.2 and that that's
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
basically indicating that the education
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
trust fund balance forward was about 3.3
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
million less than anticipated
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
estimated revenue
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
is the same on row five but the
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
year-to-date variance this is just
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
through december was 129 million dollars
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
over plan for both funds
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
and of that 129 million uh all but about
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
600 000 or so was general fund just
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
because a lot of in dra will be here
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
later talking about the business taxes
 
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
later talking about the business taxes
but

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax is performing
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
the bet which has a larger impact on the
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
education trust fund based on the
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
statutory split
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
is not as high as the bpt and so what
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
happens is that the general fund is
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
benefiting so far
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the largest beneficiary from the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
additional revenue
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i would just caution that we are
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
only halfway this is only halfway
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal year march and april
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
are big months
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
over a quarter of your revenue is coming
 
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
over a quarter of your revenue is coming
in

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
in march and april so that's when a lot
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the returns are done the final tax
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
filings are due and lin commissioner
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
stepp can talk about this during her
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
presentation but there's still
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
there are still fluctuations that can
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
occur in march and april in addition
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
june is also a very big month for
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
business taxes and so even though you
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
are 129 million dollars above plan
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
through december i would just caution
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
that march april and june or very large
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
months for revenue collection and that's
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
really what weighs means we'll be
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring throughout the next couple of
 
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.910 align:start position:0%
monitoring throughout the next couple of
months

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
how does january end
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
february is a small month but how does
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
march end in april and so that's what
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
the communities will be working on
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
as far as budget appropriations
 
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
as far as budget appropriations
2

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
billion 751.8 million dollars
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
we do that is what the budget writers
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
had assumed and that's all your house
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill one appropriations which are your
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
standard appropriations in the big 800
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
800 page document as well as house bill
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
2 individual appropriations which is the
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
so where finance comes in
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
and fiscal committee comes in there are
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
also unbudgeted appropriations that
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
budget writers are not
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
they do not project
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
during the budget process they're
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
typically in a normal year i say a
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
normal year hasn't been like that for a
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
while but
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
between eight to twelve million dollars
 
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
between eight to twelve million dollars
of

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
statutory appropriation things like
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
workers comp claims abandoned property
 
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
workers comp claims abandoned property
claims

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
legal settlements
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
judicial council funds additional funds
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
that come through the fiscal committee
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
litigation funds that the the
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
attorney general comes through fiscal
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee for additional
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
but we can see that just through
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
december on row 11
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
25.7 million dollars of unbudgeted
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
appropriations so yes the
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
revenues are doing well
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
but you also do have to continue and we
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
will continue to monitor the unbudgeted
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
appropriations so that's 25.7 million
 
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.430 align:start position:0%
appropriations so that's 25.7 million
dollars

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.790 align:start position:0%
dollars
now

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
of that amount
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
almost 10 million dollars of that is
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
education trust me related from two
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
two areas one is about eight million
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in the education freedom
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
accounts which is a direct draw on the
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and another two
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
point four million dollars is additional
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
inadequacy grants over budget based on
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
the actual student accounts
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining money is general
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
funds and about 10 million of that not
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
10 million about 5 million of that is
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
related to the department of justice who
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
has requested through fiscal two
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
requests for additional general funds
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
appropriations for litigation there is a
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
lot of litigation outstanding that the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general is involved in when
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
they do need outside help they do come
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal committee for general
 
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.269 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal committee for general
fund

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
authority typically budget had about 350
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
000 a year the fiscal committee is used
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general coming back in
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
usually in the 2 million range but we
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
know through december so far you're over
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
5 million dollars just from that one
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
that one department
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh estimated laps very what the lapse is
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
is basically your unexpended
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
appropriations so you know with an
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
18-month budget there these are their
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
projections revenues projection spending
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
of projections so lapses occur when if
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
positions are assumed to be filled for
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
the entire 18 months but are really only
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
filled for you know 12 out of those 18
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
months it will result in unexpended
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
appropriations and that will so collapse
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
to the general
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
fund so right now if we were to stop
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
today and this isn't even taking into
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
account the revenue i think revenue and
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
lindsay can talk about that uh revenue
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
through january is also above plan so
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that 129 million dollar figure will
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
probably be up by the time the monthly
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
revenue focus comes in at the end of
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
january uh so the number could bump up
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
but just based on december what we
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
actually know
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
current year balance about 215.2 million
 
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.710 align:start position:0%
current year balance about 215.2 million
dollars

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the cumulative ending balance at
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
about 217.4
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that's basically your preliminary
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
your beginning balance plus your uh
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
current year balance
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
so compared to the budget on row 17
 
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
so compared to the budget on row 17
there's

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
roughly these are all rounded it just
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
worked out perfectly but it's about a
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollar difference
 
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollar difference
above

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
a positive above
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
where the budget writers thought the
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
ending balance would be in both those
 
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.069 align:start position:0%
ending balance would be in both those
funds

00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
the transfer to the highway fund is the
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
same so on row 22 the 167.4
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
after the transfer to the highway fund
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
and 22 compared to the 67.4
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
where the finance committee and where
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee will
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
continue to work is based on is on the
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
split between the education trust fund
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the general fund
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
because as you can see of the
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar difference if you
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
look on row 23 the general fund share of
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
that is almost
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
113 so
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
even though there's only 100 million
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
dollars the general fund is still
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
benefiting by about 113 million dollars
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
year-to-date what that means is that on
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
road 24 you are trending below in the
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund instead of 54.4
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars which was the assumed
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
ending balance in 22 year-to-date you're
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
at about 40.6 so that's almost a 13
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
almost 14 million dollar um
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
variance negative variance in the
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund again there will be a
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
couple thousand hundred thousand dollars
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
here and there but shouldn't change much
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the uh current year uh because it is
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
an even number year in any transfer in
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
the rainy day from the general fund
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
surplus will happen at the end of the
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
biennium in 23.
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then what i have on beginning on row
 
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.590 align:start position:0%
and then what i have on beginning on row
29

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
29
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
is your watch list and this is something
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
that both committees as well as our
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
office and the agencies will watch
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
obviously row 30 revenue versus plan
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay attention to what
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
happens in january february but
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
especially march and april
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted appropriations typically
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
you may see another 10 million dollars
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
come through either not necessarily
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
through fiscal committee but things like
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
your abandoned property claims that
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
happen near the end of the fiscal year
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
workers comp etcetera
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
it could be 10 plus or minus probably on
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
rose 32 and 33 are really your senate
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
financing your ways and means committee
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
um these are what you'll be these are
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
basically a priority to pay attention to
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
as you know as second committees you
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
monitor the policy bills that passes the
 
00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:27.190 align:start position:0%
monitor the policy bills that passes the
legislature

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
be it a revenue impact or an
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation impact
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
because since the budget was passed six
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
months ago you do still want to maintain
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
a balanced budget throughout
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
on row 32 the legislative specials which
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
are all the the bills that have been
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
filed with appropriations or open
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
warrant authorities be it retirement
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
education trust fund um
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars for ydc
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
settlement based on those that
 
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
settlement based on those that
litigation

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
totals almost 400 million so about 390
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
million of bills are out there now not
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
all of these bills will pass there's
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
some you know can be some crossover
 
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
some you know can be some crossover
between

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
but that is something that the finance
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee continues to monitor as those
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
bills pass the policy committees what
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
are the bills that are on both sides
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
house and senate what are the bills that
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
are still alive what is the obligation
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
and then that's why our office is
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
involved with both the house and senate
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
finance committees to continuously
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
update them on the status of those
 
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
update them on the status of those
appropriations

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
and in row 33 legislative specialist of
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
revenue impact
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
revenue is very indeterminable but you
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
know just on what was provided on the
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes there are revenue bills
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
that could be 125 million plus
 
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
that could be 125 million plus
um

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
negative draw on revenues based on the
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
bills that are there and obviously ways
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
and means will be monitoring each bill
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
as it comes through your committee
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
as that goes through and we'll be
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
providing updates on what bills are
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
still alive as we go through the session
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
and again we are still only six months
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
into an 18 into a 24 month budget so we
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
still have a lot of time left
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then on row 34 is litigation this is
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's to be determined
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you look into the annual
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report there's
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
usually a litigation section and what
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
this does is point out those cases that
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
could have a material
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
potentially large impact on the state's
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
balance sheet
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
there are over 18 cases that were listed
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
this year in 21
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
large items i think the largest one
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
you've probably all been hearing about
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
and reading about is the sununu center
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
the youth development center
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
obviously 100 of that 390 million
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation is supposed is to put in
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
the fund to use a separate process to
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
fund that
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
fund that
but

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
that will take care of under 100 of
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
those cases and i think there are a few
 
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.390 align:start position:0%
those cases and i think there are a few
hundred

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.710 align:start position:0%
hundred
potential

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
cases relative to the sununu center so
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
big exposure for the state obviously
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
going to happen over multiple years but
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that the legislature is
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
going to monitor the next uh several
 
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
going to monitor the next uh several
months

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
next couple years
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and so total litigation you're you
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
know just you want to watch that you
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
also have the school funding lawsuit
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
that is currently i believe there's a
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
hearing coming up
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have to see what happens with that
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
because that will have an impact on the
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown but it could have a
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the education
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
and then on the bottom of the list and
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
the watch list is statewide labs during
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
a typical year your statewide lapse
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
variance is the one that makes or breaks
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
the state other than revenues
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
but this year with the with the amount
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
of appropriations
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
in how well revenues are doing
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
then the laps at 64.8 million dollars
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a big it won't be a big
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
variance it's the first year for
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
biennium there's a lot of appropriations
 
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.950 align:start position:0%
biennium there's a lot of appropriations
that

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
carry forward into the next fiscal year
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh 64 is not a
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
on an ordinary crazy high figure uh
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
considering you've lapsed close to 200
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
in 21. so
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
those are what
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
what we know of right now obviously this
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
will change we'll look at the monthly
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
revenue focus in january added to this
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
figure and update the committees both
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
finance and ways and means
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
throughout as those monthly revenue
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
focuses come on and then start pulling
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
off the bills that have not passed or
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
have been amended or any additional so
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's where i'll stop my presentation
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
kind of on 22 and i can answer any
 
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.669 align:start position:0%
kind of on 22 and i can answer any
questions

00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mike
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
i do have a question
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund at 257.8
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and you have a watch list on your bottom
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know i would like to see another
 
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.990 align:start position:0%
you know i would like to see another
line

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.950 align:start position:0%
line
and

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
a line that says liability
 
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
a line that says liability
because

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
that 200
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
when you look at that
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
257.8 million dollars wow we got 257.8
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
spend it on
 
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
spend it on
anything

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
anything
but

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things that
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
ought to be put on there
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
so that it balances that out
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
last year when we discussed the ppp
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
whether we should tax it or not
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
that didn't pass until house bill 2
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
so the taxes were collected
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's 100 million dollars
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's not our money
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's part of this rainy day fund
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
another thing
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
is that credit carry over
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
is approaching 290 million dollars right
 
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
is approaching 290 million dollars right
now

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's not our money either but that's
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
part of these figures
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
and if you took both of them we'd
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
probably be running a deficit
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
and all that so
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
is there any reason you couldn't put a
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
line in on
 
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.029 align:start position:0%
line in on
to

00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
indicate the liabilities against the
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.390 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
otherwise

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
people will look at that and say
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
we've got the money you might as well
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
sure i can i can repeat the questions so
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
so senator d'alessandro's question was
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
on the positive side as far as
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
litigation is concerned the state just
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
received settlement from funds from
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
centene relative to uh
 
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.149 align:start position:0%
centene relative to uh
litigation

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general that had
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
settled so that's 20 million dollars so
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
senator dale sanders question was
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
10 of that based on current law 10
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
percent of that goes into the rainy day
 
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.669 align:start position:0%
percent of that goes into the rainy day
fund

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
and will that just happen
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
that will happen prior to the close of
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year but depending if any
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
legislative changes happen prior to the
 
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.430 align:start position:0%
legislative changes happen prior to the
close

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
right now yes that 2 million would go in
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then just to follow up on
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative major yes
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
257.9 million dollars in the rainy day
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
fund but the credit carry over that's an
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
issue that the ways and means committee
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
has been watching very both watching
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
very closely for the last several years
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
it used to be in the tens of millions
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's now hundreds of millions of dollars
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
and what this is is for lack of a better
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
term overpayments by businesses as they
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
pay on estimates
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
so at any point in time
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
not all at once hopefully not all ones
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
is that this is money that is owed back
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the businesses and so they haven't
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner of dra can go over
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
this but they have an option when they
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
file their taxes to use some of these
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
credits so we'll monitor
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
at least the revenues but there are
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
these large outstanding issues
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
or large outstanding policy
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
changes that still haven't hit that
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have to monitor so i can add a
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
couple lines at the bottom with the
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
credit carrier amount which is an amount
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
reported in the um
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
the aquifer and then also the um the
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
amount for any
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
ppp or other potential revenue impacts
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
that could hit the numbers that you're
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
if you've got a question if you go to
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
so on the watch list
 
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.950 align:start position:0%
so on the watch list
um

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
is this i view this especially lines 32
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and 33
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
i view this more of a watch list for
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year because
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
correct i mean it's the
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ends in june 30th
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills will not be signed more than
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
likely earlier probably in june
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
so there really won't be that much of an
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
impact in this fiscal year correct
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
correct so as far as the 390 million and
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
125 are your multiple year impacts
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
you're 22 which we're currently halfway
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
through you're 23 and any some do have a
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
24 impact but both 22 and 23 and as
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative abrami stated
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
as they go through the legislative
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
process there are some
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
most likely this will hit next fiscal
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
year really the watch list is just you
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
know kind of like the credit card
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
forward something for the legislature to
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that although the rainy day
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
fund is at a very healthy level there we
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
do have to monitor as we go into the
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't see any further questions
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
be right on time
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
our next speaker

good morning everyone as chairman major
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned lindsey stepp commissioner new
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of revenue
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
administration with me is keen wong our
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
tax policy council he's going to drive
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
moving to the next slide so as you may
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
know the department of revenue
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
administration administers 14 taxes for
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire which
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
represents just under 80 percent or 2.36
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
billion dollars of audited revenue
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
collected for the general and education
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
trust funds based on fiscal year 2021.
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
the dra we obviously have important
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
insights into the performance of the
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
state's most significant revenue sources
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
but we really lack the capacity to
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
perform more complex economic
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
predictions although you have a great
 
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
predictions although you have a great
lineup

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
lineup
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
to talk about some of that both today
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
and next friday as well
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
just to talk a little bit of the outline
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the presentation we're going to talk
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
about year-to-date revenues we're going
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
to talk about factors that affect the
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
various tax types which can impact the
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
revenue collections and we're going to
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
look at the trend 10-year trend of
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
revenues compared to what plan looks
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
like today
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with representative major
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
what i'll do is i'll stop after each tax
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
type to take questions before we move on
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
to the next one
 
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
to the next one
okay

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
moving on to meals and rentals tax so m
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
r as we refer to it is levied on
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
consumers for the purchase of taxable
 
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
consumers for the purchase of taxable
meals

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
accommodation rentals and motor vehicle
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
rentals the tax rate was nine percent
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
through september 30th of 2021 and was
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
reduced to eight and a half percent for
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
october 1st 2021 forward
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
the tax is collected by the operator and
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
remitted to the dra monthly so when you
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
go out to eat you'll you will pay that
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
tax you will pay it to the restaurant
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
with your bill and then that restaurant
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
operator remits their total taxes that
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
they collect over the month to dra on
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
the 15th of the following month
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
school building aid debt service is a
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
monthly transfer that comes out of gross
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
m r tax revenue
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
this transfer was 14.6 million in fiscal
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
year 12 but has been gradually
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
decreasing to 8.3 million in 21 and is
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
currently at 8.1 million for fiscal year
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
currently at 8.1 million for fiscal year
22.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
just to look at what audited tax revenue
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
has looked like
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh pre and now through covid so we saw a
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
5.5 increase in revenue from 18 to 19
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 18 to fiscal year 19.
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
then with covid
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
starting to impact we saw a 9.9 percent
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
decrease from 19 to 20
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
however we rebounded in 21 with a 6.1
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
percent increase over 20.
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
and year-to-date performance of m r has
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
been very strong fiscal year 2022 actual
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
revenue for the first six months so
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's through december is 29 percent
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
above plan and 3.9
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
above last year
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
i would note you might say why are we so
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
far ahead of plan and not as far ahead
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
of last year there is a new municipal
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
transfer that's occurring in fiscal year
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
22 that's occurring on a monthly basis
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that didn't exist in 21 so that's
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
why those percentages look a little bit
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
off year-to-date transfer for the
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
municipal fund is at
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
51.9 million
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
so year-to-date gross m r revenue so
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
before the transfer
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
is 15.6 per hit
 
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
is 15.6 per hit
15.6

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
15.6
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
ahead or 3.1 percent ahead of the same
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
time period going back to fiscal 19
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
which would be before covid so if you
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
kind of remove the covid impacts and you
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
look pre-covered to today
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
we are 15.6 per percent ahead or 31.1
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
million ahead of the same time period
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
compared to 19. so m r is performing
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
very strongly
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
factors that affect m r tax revenue
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
obviously low unemployment rates people
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
are working they have money to spend
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can see here that
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's unemployment rate is
 
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's unemployment rate is
below

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
the national rate and has improved
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
this year versus last year 2.7 november
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
of this year versus 4.2 percent for
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
november of last year
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
also strong wages people have money to
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
spend federal stimulus money
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
has helped sustain m r
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
weather we like those sunny summers that
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
colorful fall foliage that snow that's
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
in the forecast for tomorrow that's all
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
good for m r you may have seen in the
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
news that this past summer was a record
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
summer tourism in fiscal year 21 with
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
4.4 million visitors which was up 21
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
from 2019
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
and with total spending of 2.1 billion
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
which was up 5 from 2019 so that's
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
certainly helps m r tax revenue
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
also just consumer behavior adapting to
 
00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
also just consumer behavior adapting to
covid

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
transitioning to outdoor dining expanded
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
takeout options we've also seen shifts
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
from people staying in hotels to
 
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
from people staying in hotels to
utilizing

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
rentals via rental agents you know
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
renting a house for a week with your
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
family as opposed to staying in a hotel
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
some stats on that fast food is up seven
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
percent compared to november of 2019
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
and but full-service restaurants have
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
remained flat so there's you can kind of
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
see that little bit of maybe impact of
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
covid where fast food was the best
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
option for people if they wanted to eat
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
out it seems like fast food remains
 
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.630 align:start position:0%
out it seems like fast food remains
strong

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
also with respect to the rentals
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
rental agents are up 168 percent
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
compared to november of 2019 while
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
full-service hotels have remained flat
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
so again i think that is partially due
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
to what we saw with the expanded tourism
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
over the summer more people are coming
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to stay and vacation
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it appears often utilizing that
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
rental agent service as opposed to
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
factors that may affect future m r tax
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
revenue so when we're looking to the
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
next few years
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
the continuing direct effects of cobit
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
19 on consumer behavior
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's a separate i think it's a separate
 
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.910 align:start position:0%
it's a separate i think it's a separate
presentation

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'll keep talking i think most of in the
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
audience have a picture have the copy in
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
infection and hospital rates you know
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
this could affect
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
m r revenue if people
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't venture out to eat out or stay in
 
00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
don't venture out to eat out or stay in
hotels

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
hotels
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and then just general public
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
sentiment on social distancing if folks
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable eating in a full
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
service restaurant that may impact our
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.310 align:start position:0%
service restaurant that may impact our
revenue

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
economic factors that affect consumer
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
behavior the end of federal stimulus
 
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.990 align:start position:0%
behavior the end of federal stimulus
monies

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
monies
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic unreal related employment
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
trends again unemployment is falling
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's good more people having money in
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
their pockets
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
strong wages drive consumer demand again
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
another positive thing for m r
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
you know a point to note though about a
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
concern staffing needs in the in the
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
hotel and hospitality and restaurant
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
industry you know if hotels or
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
restaurants don't have the staff to be
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
open then they can't sell the meals or
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
rent the rooms that are taxable
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
so the the constraints on the workforce
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality industry
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
is something that we want to watch and
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
see if it impacts m r revenue
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
supply chain constraints
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
inflation and rising fuel prices of
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
inflation continues and fuel prices
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
increase that could impact the number of
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
people that are able to spend the money
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
to travel say to new hampshire for their
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
summer vacation
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
and again as we talked about this the
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
shift that we've kind of seen in
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
behavior and spending from pre-pandemic
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
to you know where we are today you know
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a new normal
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that fast food is is a larger driver
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the shift to rental rental agents
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to full service hotels that
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
may continue in the future
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
so those are things that we'll be
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
watching we look at that breakdown on a
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and we'll continue to
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
track the trends there
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the next slide is a nice 10-year picture
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
of m r tax revenue
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
so you will see the top
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
dashed line is fiscal 2021 plan revenue
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
the green line is 22 plan revenue which
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
will be net of that municipal transfer
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
of about 100 million dollars in total
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and then the blue line is actual
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
so you will notice that 2021 performed
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
under plan even though it was a strong
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
year but obviously the plan for 21 was
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
developed in fiscal year 19 it was the
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium so we didn't know
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
that kovit was coming we didn't know the
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
impacts so even though it was a strong
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
performance it is showing below plan and
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
then again you'll see that large
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
difference between fiscal 21 actual and
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
plan but that is the result of the net
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the municipal transfer of about 100
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
the next slide on page six just provides
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of the meals and rentals tax
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
by activity type
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
so as we as we've mentioned
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax taxes meals
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
rooms and motor vehicle rentals so you
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
can see that the breakdown is fairly
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
consistent meals is our largest activity
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
type within the m r tax
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
you will see a slight shift in fiscal
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
to the meals where meals represented
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
82.1 percent
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
that is the highest over the period
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's shown here
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that that is really
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
coming kind of a shift out of room
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
rentals that are at 15.8 percent which
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
is one of the lowest years that we've
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
seen so meals have were the strong
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
performer in fiscal year 21.
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
that is the last slide on m r so i'm
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
happy to pause here and take any
 
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.550 align:start position:0%
happy to pause here and take any
questions

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you've got a if you have a question
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
on slide on page five where it shows the
 
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
on slide on page five where it shows the
graph

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
now this is gross revenue
 
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:36.390 align:start position:0%
now this is gross revenue
correct

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
question is that can you
 
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
question is that can you
provide

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
when we work the issue
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
you want to know what the
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
total revenue is that's coming in
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
because we're not always aware we keep
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
forgetting what's being taken away from
 
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
forgetting what's being taken away from
it

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
and if we plan with this
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
we can definitely provide the graph both
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
ways and when you start doing your
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates in the next
 
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.589 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates in the next
year

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
we will give you the gross amount so you
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
can apply growth rates to the gross
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
amount and then take out the various
 
00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
amount and then take out the various
transfers

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you for joining us
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the senate we're debating some bills
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the question arose is the rim system
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
which seems to be operating very well
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that smooth transition
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
is that capable of localizing the source
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
of mnr revenues by type sure
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that question has come up numerous
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
times over the years you know being can
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
we take m r revenue and attribute the
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
revenue to each and every town
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
and in some instances yes in other
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
instances no
 
00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
instances no
so

00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you are a standalone bakery that
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
operates on main street in concord and
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
you report under your address in concord
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
then we can attribute that revenue to
 
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.390 align:start position:0%
then we can attribute that revenue to
you

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
if you are a local chain of restaurants
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and you operate say in concord
 
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.710 align:start position:0%
and you operate say in concord
manchester

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
and nashua you are able to file a
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
consolidated return so you can file one
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
return for all three of those locations
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
and you might use your nashua address to
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
file that consolidated return
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
report the exact revenue for each and
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
every city in town we would then need
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
that operator
 
00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:40.230 align:start position:0%
that operator
to

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
break out for us what was from nashua
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
what was manchester what was conquered
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
so it's an additional step that
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
operators would need to take
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
and we would need to essentially
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
disallow the consolidated filing
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
the other issue that
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
comes up is if it is a very small town
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
two or three m r operators within a town
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
say there's two restaurants
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
that would violate our confidentiality
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
provisions because if we were released
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
that number and you operated one of
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
those restaurants you now know exactly
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
what your competitors revenues are so we
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
what your competitors revenues are so we
we

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
have confidentiality provisions and
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
policies at the department where at the
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
municipal level we don't like to report
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
on anything less than 20. on a statewide
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
level it would be 10 but at a local
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
level we try to have 20 data points
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
before we report a number to preserve
 
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
before we report a number to preserve
confidentiality

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to the uh thank you mr
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair i want to go back to the reporting
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the revenues and the net part and
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's like three or four of these that
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
are out there in different areas of not
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
just m r i mean it'd be great if we had
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
a big powwow on this and come up with a
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
way because we just love
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
we'd love to just track pure revenues in
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
and have that above the line and then
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
all the all the things that are going
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
into different funds fine
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that should be secondary because we
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
i know you're not responsible revenue
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
focus but we do look at revenue focus
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
which is not your department but
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think we need a powwow with everybody
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a way that we can all agree
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
is a good way to to present the revenues
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
every month for us to understand thank
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
you sure and you're correct there are
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
multiple transfers every month that
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
occur there's transfers school building
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
aid and municipal transfer now out of m
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
r in the real estate transfer
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
tax there's the l-chip transfer and a 5
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
million affordable housing fund transfer
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
that happens every fall so there's been
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
more and more of those over the last few
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
years so we can and we certainly as i
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier would want to develop
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
a revenue plan on the gross amount
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it is still money being
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
collected and then take those transfers
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you thank you
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's a point though that
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that people miss and that's the three
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
percent vigorage
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
causes us a loss of revenue that remains
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the vendor
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
now does that occur with the car rentals
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
also is it's across the board so
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to retain three percent
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct if they are filing timely and
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
filing electronically which is our
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
preferred method under statute for the
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax then the operator
 
00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax then the operator
for

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
to compensate them from collecting all
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
of your money when you go out to eat and
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
remitting it to the state on a monthly
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
basis they do keep three percent so so
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you were to do the breakdown that
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
some people are asking for
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
the breakdown would be reduced by the
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
three percent correct and people have to
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that that it's not they're
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
looking at one amount but it really it's
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
three percent less right and so again
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
that could be another area that we
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
forecast the gross amount before the
 
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.589 align:start position:0%
forecast the gross amount before the
commission

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
um because that is still money that is
 
00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:27.270 align:start position:0%
um because that is still money that is
collected

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is just retained by the operator for
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
their uh to compensate them for their
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
on to the real estate transfer tax so
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax is on the
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
transfer sale and granting a real
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
property at a rate of 1.50 per 100 of
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
the price or consideration that is
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
typically split
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
75 cents to the purchaser and 75 cents
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
to the seller rent revenue has increased
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
in recent years we saw a 2.5 percent
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
increase from 18 to 19
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
a 3.7 percent increase from 19 to 20
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
and then a 32.4 increase from 20 to 21
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
primarily driven by the effects of
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
the housing market values in the housing
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
market increasing more people moving to
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
rural areas like here in new hampshire
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
they've seen the light they know that
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful place to live
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 22 actual revenues for the
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
first six months of the year are 8.1
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
percent of prior year and
 
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
percent of prior year and
18.9

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
18.9
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
factors that affect
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
revenue low interest rates obviously
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
help with the sales of
 
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.589 align:start position:0%
help with the sales of
housing

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
that amount or that interest rate was at
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
3.07 percent for october of 21.
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
obviously that might be ticking up in
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
the next few months as interest rates
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
increase due to inflation
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
strong demand coupled by decreasing
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
inventory levels
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
shift as i mentioned from urban to more
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
rural areas
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
and also property values so property
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
total equalized value for new hampshire
 
00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:09.990 align:start position:0%
total equalized value for new hampshire
on

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
for april of 2021 was
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
193.5 billion dollars
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that's versus
 
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.109 align:start position:0%
and that's versus
eight

00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
184.9 billion in april of 2020.
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
looking back we've seen approximately a
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
five percent increase in total equalized
 
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.230 align:start position:0%
five percent increase in total equalized
value

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
over the past three years so the value
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
of property in new hampshire is
 
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.710 align:start position:0%
of property in new hampshire is
increasing

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
factors that may affect future rent
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
revenue the current housing market trend
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
obviously there's strong demand for
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
homes home prices continue to remain
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
strong but there is that lack of
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
inventory so really rhett revenue is the
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
balance between
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
sales volume and price if sales go down
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
if the volume goes down but the price
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
goes up your revenue can sustain
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
alternatively if the price falls but the
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
volume goes up your revenue can sustain
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
and we'll see that on the next slide
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
where we're going to see rent revenue
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
fall is with the decreased inventory and
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
if those housing prices start falling
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
then that will will see the negative
 
00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
then that will will see the negative
impact

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of the economy again low
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and strong wages wages
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
are helpful for rent people have buying
 
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.870 align:start position:0%
are helpful for rent people have buying
power

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
inflation on the rise and a rise in
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
consumer prices and energy prices could
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
tamper on the hot real estate market
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been seeing
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's been some changes in behavior
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
due to cobid virtual home sales were not
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
really a thing pre-covered but
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think we may have all heard stories of
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
people buying houses cite unseen based
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
on a virtual home tour so that
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
definitely helped us
 
00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:49.190 align:start position:0%
definitely helped us
sustain

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
sustain
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
sales and transactions during the
 
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
sales and transactions during the
pandemic

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
folks have been doing a lot of home
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
improvements increasing their home value
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
and then some folks have been putting
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
their homes on the market increasing
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
their rent revenue
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then obviously the ability to work
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
from home being able to move away from
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
those urban centers live in a more rural
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
state like new hampshire
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
and purchase and live purchase a home
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
and live here
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
things that we're looking at in terms of
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
the future as i mentioned increasing in
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
interest rates due to inflation
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's still that strong buyer demand
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
but if that does start to decrease
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
that could impact rhett and also the
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
impact as we've mentioned on inventory
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
it is very low
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
inventory in december of 2021 decreased
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
year over year by 34.4 percent for
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
single family homes and 41 percent for
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
townhouse or condo properties so that's
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
just a one-year decrease so december of
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
for to look at the specific
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
year-over-year change for rhett so for
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
november of 21 november of this calendar
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
year new property listings pending sales
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
and monthly supply of inventory for a
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
single family homes and condos decreased
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
from a year ago
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
but for november 21 the median sales
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
price for single-family homes and condos
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
increased compared to 2020. so the
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
average sale price for a single-family
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
home in new hampshire was 401 thousand
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in november of 21 and the
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
average sale for a condo in new
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire in november of 21 was 310 000.
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
so in the chart there you can see the
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
sales price year over year has gone up
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
by 13.6 percent
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the inventory has gone down by 30.8
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
percent for single-family homes
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
so again if those things move in
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
opposite directions we can sustain the
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
revenue but if they start to trend in
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
the same direction that's where when
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
we'll start to see a decrease in red
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
increasing construction and material
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
costs and supply chain issues are
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
causing a four to twelve month backlog
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
of certain materials
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
per the associated general contractors
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
of america that is going to impact your
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
inventory it's difficult to get the
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
supply supplies necessary to build new
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
homes to put them on the market
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
december just last month was the lowest
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
month in the last year on the
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
affordability index for single family
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
homes so single family homes had an
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
affordability index of 101 in december
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
of 21 which means the median household
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
household income was 101 percent of what
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
was necessary to qualify for a median
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
price home under the prevailing interest
 
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
price home under the prevailing interest
rates

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
in one hand that's a good thing it's
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
more than a hundred percent so people
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
should qualify but by contrast
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
the state's residential affordability
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
index has been as high as 220
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
in february of 2012 and there was a
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
seven year period between 2009 and 2016
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
during which the index never dropped
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
below 150.
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
so that's where you're you know hearing
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
people say i just can't afford
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
to buy a new home i can't afford to move
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
that affordability index has come way
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the red 10-year revenue trend
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
again that green line is 22 plan
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
the red dash line is 21 plan and then
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
the blue solid line is the trend we've
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
seen over the last 10 years
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
similar to m r that 21 plant amount
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
which looks very low compared to actuals
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
for 21 that plan was developed in in
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal 19 so it was before we started to
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
see this real
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
boom in the housing market
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
you will note
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
that plan for 22 that green line is less
 
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
that plan for 22 that green line is less
than

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
than
um

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
actuals we did anticipate
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
that this housing market was gonna start
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
to cool off
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened yet
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why you will hear that we are
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
above plan and we are above prior year
 
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
above plan and we are above prior year
we

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
just assumed at some point this was
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to slow down i think it
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
does still have to slow down it just
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened yet
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
so we'll see what the last
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
six months of the fiscal year bring
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
and with that i will pause for questions
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
if there are any on the real estate
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
onward to the tobacco tax so tobacco tax
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
is levied on each pack of cigarettes at
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
a rate of dollar 78 per pack of 20
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and 2.23 cents per pack of 25
 
00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:47.190 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and 2.23 cents per pack of 25
cigarettes

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax is also levied on other
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so non-cigarettes but
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
still tobacco at a rate of
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
65.03 percent of the wholesale sales
 
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.630 align:start position:0%
65.03 percent of the wholesale sales
price

00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
so the tobacco tax is a makeup of the
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
stamp revenue and the other tobacco
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
product revenue
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
included in other tobacco products is
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
also e-cigarettes
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
given the the content or the fact that
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes contain nicotine
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
so audited tobacco tax revenue over the
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
last three years we saw a 4.3 percent
 
00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:18.470 align:start position:0%
last three years we saw a 4.3 percent
decrease

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
from 18 to 19
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
a 5.7 increase from 19 to 20
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
18.1 percent increase from 20 to 21.
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date actual through
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
december were 1.9 below plan and 4.8
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
percent below prior year
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
really the composition of the tobacco
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
tax is changing
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
otp has grown and currently makes up
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of the tobacco tax
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
compared to looking at a decade ago in
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
2012 it was only 3.4 percent of the
 
00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
2012 it was only 3.4 percent of the
revenue

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute to the tobacco
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
tax cross-border elasticity so
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts implemented a ban on
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
methylated and all-flavored tobacco
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
products in effect on june 1 of 2020.
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
that has and we'll see this in later
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
slides has really driven the tobacco tax
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
revenue here in new hampshire if you
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
talk to convenience stores or any
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
sellers of cigarettes near the border
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
they were having a hard time keeping
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
mentholated products in stock because
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be sold in massachusetts
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
so people from massachusetts were coming
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to purchase those
 
00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:26.789 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to purchase those
products

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
same with any mentholated or flavored
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
also factors contributing to the tobacco
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
tax revenue is the implementation and
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
now full fiscal year results of taxation
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to the next slide so just to go
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
over the e-cigarette tax that went into
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
effect on january 1 2020 and it's levied
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
on closed systems and open systems so a
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
closed system is kind of a one-piece you
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
buy the e-cigarette
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
liquid is already contained within the
 
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
liquid is already contained within the
cartridge

00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
cartridge
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
open system would be an e-cigarette
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
where you can swap out the liquid
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it's separate from the actual
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
electronic cigarette
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're taxed differently so closed
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
systems are taxed at 30 cents per
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
milliliter on the volume of the liquid
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then open systems are taxed at eight
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the wholesale sales price on
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
the container of liquid
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll see the e-cigarette tax fiscal
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
year 21 was a full fiscal year of the
 
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.549 align:start position:0%
year 21 was a full fiscal year of the
tax

00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
generated just over five million dollars
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
of the tobacco tax and year-to-date we
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
are at 3.8 million dollars so it is
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
proving to be
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
a fairly significant
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
portion of tobacco tax revenue
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the tobacco tax 10-year trend
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see the tobacco taxes kind of
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
fluctuated over the years from 2016 to
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
2019 we had seen a pretty consistent
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
downward trend approximately three
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
percent a year
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
however with the impact of covid and the
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
ban of mentholated products and flavored
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
products in massachusetts you'll see the
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
pretty significant increase from 19 to
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
20 and 20 to 21.
 
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.190 align:start position:0%
20 and 20 to 21.
so

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
that will i think remain at this similar
 
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
that will i think remain at this similar
level

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
given the ban in massachusetts and just
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
the driving of consumers here to new
 
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
the driving of consumers here to new
hampshire

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
you can see on the next slide this is
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
just tobacco tax stamp revenue so this
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
is just revenue that's on those packages
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
again you'll see that increase from 19
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
to 20 to 21
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
in particular due to
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
people purchasing methylated cigarettes
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire where they can't
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
purchase them in massachusetts
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
and then on the next slide this shows
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
the increase that we've seen in other
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco products again i mentioned that
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's increased substantially over the
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
the portion shown in orange is what we
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
the tax revenue that's attributable
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
attributable just to e-cigarettes so you
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
can see how that makes up the total for
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
other tobacco tax product revenue
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll pause for any tobacco
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
i know i asked you thank you mr chair i
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
know i see this lindsay
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
during the budget process
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
our only concern my only concern is that
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts will figure out that maybe
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake and that will repeat
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
they would
 
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
they would
peel

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
peel
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
the methyl thing so have you been bird
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
dogging that a bit maybe any other
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
idea where that is maybe i have not
 
00:59:57.599 --> 00:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
idea where that is maybe i have not
heard

00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
any desire by massachusetts
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
to reverse that ban
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
i know that obviously in new hampshire
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
a positive impact on
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
revenue due to that ban and i've also
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
been speaking to my counterparts in
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
rhode island who have seen a similar
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
increase as well but we have not heard
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
anything about massachusetts reversing
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.599 --> 01:00:26.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
on to interest and dividends tax
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
ind is currently assessed at a rate of 5
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
on interest and dividend income of
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
individuals partnerships and fiduciaries
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
audited ind revenue over the last three
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
years we saw an 8.4
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
increase from eighteen to nineteen a
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
nine point six percent increase from
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
nineteen to twenty and then a four
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
percent decrease from twenty to twenty
 
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.030 align:start position:0%
percent decrease from twenty to twenty
one

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
actual revenue for the first six months
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
so through december of the current
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is 21.1 percent above plan
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
and 17.3 percent below prior year
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
again you'll note that distinction there
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
we're above plan yet we're below prior
 
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
we're above plan yet we're below prior
year

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the reason why we're below prior
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
years we saw a significant amount of
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax revenue in
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
july of fiscal year 21 that was due to
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
the federal due date change in the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
individual income tax we did not follow
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
that same due date change in new
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire but many individuals
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
submitted per the federal due date so we
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
saw the money show up in july that would
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
have actually been due
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
in june we extended our due date to june
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
feds went till july a lot of people
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
followed the federal deadline so that's
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
why it's looking like we're very low
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
compared to prior year it's really just
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
a timing issue
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
ind tax rates will reduce by one percent
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
each year for the taxable periods ending
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2023 forward and the ind
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
tax will be fully repealed for taxable
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
periods beginning after december 31st
 
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.829 align:start position:0%
periods beginning after december 31st
2026

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
2026
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is per house bill 2 of the last
 
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.589 align:start position:0%
that is per house bill 2 of the last
session

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
factors that can affect ind obviously
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
economy and stock market performance
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
changing makeup of how ind is paid
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see on a later slide we've seen
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
really a shift
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years or so away from
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
interest and more towards dividends
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
making up our distributions making up a
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
larger portion of the interest and
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
dividends tax revenue
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
past federal tax reform
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
there's been federal tax changes over
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
the years some might remember the fiscal
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
cliff a few years back that caused some
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
behavioral changes in some businesses
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that caused them to accelerate dividends
 
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.789 align:start position:0%
that caused them to accelerate dividends
into

01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
december of a year rather than january
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
so we do kind of
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
watch what's happening federally because
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
that can kind of shift revenues around
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
with respect to ind
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
money in the bank determines how much
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
interest you earn on it and obviously
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
the interest rates impact how much
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
interest as well
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
ind tax revenue 10-year trend you will
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
see that we are planning an increase in
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 over 21.
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
you will see though from 2016
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
up until 2020 there was a fairly
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
consistent increase year-over-year in
 
01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
consistent increase year-over-year in
ind

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
ind
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's approximately
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
7 percent increase
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
since 2016 that we've seen and that kind
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
of blip from 20 and 21
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
is for audited revenue while the money
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
was collected in july
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
we did move it back for auditing
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
purposes to fiscal year 20. so that's
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
why you see that weird kind of bump
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
on slide 18
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned interest and dividends
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
tax components a 10-year trend
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the top um
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
line at the chart at the bottom
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
distributions you'll see in tax year 11
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
distributions made up 21.2 percent of
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax revenue
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
in 2020 that was 41.5
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
so that's really an indication of a
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
strong economy
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
and businesses issuing distributions
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
again as i mentioned going down to
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
interest interest in tax year 11 was at
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
33.3 percent went to a high of 41.2 in
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
tax year 13 higher interest rates and
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
then as interest rates have fallen over
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
the past few years we're down to 12.2
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the ind tax being made up
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
by interest so i think it's just
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
important here to know you hear interest
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
and dividends and my mind admittedly
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
goes to interest but the various
 
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.190 align:start position:0%
goes to interest but the various
components

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
do kind of move in opposite directions
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
at times and so that can kind of help
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
that is all i had on ind happy to answer
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
no all right onward utility property tax
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
upt is taxed on the value of utility
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
property at a rate of six dollars and
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
sixty cents per one thousand dollars of
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
value as determined by the dra
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
as of each april first
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
upt revenue over the past few years we
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
saw a 12.5 percent decrease in 19 over
 
01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:23.630 align:start position:0%
saw a 12.5 percent decrease in 19 over
18

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
9.6 increase in 20 over 19. 11.8 percent
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
decrease in 21 over 20.
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
year-to-date through december we're
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
about 5.5 below plan and 13.4 percent
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
below unaudited revenue
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
tax year 2021 assessments totaled 42.8
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
million in tax so roughly the upt is
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
between 40 and 45 million dollars a year
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
but the total value of utility property
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that generates that 42.8 million is 6.5
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.789 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
in

01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
factors that can impact upt development
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
of new renewable energy facilities
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's more taxable property
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
valuation of the property obviously is
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
directly tied to the tax so higher value
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
higher tax
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
energy pricing supply and demand that
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
impacts the profits of the utilities and
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
therefore impacts their property value
 
01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:23.430 align:start position:0%
therefore impacts their property value
so

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
those can factor into their property
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
values and contribute to the tax
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
it's a short section on upt if there are
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
no questions i'll move on to
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
communication services tax
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
cst is a tax of seven percent on all
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
two-way communications
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
in 2012 there was an exclusion of
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
charges for internet access which
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
decreased cst revenue significantly
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
so from 2009 to 2012 cst revenue was
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
between 76.5 million and 81 million
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
after the exclusion 2013 to 2017 cst
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenue has been between 47.1 million
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
and 59.3 million
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
revenue has been fairly consistent over
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
the last few years between 39.8 million
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
and 43.4
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we're about 18
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
percent below plan and 16 percent below
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
unaudited revenue
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
prior year on audited revenue that's
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
primarily due to some taxpayers using up
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
some credits that they had on account
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
factors that can affect cst
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
decrease in landlines
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
modern pricing and purchasing trends for
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
wireless communications and a move to
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
voip and video conferencing
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
again fairly small tax but wanted to
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that you had the full picture
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
with that i'll move on to business taxes
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
i saved that for the end
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
do we capture all the different types of
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
so yes the department's position is that
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
the majority of video conferencing is
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
two-way communication
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
under the communication services tax and
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
so we've been working with the large
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
providers of those services to ensure
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they are reporting and remitting
 
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
that they are reporting and remitting
appropriately

01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
as you know business taxes has made up
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
the business made up of the business
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax and the business profits
 
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax and the business profits
tax

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
the bet is assessed on the sum of all
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
compensation paid or accrued interest
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
paid or accrued and dividends paid by
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
the business
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
bbt is assessed on the income from the
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
conduct of business activity within the
 
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
conduct of business activity within the
state

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
currently the bpt conforms to the united
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
states internal revenue code of 1986
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
that was in effect on december 31st of
 
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
that was in effect on december 31st of
2018

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
with adjustments and that is applicable
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods beginning on or
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
after january 1 of 2020.
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
factors that can affect business taxes
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy federal tax reform
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
and stimulus programs mergers and
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
acquisitions credits or exemptions and
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
statutory changes and i'll touch on some
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
so highlights of some recent statutory
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
changes we've made quite a few
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
so market-based sourcing apportionment
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
for the sourcing or apportionment of
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
services began for taxable periods
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
ending on or after december 31st of 2021
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so we will start to see the impact
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
of that on returns that will be filed
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
beginning in march and april of this
 
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.590 align:start position:0%
beginning in march and april of this
year

01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
single sales factor apportionment will
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
begin for taxable periods ending on or
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
after december 31st of 2022 so that's
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
where we move from our current three
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
factor apportionment
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
of payroll property and sales to just
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
apportioning based on a businesses sales
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that's for the calendar year that
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're currently in
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's also an increase to gross
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
business income bpt filing threshold
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
from 50 000 to 92 000 for taxable
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after december 31st
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
of 2022
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
likely to have a small
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
revenue impact but will basically
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of returns that we
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
will receive and process so it's
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
favorable to the businesses if they're
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
are submitting um if they have a filing
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
threshold but they're not paying any tax
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
they won't need to
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
make those submissions anymore
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
and we also increased the bet filing
 
01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
and we also increased the bet filing
threshold

01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
for gross business receipts to 220 000
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
or 250 000 from 220 and the enterprise
 
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.790 align:start position:0%
or 250 000 from 220 and the enterprise
value

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
threshold went from 110 000 to 250 000
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
as representative major mentioned
 
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
as representative major mentioned
earlier

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the forgiven paycheck protection program
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
loans will be excluded from bpt
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact is approximately 100
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars based on dra estimates
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then we did see a reduction in or
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
we'll see a reduction in bpt rates from
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
7.7 to 7.6 percent and bet rates 0.6 to
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
0.55 for taxable periods ending on or
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
after december 31st of 2022.
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these legislation
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
legislative changes or statutory changes
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
are in effect for the current calendar
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
year that we're in
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll start to see the effects of
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
that through businesses estimate
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
payments that we receive
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
in april june september and december and
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
then on return filings that we receive
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
another change that i wanted to mention
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
based on representative major's comments
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
about the credit carryover limits
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
limits imposed currently there's no
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
limit on a business's credit carryover
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
they can carry they can file estimates
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
with us they can pay a bunch of money
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
and then they can leave that money on
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
account to carry it forward
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
there will be limits imposed beginning
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods ending 1231 of 22
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that will start at 500 percent of
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
their taxable liability so they cannot
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
have a cco that's in excess of 500 of
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
their current year liability anything in
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
excess will need to be refunded
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
that cap then goes to 250
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
for 1231 of 2025 and down to a hundred
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
percent of their taxable liability in
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
1231 2027. so that almost 300 297
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
million in credit carryover that
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative major mentioned earlier
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
that will start to decrease as these
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
just looking at business tax revenue for
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
2012 to 2021
 
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
2012 to 2021
[Music]

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
really the point of this slide is just
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
to show you
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue can be sort of
 
01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue can be sort of
volatile

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
volatile
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
recent volatility really has been
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
magnified by covid and federal due date
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
changes but here you can see the
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
year-over-year change dollar amount and
 
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
year-over-year change dollar amount and
percent

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
in revenue and then we also highlighted
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
the change in dollar and percent of the
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
plan revenue so even even plan has kind
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
of fluctuated over the past few years
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 actual revenue for the
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
first six months again through december
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
is 16.9 percent ahead of plan and 27.9
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of prior year so fiscal year 2022
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
is off to a strong start as
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
mr kane mentioned earlier these are
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
numbers through
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
december but january revenue remains
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
factors that impact business tax revenue
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
first looking at kind of towards the
 
01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
first looking at kind of towards the
past

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.070 align:start position:0%
past
um

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
factors that contributed to business tax
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
revenues overall business gains were
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
experienced in the technology medical
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
retail and financial sectors over the
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think particularly
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
these are some industries that did well
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
during covet right retail
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
sales have been very high
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
obviously the medical industry
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
and technology have
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
performed very well during the pandemic
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
looking to the future
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
direct effects of covid19
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know can businesses sustain
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
infection rates at the workplaces can
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
they sustain a remote model going
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
forward it has proved very successful
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
for a lot of businesses so hopefully
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is not a negative impact
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
on the economy and on business taxes
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned previously with mnr
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage is something that i
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
think we need to kind of keep our eye on
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether that could have a
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
negative effect on business taxes
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
businesses don't have the workers to
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
perform the work they can't generate the
 
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
perform the work they can't generate the
profit

01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
profit
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
that ultimately would be taxed under the
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
bpt so that's something to keep an eye
 
01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
bpt so that's something to keep an eye
on

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
we mentioned the statutory changes on a
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
prior slide
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
also just general trends in the economy
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
that i think we've all heard about the
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
supply chain constraints are certainly
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
impacting businesses and their ability
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
to perform their functions and generate
 
01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
to perform their functions and generate
profits

01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
profits
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
inflation rates
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the ending of stimulus programs
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
could impact consumer spending again
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
affecting profits
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then the low unemployment rate
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
is great when you have all the workers
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
that you need but can be difficult when
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're trying to hire
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
future outlook potential
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
interest rate increase that i think
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about and then you know
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're also looking globally at the
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
geopolitical instability that is
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
existing right now and what
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
if any effect that might have here in
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
you may have seen in the news that
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
nationally gdp grew at 6.9 percent
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
predictions had been at 5.5 percent so
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
6.9 percent gdp growth exceeded
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
expectations it was the strongest growth
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
of gdp for a full year since 1984.
 
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.630 align:start position:0%
of gdp for a full year since 1984.
um

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
but you know as we're mentioning in this
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
slide you know there's definitely
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
headwinds to that growth and whether or
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
not that can be sustained
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
is probably unlikely so something we're
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
watching as well revenues for us don't
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
typically track
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
very consistently towards gdp you know
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
gdp is just kind of one of the factors
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we factor in but it's not to say
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
that if gdp increases by 6.9 then we're
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to see the same increase in
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
business taxes there's not that direct
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
relationship but it is one of the things
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of a 10-year trend
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
you see a little bit of that volatility
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
you will see that the plan the fiscal
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
2022 plan in the green dashed line
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
is less than
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021
 
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021
actual

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
and that's primarily due to the fact
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
that june of last year
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
was a very strong revenue month we had
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
already completed our revenue estimating
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
and we thought we were we had kind of
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
hit the nail on the head but we had
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
actually underestimated
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
june revenue came in about 20 million
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
dollars higher than we anticipated so
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's why you see that that we actually
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
ended last year higher than plan for
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
although i think we all assumed a
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
this is a historic look at the makeup of
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes so our primary business
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
taxes come into the dra in a variety of
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
ways they come in through tax notices
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
we find either an audit issue or we find
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
that you maybe
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
submitted a return without a payment we
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
send you a tax notice
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
um returns those are the final big
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
documents at the end of of the year that
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
businesses file so we receive money
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
through returns
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
extensions taxpayers are able to
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
pay their full liability by the due date
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
which would be in march or april
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
depending on the entity type and then
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
they get an automatic seven month
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
extension to file the paper returns so
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
as long as you've paid the money by the
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
due date we give you another seven
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
months to complete that nice thick
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
filing that you need to send to us so we
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
receive a fair amount of revenue through
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
extensions where taxpayers are making
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that payment in order to have the
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
additional time to file the return
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
but you'll notice the largest makeup of
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
the revenue is in the form of estimates
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
so taxpayers file four quarterly
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
estimates in april june september and
 
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.630 align:start position:0%
estimates in april june september and
december

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
december
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the issue with estimates it's a it's
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
a large portion of the revenue that we
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
receive and there's not a lot of
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
information on the estimate it's a nice
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
simple form with your name your address
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
your taxpayer identification number and
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
the amount that you want to send us
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't have details from estimates
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
about why that estimate might be more or
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
less than the prior year estimate for
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
the same taxpayer
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
which is why we need to ultimately wait
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
for those returns to come in before we
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
can really dissect what's going on with
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the next slide is a similar breakdown
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
just based on entity type
 
01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:04.390 align:start position:0%
just based on entity type
so

01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
we have fiduciaries proprietorships
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
partnerships and as you can see
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
corporations are our largest taxpayer
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
they are consistently the majority of
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
our revenue
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
for anyone that has spent some time
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the dras annual report this
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
might look familiar to you based on the
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
triangles that we produce and the fact
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of our revenue
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
the next slide just shows a breakdown
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
over the past
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
decade or so of the business enterprise
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
tax versus the business profits tax
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see that they tend to track
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
consistently so if one goes up the other
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
one goes up but you'll note in 21
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 21 the slope of those lines
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
are different
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a greater shift towards
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
the bpt
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the bet
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that largely has to do with
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
the trends that we mentioned earlier in
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
the economy of those industries that
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
have performed very well you know retail
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
technology medical there's been a lot of
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
large profits
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
that have been apportioned here to new
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire um and that is more necessary
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that same growth in our
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax base so greater
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
growth in profits compared to the base
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
of wages interest and dividends of the
 
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.590 align:start position:0%
of wages interest and dividends of the
bet

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
i will pause there for business tax
 
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
i will pause there for business tax
questions

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
i've got a question it pertains to
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
potentially

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry and then
 
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:14.950 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry and then
what

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
are you able to extract
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
from this
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the effect of the various stimuluses
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
that have gone on
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
because the stimulus is going to go away
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
when it goes away
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
where are we going to end up at is it
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the first question is that that growth
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
you see from 20 to 21
 
01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.030 align:start position:0%
you see from 20 to 21
could

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
ppp be contributing to that growth so
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
as mr kane mentioned earlier you'll
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire given our conformity to
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the internal revenue code
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
ppp loans were taxable to forgiven ppp
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
loans were taxable here in new hampshire
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
although they were tax exempt federally
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
until around june
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
when the legislation passed to make them
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
tax exempt so there is the potential
 
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.669 align:start position:0%
tax exempt so there is the potential
that

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid following the new
 
01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:25.750 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid following the new
hampshire

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
code as if those forgiven amounts were
 
01:23:28.639 --> 01:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
code as if those forgiven amounts were
taxable

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then they were deemed not to be
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
taxable so we may be in a refund
 
01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:36.790 align:start position:0%
taxable so we may be in a refund
situation

01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think what we're learning
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
as we continue to dissect the numbers is
 
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
as we continue to dissect the numbers is
that

01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
some some taxpayers did pay based on
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
their forgiven ppp and will be in either
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
in a refund or credit situation
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
others because of the delay in the
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
forgiveness official forgiveness of the
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
loans taxpayers waited to see
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not the loan would be
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
forgiven and so if they waited they it
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
was still alone which was not taxable at
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
the time that they filed
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we received the full
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
hundred million and i don't think we'll
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
see the full 100 million be a reef under
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
credit it's somewhere in between
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we just don't know exactly
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
where in between because we could not
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
tie out the data from the small business
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
administration directly to our data in
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
second question
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
was related to stimulus and whether or
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
not we will see
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
a potential decline in revenues as the
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
stimulus program child tax credit
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
programs come to an end
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think there's potential for that i
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean certainly the stimulus
 
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.270 align:start position:0%
mean certainly the stimulus
gave

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
gave
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
individuals money to spend we mentioned
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
earlier how well the retail sector or
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
the retail industry did during the past
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
few years and i think that's largely due
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the fact that people had money in
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
their pocket to spend
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
so that that could be something
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
impact revenues going forward however we
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a direct connection
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know i can't say that this you know
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of stimulus money that
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
this person received directly um made a
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
direct connection to business taxes so
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
it'll really just have to be something
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
that we watch and certainly if the
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
economy continues to grow
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
then the stimulus programs will have
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
propelled the economy
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if it continues to grow then
 
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.149 align:start position:0%
and if it continues to grow then
hopefully

01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
so will our revenues but if the economy
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
starts to taper off or decline then
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the lack of stimulus there
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
could become more apparent with respect
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair lindsay again um
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
let's go back to market-based sourcing
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know when we were debating this
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
couple years ago in the house ways and
 
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.550 align:start position:0%
couple years ago in the house ways and
means

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah when we were debating uh
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing several years ago
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
we concluded that
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
it was very important that the dra be
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
able to identify
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
service companies in other states that
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be providing services to
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i i just want to i'm just curious to
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
how we're doing at that sure thank you
 
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.310 align:start position:0%
how we're doing at that sure thank you
so

01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
so market-based sourcing went into
 
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.750 align:start position:0%
so market-based sourcing went into
effect

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods ending december 31st
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
of 2021 so the calendar year that just
 
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
of 2021 so the calendar year that just
ended

01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
ended
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
it is a focus of our audit division but
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
i will say
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why market-based
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
sourcing kind of came to light
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was still using a cost of
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
performance method for the apportionment
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
of services so we looked to where the
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
service was being performed
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
as opposed to market-based sourcing
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
which looks at where the service was
 
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.590 align:start position:0%
which looks at where the service was
received

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
cost of performance was inconsistent
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
with some of the other new england
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
states maine and massachusetts in
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular they had already moved to
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing so there were some
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that got kind of caught up
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
where they were following
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing if they operated
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
in let's say they operated in maine new
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire massachusetts well two of
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
those three states were market-based
 
01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
those three states were market-based
sourcing

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
and a few taxpayers got caught up with
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
not shifting to cost of performance when
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
they filed here in new hampshire
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
now that we're consistent
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
in all three states and other states in
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
new england are market-based sourcing
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is more
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's easier for taxpayers to comply
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
because it's consistency and uniformity
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
across the states so it's hard when you
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
make the move in the first instance if
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're the first state to move to
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing you really have to
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
go out there and make sure that
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are following the correct
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
apportionment but when you're towards
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
the later end like new hampshire it's
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
really just creating consistency and
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
uniformity amongst the states so it's a
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
lighter lift on the part of the
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
department to proactively find those
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
businesses but we certainly are doing
 
01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
businesses but we certainly are doing
that

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh in looking at the most recent revenue
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
estimates from lba we know i noticed
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
that business profits is tracking well
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
above plan business enterprise is
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
tracking significantly below
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
is that a normal
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
pattern for this time of year based on
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
filings and so forth or is that
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
something we need to be concerned about
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
no i would say that it
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's not something to be overly
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
given our new revenue information
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
management system or rims we're better
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
allocate bet and bpt to the appropriate
 
01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:23.430 align:start position:0%
allocate bet and bpt to the appropriate
buckets

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
buckets
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
so historically what would happen is
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
most revenue would come into the
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
department and would be kind of marked
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
as bpt and at the end of each month
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
we would split that revenue based on the
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
historic split right a bet and bpt
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
now with rims
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
better way of doing that so let's say an
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
estimate payment comes in and there's
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
just one dollar amount on it and it's a
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
we split that million dollars based on
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
the historic percent but when the return
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
let's say that million dollars was
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
mostly bpt because it's a large
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
multinational corporation they don't
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
have much of an enterprise value base
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire will shift that
 
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.070 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire will shift that
back

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the actual amount per the return and
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
so what that has caused in filings that
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
we've received up till this point in the
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is we've seen more
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
businesses as you could see where that
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
the slope of those lines were different
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen that there's really been a
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
shift more towards bpt than bet than
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past i think once
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
returns start to come in in march and
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
april that will will taper off a little
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
bit and and bet and bpt will come a
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
little bit closer to plan so i think it
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
is just a timing issue but it's
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
partially due to kind of a change in how
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to allocate the revenue to
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay i'll just close with a couple
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
slides that i included to just kind of
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
give you um a picture of where we are
 
01:30:58.159 --> 01:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
give you um a picture of where we are
today

01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
so this slide historical revenue trends
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
just kind of puts everything on one page
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh really what you will see here
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
while at the beginning of the pandemic i
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
never would have guessed this but for
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
our tax types due to covet or during the
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
the course of the pandemic over the past
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
almost two years our tax types have
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
either remained flat or have increased
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
obviously at the start of all of this i
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
was estimating significant decreases in
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
our revenues and that just didn't come
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to fruition so for the the tax types
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
shown here you can see it's either been
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
flat over the course of the pandemic or
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
the next slide highlights what mr kane
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
was saying earlier you'll see for fiscal
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
year 22 we've included actual revenues
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
through december through the first six
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
months of the year
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
we've included
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
the first six months of plan and then
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
how they performed versus plan so you'll
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
see business taxes we're up 16.9 percent
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the head over plan through december m
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
r is up 30 percent
 
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.270 align:start position:0%
r is up 30 percent
um

01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
ind up 21
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
but i'd
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
shift your attention to the last column
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
where it shows what the last six months
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
of plan are compared to total plan
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
first let's look at ind
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
ind in the second six months we're going
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
to bring in 75 76 percent of had a
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
percent of plan
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
so for ind i would just say we've only
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
got even though we're halfway through
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
the year only 25 percent of the revenue
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
has come in
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't put too much weight on our
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
variants to plan at this point because
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our revenue is
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
still to come
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
you'll also see generally the rest of
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
the taxes are about 50 percent
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the first half of the year 50 in the
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
second half of the year
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
but m r and rhett
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see those taxes are closer to 40
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
percent and that's due to a slowing that
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
we typically see in those taxes during
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
the winter months
 
01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:06.629 align:start position:0%
the winter months
um

01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
there it does not appear to be a slowing
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
in ret for january uh revenues based on
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
december transactions but that may still
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
come again with m r we do tend to see m
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
r kind of taper off either in the winter
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
months or during mud season
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
when tourism isn't as strong
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
so just just something to note that the
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
plan is not necessarily evenly split
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
between the first and second half of the
 
01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.550 align:start position:0%
between the first and second half of the
year

01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then lastly just to be thorough
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
there are a few taxes that dra
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
administers that i didn't cover today
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
but want it to be thorough and include
 
01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:40.950 align:start position:0%
but want it to be thorough and include
them

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
the medicaid enhancement tax the nursing
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
facility quality assessment railroad and
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
private rail car tax
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
excavation tax timber tax and the
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
one note on the medicaid enhancement tax
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals are required to file with the
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
dra a non-binding estimate as of january
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
15 and that estimate was approximately
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
284.7 million
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty strong estimates
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that is all i had happy to answer
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the question was with respect to the
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid enhancement tax agreement that
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
was reached with the hospitals that is
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
fully implemented now and we're just
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
nope and the rate has stabilized so we
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
are yep through that whole process
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
are yep through that whole process
sure

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't put this in the calendar but
 
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.950 align:start position:0%
we didn't put this in the calendar but
uh

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%

four thousand five hundred holders in
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty one and so it's about
 
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.590 align:start position:0%
fiscal year twenty one and so it's about
180

01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
180
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
we simply go to a government council to
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.149 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%

01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
so a quick update on the college service
 
01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.149 align:start position:0%
so a quick update on the college service
plan

01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
as it was mentioned introduction of the
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
trustee of of the plan
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
and that's comprised of of two programs
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
two plans the unique college investing
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
plan a fidel advisor fighting a plan
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
just a tax advantage savings accounts
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
designed for families to save for
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
college the new hampshire plan is the
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
fourth largest in the country and right
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
now has about 21 billion dollars in
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
assets under management
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
from that plan the state received an
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment that is used
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
to fund scholarships for
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
low-income new hampshire students so
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's still a very strong successful plan
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
so moving on to a quick update on the
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
seven new hampshire plan this is a
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
growing plan um it's also a tax
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
advantage savings account for and this
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
one is for qualified individuals with
 
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
one is for qualified individuals with
disabilities

01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
so these accounts can grow tax-free as
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
long as
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
these individuals can use
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
disability expenses and or expenses are
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
to improve their quality of life so i um
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
i collaborate with director chuck say on
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
right now we have a five-year contract
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
with the city of ohio
 
01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
with the city of ohio
to

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
put the host the platform for this
 
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
put the host the platform for this
program

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
and 13 other states are part of this
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
plan and so new hampshire is one of them
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
again this program is growing and new
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire residents have
 
01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.430 align:start position:0%

as of today they have opened 577
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
accounts and right now they're 5 million
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
dollars in assets under management so
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're excited that this program keeps
 
01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
we're excited that this program keeps
growing

01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to give you a quick
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
update on those programs but um
 
01:44:02.639 --> 01:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
update on those programs but um
so

01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
now we're ready to talk about the
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
state's financial condition
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
and as you all know
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
began fiscal year 21
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
with a deficit and this chart comes from
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
the annual comprehensive financial
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
report are audited statements
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
financial statements and as you can see
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
under the fiscal year 21 columns
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund began with a deficit of
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
51 million dollars
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
but as you heard over the past year
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
understood

01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
revenue exceeded expectations
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
revenues came really strong and that
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
allowed um
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
to cover obviously the appropriations
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
and additional appropriations that were
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
part of
 
01:44:52.239 --> 01:44:53.430 align:start position:0%
part of
um

01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.070 align:start position:0%
that were
approved

01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
during the
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
recent budget process and those
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
additional appropriations were added to
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and after that this day
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
finished with a surplus of about 200
 
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.109 align:start position:0%
finished with a surplus of about 200
million

01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund obviously
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
performed well as well
 
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.590 align:start position:0%
performed well as well
and

01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
this allowed
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
to transfer from the surplus to the
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so the state was able to
 
01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.229 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so the state was able to
add

01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
about 141 142 million dollars to the
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
and so that is
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
right now which is which is excellent so
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'll talk a little more about the rainy
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
day fund
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes later later in the
 
01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes later later in the
presentation

01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to show you this this
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
graph and i know you heard about all the
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
various taxes from commissioners uh step
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
but this um
 
01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
but this um
this

01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
the treasury focuses a lot on under
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
stick to rhino for a lot of reasons and
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to show you how
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
a resecular revenue has
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
increased over time and so over the last
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
as you can see since the
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
since the great recession new hampshire
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
has been able to improve revenue um
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
gradually improve the revenue
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.070 align:start position:0%
gradually improve the revenue
performance

01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
performance
the

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
the yellow or
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
orange line shows you how you know
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
the state has had you know up and downs
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
and for example in fiscal year 14
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
there was a decline of about eight
 
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.669 align:start position:0%
there was a decline of about eight
percent

01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
but then it kept increasing after that
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then in 2020 we had another large
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
decline of six percent but then
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary increase of 21 percent and
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21. so prior to fiscal 21
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
and since the since the great recession
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
the state had on average grew about one
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
percent and then again fiscal year 201
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
was extraordinary and this is
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
clearly was thanks to the um
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal policy and monetary policy um
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
accommodations that
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we saw at the federal level
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
the entire country benefited from that
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
our economy benefit that and the state
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to our cash flows so
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
our typical um
 
01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
our typical um
um

01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
typical liquidity
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and nutrition we oversee approximately
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh between 200 and 900 million dollars
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
in cash uh in fiscal year teamwork we
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
sold cash receipts of about 8.7 million
 
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.070 align:start position:0%
sold cash receipts of about 8.7 million
and

01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
disbursements of about 8.2 billion
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
and that is from
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
payments to vendors payroll state
 
01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.709 align:start position:0%
payments to vendors payroll state
programs

01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
distribution to municipalities etc we
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
also pay for banking cost
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
and by statute we are required to invest
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
excess liquidity anything that we don't
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
um that is not used for operating
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
expenses we
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
we invested in short-term instruments so
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
for that with the low interest rate
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
environment that we have right now
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the most part we use interest
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
bearing accounts and some mutual funds
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
indicates that we need to preserve the
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
value and save to the principal provide
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient liquidity for financial
 
01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.470 align:start position:0%
sufficient liquidity for financial
operations

01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
and obviously optimize our the rate of
 
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
and obviously optimize our the rate of
return

01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that typical cash that
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
we oversee
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
um we also trustees in footage areas of
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
about over 50 trusted consortial
 
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
about over 50 trusted consortial
accounts

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.229 align:start position:0%
accounts
and

01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of fiscal year 21 that was
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to the additional cash
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
that we received um
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of the
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
coin i.t pandemic
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
we began
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
our typical cash flow changed
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
significantly with with the amount of
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
money that we received
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we started with the 1.2 billion that
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
were received from a cares funding
 
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.709 align:start position:0%
were received from a cares funding
and

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that was at the end of
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20.
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
canada year 20
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
the additional properties the
 
01:49:19.199 --> 01:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
the additional properties the
coronavirus

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
coronavirus
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
supplemental appropriation was also
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
approved and that's when we saw the
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
first round of emergency rental
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
assistance program the era one money for
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we receive another
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
we receive 179 million dollars
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
then the rescue plan was approved
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
and we received the second round of
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
money and that was 46 million dollars
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't receive the initial allocation
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the homeowners assistance fund we
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
received five million dollars to start
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
with and that was designed to start and
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
that was uh foreign expenses
 
01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
that was uh foreign expenses
and

01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
the second allocation is
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
actually arrived today so i'll talk
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
about that in a moment
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then we receive the 497 million
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
dollars relative to the state and local
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal recovery funds
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
we also received 56 million that was
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated for municipalities and
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
non-entitlement units that funding was
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
received in june and it was distributed
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
to municipalities
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the fiscal year the
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
first few weeks in july
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
but we're not done we're still in fiscal
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
year 22 we're expecting
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
an additional 122 million for the
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
capital projects fund that we apply for
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
we are also expecting
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
the remaining allocation of the era 2
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds that's 69 million
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
today we actually received 45 million
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is the remaining allocation of the
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner's assistance fund
 
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.030 align:start position:0%
homeowner's assistance fund
and

01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
around may we're going to get the second
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
tranche of the state and local recovery
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
funds and that's going to be about 500
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.070 align:start position:0%
funds and that's going to be about 500
million

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
so we received about 2 billion dollars
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
in federal assistance
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
so at some point of another our cash
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
flow was increased by about a mil but a
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.149 align:start position:0%
flow was increased by about a mil but a
billion

01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.159 --> 01:51:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
during

01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
the care at the end of fiscal year 21
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
the cares
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
the state has spent about 690 million in
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
cares funding so the money came in and
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
and it was used for all the various
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
programs that were approved
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
all the various
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
self-employed as you all know
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
assistance to municipalities assistance
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
to colleges universities hospitals all
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
the various programs that were approved
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we're designed
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
by policy
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
just simply changed you know the amount
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
of operating cash that we've been
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
handling um
 
01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.550 align:start position:0%
handling um
we

01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
kept the cares money in a separate bank
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
account just because we were not sure
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
how the u.s treasury was going to
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know we weren't sure if the typical
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
requirements that cash management
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
improvement act requirements were going
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
to apply so we kept that we weren't sure
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
if we need to return interest back to
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
the to the u.s treasury but the
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines came out later they said no
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to return the fund the
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
interest um for the care's money we kept
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
in a separate account and that's where
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
it is but when when the art money was
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
approved then knowing that um the funds
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
were going to be treated the same way as
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
the cares money we decided to start
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
adding that to our pool cash and so
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
every time the fiscal committee approves
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
and accepts those fundings we move it to
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
our pool cash
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so this jar what is showing
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
if you can see the fiscal years
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can see well
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is 27 um 18 19. our typical
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
cash is pretty predictable is based on
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the collection of our taxes is based on
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
the time and if we need to make
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
statutory payments so as you can see
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully able to see that we had some
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
years that with lower levels of cash
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
what is pretty predictable
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
typically the decline the lowest level
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
of or cash position is
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of december that's when we
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
had to disperse
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
all of the payments to municipalities
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
for meals and rooms we have to pay
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
funds and aid to
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
citizen towns and catastrophic aids so
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's a that's when we are again those
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we have our largest largest
 
01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.870 align:start position:0%
that's what we have our largest largest
disbursements

01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
disbursements
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then the time tax season comes and
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's when we see uh increase in
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
revenue but um as you can see if you if
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
you are able to look at the green line
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is um that is fiscal year 20. so we
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
started with our cash position was very
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
strong at the beginning of the fiscal
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:03.510 align:start position:0%
strong at the beginning of the fiscal
year

01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
and as a pandemic head and around april
 
01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.709 align:start position:0%
and as a pandemic head and around april
time

01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the tax deadlines were moved
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
we could see how our cash was decided to
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
decline at that moment so fiscal year 21
 
01:54:14.719 --> 01:54:15.990 align:start position:0%
decline at that moment so fiscal year 21
started

01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
with less cash than typical and that's
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
the darker blue line
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
um but again with the additional revenue
 
01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.990 align:start position:0%
um but again with the additional revenue
performance

01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:26.790 align:start position:0%
performance
and

01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
additional additional revenue that we
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
have been collecting and how we are
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
moving all the federal fund into
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
our operating accounts you can see how
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year again fiscal year 21
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
finished really strong again the darker
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
line of
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
the darker blue line
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
the red line is showing
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
which right now our cash levels are
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
about right now about about a billion
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
dollars but it reached about
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
1.4 billion
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
so let's bring this to our cash reserves
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
um so as i mentioned earlier the state
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
was able to add a 142 million dollars to
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund so we now so now the
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund has 257 point million
 
01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.870 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund has 257 point million
dollars

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
um rsa
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
nikola 13
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
e provides us a tour framework how this
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
how much we can add to the rainy day
 
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.109 align:start position:0%
how much we can add to the rainy day
fund

01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
so subject to limitations any surplus at
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
is to be transferred to the rainy day
 
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
is to be transferred to the rainy day
fund

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum allowable amount is 10 of
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues for the most
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
recently completed biennium and that
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
as you'll know that changed during the
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
budget process um house bill 2 had an
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
essentially increased the cap
 
01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.030 align:start position:0%
essentially increased the cap
um

01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
how much we can add to the reign of the
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
funds so it would it moved it changed
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
from 10 percent of our receipt to random
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
revenue for the most recently completed
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to the most recently
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
completed biennium so essentially
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
doubling the capacity of how much we can
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
add to the rainy day fund
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
so um you know with 3.3 billion in
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue for the biennium
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
the cap right now is 236 million dollars
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
with a balance of 257.8 million so our
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
capacity right now is about
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
7.7 percent
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
so this is um
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is the rating agencies typically
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
support uh maximizing the amount that we
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
can enter in the fund so um i can see
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
how this will be a credit positive
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
and

01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not unique um
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know increasing the the reserves
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
most states were able to do that some
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
states in the country don't have a cap
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
and they were able to add more than 10
 
01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.390 align:start position:0%
and they were able to add more than 10
percent

01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
but all over the country that
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
states had strong performances they were
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
able to add to the rainy day fund the
 
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
able to add to the rainy day fund the
way

01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
this slide just talks about the
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
mechanics of
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
funds can only be transferred out if the
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
conditions are met if there is a budget
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
deficit that occurred for the most
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
recently completed biennium and also if
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
under situated general fund were in
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
revenues for short of the budgeted
 
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
revenues for short of the budgeted
amount

01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.310 align:start position:0%
amount
the

01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
the it has to be the lesser of the
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
budget deficit or revenue shortfall
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
so the comptroller has to request
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
permission of the fiscal committee of
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
the governor and
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
the transfer is made and if transfers
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
out of for any other reason need to be
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor and two-thirds
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
so this just this just graph is trying
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
to show you
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
how the rainy day fund has changed over
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
so duran so from 2012 through 2014 the
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
rainy day balance the rainy day fund had
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
9.3 million dollars
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
then it increased to 22.3 million
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
and in 2016 it increased
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
to 93 million and then
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
again in 2018
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was 110 million in 2019 it was 115
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
million to stay there
 
01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.350 align:start position:0%
million to stay there
also

01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
it remained that way
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 and again
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
the significant change that occurred
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to our debt management
 
01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.270 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to our debt management
program

01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
program
and

01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
as of june 30 the state had about one
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in bonds outstanding
 
01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:07.870 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in bonds outstanding
600

01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
600
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
695 million
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
was relative to our geo bonds and that
 
01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.070 align:start position:0%
was relative to our geo bonds and that
is

01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
compared to fiscal year 20 we had
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
741 million outstanding
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
as you all know we should bonds
 
01:59:22.719 --> 01:59:23.589 align:start position:0%
as you all know we should bonds
to

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
finance our capital projects
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
and this borrowing is backed by the full
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of this state
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
of those year bonds 70 of
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the debt service is made from
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general fund revenue any
 
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.950 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general fund revenue any
other

01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the debt services pay
 
01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.390 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the debt services pay
with

01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated sources of funding
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
so we use a rapid amortization schedule
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
we typically we we pay those um
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
in 20 years and we pay 60
 
01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.109 align:start position:0%
in 20 years and we pay 60
of

01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
our principal and during the first 10
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
years and the rest is paid in the final
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
the last time we issued bonds was in
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
december of 2020. at that time we issued
 
02:00:09.629 --> 02:00:09.639 align:start position:0%
49.5 million of geo bonds and
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
37.5 million of geo refund bonds and at
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
that time we we achieved present net
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
present value savings of approximately
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
11 million so
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
during the time we welcome the
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
additional cash that we received
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
we are getting ready to issue more bonds
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
and this we're planning on a sale in in
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
march of this year so we're working uh
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
so we also work with the department of
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
department transportation transportation
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we oversee the turnpike revenue
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
bonds and at the at the end of fiscal
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
there were 271 million dollars
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding of those bonds this debt
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
service has paid from turnpike uh total
 
02:00:54.159 --> 02:00:56.229 align:start position:0%
service has paid from turnpike uh total
revenues

02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
and also we oversee the the garvey bonds
 
02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the fiscal year as
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
75.8 million were outstanding it is that
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
service is pay from federal highway from
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
funds received from the federal highway
 
02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.470 align:start position:0%
funds received from the federal highway
administration

02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
we also have bonds authorized at an
 
02:01:14.639 --> 02:01:15.510 align:start position:0%
we also have bonds authorized at an
issue

02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
of 573 million and of that is
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
224 million relate to
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
this graph is just showing how our debt
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
is trending lower and
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
is as the reason as i mentioned
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
we use a rapid amortization schedule
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
also we haven't we haven't issued bonds
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
since december 2020
 
02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.790 align:start position:0%
since december 2020
and

02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
for uh the turbine bonds they uh also
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
haven't they have an issue bonds in
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
several years they had a refund then in
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
2019 they don't have plans to issue any
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
more bonds at this moment and so um they
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
just keep paying their service and
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's how we're seeing
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
their debt levels are trending lower and
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh clearly um
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
seen as positive by the rating agencies
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
credit rating agencies
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
with our low
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
so as you'll know our borrowing as
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
largely influenced by the
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
the state's created rating
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
evaluate and assess sustained financial
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
conditions different the
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
financial operations of the state
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
and they focus on particularly on the
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
levels of the rainy day fund
 
02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:53.510 align:start position:0%
levels of the rainy day fund
how

02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know if how the budget is managed if
 
02:02:55.679 --> 02:02:56.790 align:start position:0%
you know if how the budget is managed if
it's

02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
a balanced budget
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
and how the states manage their ability
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
to control those um
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
those the spending
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
they also look at um
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
i guess on that on the prior point and
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
they typically look at for example right
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
now the the rating agencies will be
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing how the state
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
manage all this additional funding that
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
we receive from the federal government
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
they want to see that one-time revenues
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
are used for one-time expenses and that
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
additional revenues are not increasing
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
the programs that could create budgetary
 
02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.910 align:start position:0%
the programs that could create budgetary
pressures

02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
pressures
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
so similar to right now the rating
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
agents are interested in seeing how
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
states manage their medicaid programs
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
with increased eligibility um obviously
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
they could there could be some budgetary
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
pressure pressures and now some of the
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
assistance that the medicaid program has
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
received from the federal government
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
when that stops the additional funding
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you know it is important to it will
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
be important to to
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
to see how the state manages that the
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
case loads and in
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
and again to to prevent any budgetary
 
02:04:04.239 --> 02:04:06.149 align:start position:0%
and again to to prevent any budgetary
pressures

02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
pressures
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
they also look at the the pension
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
post-atomic benefit obligations and
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
their funding levels
 
02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:13.189 align:start position:0%
their funding levels
the

02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
have seen that new hampshire has
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
improved the way the pension obligations
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
have been funded
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
they were pleased to see that the
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return with more
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
realistic expectations and how there is
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
a discipline in how the state plans to
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
fund the unfunded liability over the
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
next 18 years and again they have seen
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
lot of funded liability again is that
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
discipline that they look at how new
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire could achieve the ultimate
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
goal of paying that unfunded liability
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
so they look at stability and diversity
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
of revenue sources new hampshire has a
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
strong mix of various
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
taxes it doesn't rely on one or two
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
taxes like other states do so this is a
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
strong point for new hampshire
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
when one tax is not performing well then
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
there are others that that have been
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
able to um
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
just like we saw in fiscal year 21 meals
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
in rooms
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
was not performant as well but then we
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
have business taxes that took care of
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
our concerns and in
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
and again they look at you know how the
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
states manage
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
in in difficult times you know how
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're able to manage revenues
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
expenditures and their reserves so um
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies were curious to see
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire was going to manage
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and how
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know during the economic downturn
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire was going to manage
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
the expenses so through executive order
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.109 align:start position:0%
 
froze

02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
froze
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
hiring and there were
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
there were reductions in spending so
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
while the economy was recovering
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that new hampshire was
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
able to control their spending
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
is also what the rating agencies see and
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
in in their observing and they like to
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
see that the states can manage that
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
so there's been increased interest in
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
how states manage cyber security risk
 
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:27.910 align:start position:0%
how states manage cyber security risk
and

02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
whether the states are prepared for
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
cyber attack ransomware
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
they want to know how how strong and
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
want to hear a little more about how
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
prepared states are and if there are if
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover that you know if it's
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
too expensive can they afford that
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so again another point they just want
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to see that a state in
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
issuers are not
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know their economy is not impacted
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
because of you know an event of this
 
02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
because of you know an event of this
nature

02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
and recently they've had increased
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
interest in in
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
what is environmental social and
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
governance factors the esg factors
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
they look at this at the global
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
level because they rate um
 
02:07:14.719 --> 02:07:16.149 align:start position:0%
level because they rate um
globally

02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
globally
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so in terms of states issuers
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
states are strong they have a strong
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
governance and social
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
convictions so there's really not a lot
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
of concern there's transparency states
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
have transparency so that's not compared
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
to other countries uh obviously is that
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
not a concern in terms of what the
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
rating agencies uh in their view but
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
there but in their but they're what's
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
what's evolving now is how the
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
scientists see the environmental piece
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
which relates to how states are prepared
 
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:48.709 align:start position:0%
which relates to how states are prepared
to

02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
respond to disasters um
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
events of you know that nature
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
how they're going to transition from
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
carbon to
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and how that's going to
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
impact economy so anything to do with
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
with those points
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
they've always considered that and but
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
they're just most recently they are
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
assigned to
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
formalize their methodology what they
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
call the esg methodology so we're seeing
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
that more and more
 
02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:21.109 align:start position:0%
that more and more
so

02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:21.119 --> 02:08:21.669 align:start position:0%
so
the um

02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the current um
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
the current look by the rating agencies
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
of the public sector is stable they
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
believe that what all these stimulus and
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
funding all the states have received
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
they are being able to
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
just like we saw in new hampshire are
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
able to manage the economy the finances
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
be able to um
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
perform for well
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
and um right now some of the uh the
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that they are
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
raising is how states are going to
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
manage for example covet variants you
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
know how per house how the states are
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
going to continue to manage to spend
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
them and how is that going to impact the
 
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
them and how is that going to impact the
economy

02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
also how the states are going to respond
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
to these this inflationary
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
pressures and
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
the ongoing supply chain issues
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
the labor force challenges and so they
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
want to be able to see how the state is
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
is managing that in particular in new
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire they're concerned about the
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
demographic trends
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
how this shrinking
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
working age is is is really going is
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
going to impact
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
this state's economy they have been
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring that for several years and
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that obviously the
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
state needs to
 
02:09:38.159 --> 02:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
state needs to
keep

02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
being mindful of those of those
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
pressures that could impact
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
so this is the current ratings and um we
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
haven't been formally reviewed since the
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
last time we issue bonds that was in
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
december 2020 so with
 
02:10:00.719 --> 02:10:01.830 align:start position:0%
december 2020 so with
just

02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
the public information that is available
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies were able to affirm
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
our current ratings and we have we
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
continue to have strong
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
strong ratings and
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
again we'll be evaluated pretty soon
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
when we get it ready to
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
for our bond sale and so we'll have
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh they're gonna we're gonna have the
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have conversations with
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
the rain age disease and talk about all
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
the various things
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has done over the last
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and and some of the
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
initiatives that were included in in the
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
budget and some of the
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
again the successes of new hampshire
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
and so we'll try to do our best job
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
several state officials and myself
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
participate in this call so we'll do all
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
we can um to highlight all the good
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly i just wanted to add
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
the dashboard many of you are familiar
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
with this this dashboard i just wanted
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
to mention that that's updated on a
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
monthly basis i update that on a monthly
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
basis and we post that online so
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
if you ever want to know of our cash
 
02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.390 align:start position:0%
if you ever want to know of our cash
position

02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
or anything about our
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
bond level um bonus standard levels and
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
ratings is that's what's um captured
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
and and that concludes my presentation
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
for today i'll be happy to answer any
 
02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:39.669 align:start position:0%
for today i'll be happy to answer any
questions

02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
before we take any questions
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning we talked about the
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund with the legislative
 
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund with the legislative
budget

02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
officer and then
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
02:11:58.239 --> 02:11:59.669 align:start position:0%
the dra
and

02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
it indicates on your thing
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
257 to 257.8
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars rainy day
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
which is the same with as they use
 
02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
which is the same with as they use
but

02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
money in our hands
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
from the ppp loans that were taxed
 
02:12:25.679 --> 02:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
from the ppp loans that were taxed
that

02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
changed the law in house bill 2 and that
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
money is going to have to be refunded it
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
could be up to 100 million dollars
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
such thing as credit carryover
 
02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:42.069 align:start position:0%
such thing as credit carryover
which

02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
in not so many years has gone from about
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
and neither one of these things are our
 
02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.109 align:start position:0%
and neither one of these things are our
money

02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
but they
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
figure into the
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
should there be a note
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
on your state financial condition
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the rainy day fund at
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
about the credit card over and the
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
ppp loans
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's a great question i think um because
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
and this is this is a current statute
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
because there was a surplus that's why
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state was able to add those you know
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
that additional funding into the rainy
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
day fund
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
so if i would i would imagine that if
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
though if the funds that your you just
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned needed to be returned it would
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
have to be in you know as part of the
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
budget and so that will impact
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
essentially the next biennium and that's
 
02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
essentially the next biennium and that's
what

02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't have to we don't have
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
a deficit that will you know ultimately
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
impact you know how much the rainy
 
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
impact you know how much the rainy
defunct

02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
defunct
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
could have
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
so it really is a budgetary
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's not um it will be a budgetary
 
02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
it's not um it will be a budgetary
impact

02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
what will impact the amount that we keep
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
in our reserves
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay so that
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
the budget would show it as the revenue
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
went back to the owners
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
and then that would show a negative
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
effect eventually so to reduce the rainy
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
day fund in the future right if there is
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
a deficit yes it will have to come from
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
but i think it will have to be until the
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
end of the next biennium just according
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
to statue unless there is you know this
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
this one time you know the only other
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
the governor and and the legislature
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
will have to approve
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
taking money out of the rainy day fund
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not at the end of the
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
biennium and in the meantime
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
use that rainy day fund
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
good ratings
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
it is a good thing i have to say that
 
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.109 align:start position:0%
it is a good thing i have to say that
questions

02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair madam treasurer
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
great job um
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
so we know i think we've established
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the rainy day fund's a real
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
important factor for uh bond ratings
 
02:15:24.159 --> 02:15:25.270 align:start position:0%
important factor for uh bond ratings
but

02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i've heard these presentations over
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
a bunch of years
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
and it's well established but this first
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
time i've heard about cyber security
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
can you just touch on that a little bit
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
as to what the state is doing in that
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
area that would be helpful
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
united technical maybe we have the i.t
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
people at some point tell us what's
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to say that perhaps i'm not going
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to give you the right answer
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
but my understanding you know the
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
department of information technology is
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
working with
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
governor's office and to strengthen
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the security of our systems
 
02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:59.270 align:start position:0%
obviously the security of our systems
and

02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
i believe the state has insurance for
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
that i know that can be very expensive
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
there are times that
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
honestly right now at this moment i'm
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
not really sure the status of insurance
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
but i know that's also part of that
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
concern and we typically you know
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
we when we prepare our information
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
statement when we're getting ready to
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
issue bonds we update the section of
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
cyber security and
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner usually participates
 
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
and adds information the current
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
information so we're currently working
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
to update that information but it is
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
important to
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
obviously there are pieces that we can
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
completely um disclose for secure
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
reasons but they
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
but we just need to show enough
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
information to say that we are
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
prepared to to handle
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.469 align:start position:0%
do we have
representative

02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
back here
 
02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:04.790 align:start position:0%
back here
hi

02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
on well two procedural things first
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
i hope gen 4 can send us the color
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
version of these slides because they're
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
follow otherwise
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
digitally she doesn't have to do it on
 
02:17:19.439 --> 02:17:20.629 align:start position:0%
digitally she doesn't have to do it on
paper

02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:17:20.639 --> 02:17:21.589 align:start position:0%
paper
on

02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:17:21.599 --> 02:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
on
and

02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if you'd restore
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
sending us a quarterly dashboard
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
right you don't have to produce this
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
economic analysis that the previous
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
treasurer was doing
 
02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:36.469 align:start position:0%
treasurer was doing
but

02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
sure so on what i wanted to
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm glad my colleague asked the question
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
about the ppp and this and the credit
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
carry forward i don't know if that's
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
affect your cash availability
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
if it
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh if most of that hundred million from
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
the ppp for instance uh got had to be
 
02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
the ppp for instance uh got had to be
refunded

02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
refunded
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
02:18:04.479 --> 02:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
uh in
in

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
may june i think it'd have to be done by
 
02:18:08.399 --> 02:18:09.349 align:start position:0%
may june i think it'd have to be done by
uh

02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
uh
but

02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
on the other question i had was
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
i was here
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
for the great recession
 
02:18:17.519 --> 02:18:18.309 align:start position:0%
for the great recession
and

02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of stimulus money that
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
went out for too short a time
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
and it was tied to a lot of federal
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
regulation which this one is also
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the the executives set up a system
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
which i think the treasury was involved
 
02:18:37.519 --> 02:18:38.629 align:start position:0%
which i think the treasury was involved
in

02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:38.639 --> 02:18:39.910 align:start position:0%
in
that

02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
that
on

02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
on
helped

02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
helped
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
reporting correctly and the agencies of
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
the state reporting correctly so that we
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get in trouble with the feds
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
is there something like that going on
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.359 --> 02:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
so um i know for example um
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
they go for office and who are mainly
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
managing this grant so we we we have
 
02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
managing this grant so we we we have
been

02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
um the treasury we we have been applying
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
for those grants
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the way we've been managing this
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
addition all this fun you know all this
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal financial assistance that we're
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
receiving is for the most part the go
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
for office is
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
managing the program itself and the
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
compliance piece
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
so collaborating with you know the
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
gopher office
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit the treasury and
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrative services because they
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
also look at
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
for audit purposes
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that we all
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
obviously in compliance with all the
 
02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.710 align:start position:0%
obviously in compliance with all the
various

02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
various
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
requirements of this program so yes it
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is all part of if this will be will be
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
audited as part of the signal audit that
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
the state goes through
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
so i i know for for certain that all of
 
02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:06.550 align:start position:0%
so i i know for for certain that all of
those

02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
regulations and i know the governance
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
office also is involved with reviewing
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
the regulations to make sure that we are
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
managing this funds
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know the way it was intended in the
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
in the the federal level
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the federal statute
 
02:20:21.359 --> 02:20:23.110 align:start position:0%
with the federal statute
um

02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
you had a separate question well i think
 
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
you had a separate question well i think
um

02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
you're correct so so if we if we see
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
funds that are going to be dispersed
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
because we're collected and all of a
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
sudden we we have cash that we shouldn't
 
02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
sudden we we have cash that we shouldn't
have

02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
obviously that could impact our cash
 
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
obviously that could impact our cash
position

02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
what i have to say right in our cash
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
position is so strong that i am not
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
concerned if we if we lose a few
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
of course that's going to change over
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
time as as we are bringing all of these
 
02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.230 align:start position:0%
time as as we are bringing all of these
federal

02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
funds and we pull them with our cash we
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
we have the advantage to
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
really um you know just as such we just
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
have all this extra cash that we're not
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
that concerned
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
about liquidity we had those concerns
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
back in december we december 2020 um
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
the beginning of fiscal year 21 was a
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
difficult year for us we were concerned
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we were not going to have enough
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
funds to pay our obligations
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
we were concerned that we need to borrow
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
money we didn't want to borrow money
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that was a period of time that we had
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
to watch our liquidity but right now we
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't have that situation
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
again the funding that we receive from
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it did
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
the only difference between this one
 
02:21:43.349 --> 02:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
time with all the stimulus that we see
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
we received and
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
any other program is that we receive all
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
this funding up front so now we have all
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
this cash the government for government
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't function that way they
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
usually say you spend the money then
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
we'll reimburse you after this time was
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
completely different it was with a clear
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
intention to inject economy to bring the
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
economy back to how i was before
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the national level at the state level
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
and it did work um as we could see it
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
the way we see it so
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
again i'm not as concerned if we have to
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
spend some money just because it was a
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of a glitch from some of
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the treatments
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
of some programs
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
i think i answer your two questions
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
saying monica thank you very much thank
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
you i just want to add one more thing i
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
would like to say um with all the
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
federal funding that were received
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
obviously we're going to have a strong
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
cash position for
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
for some time but that clearly is going
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
to change as the state agencies um start
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
spending that money so things are going
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
to change i would say
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
by the end you know
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 24 all the money needs to
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
be spent or it needs to be obligated by
 
02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
be spent or it needs to be obligated by
20

02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
december 2026. so um again probably we
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about you know in
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of cash we don't have a lot to
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
worry about but as the obviously our
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
cash position and our
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
net cash flow will change over time and
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
we just
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
obviously will continue to watch that
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that's all thank you very much
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%

good to see you

02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot has happened since the last time
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
we got together
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the economy and everything
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's been going on so it's good to
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of an update i
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
know after i think later on today you're
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from employment security and
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
bridge slavers and his group
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
i should point out before i start we
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
work very very closely with obviously
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
with employment security as well as with
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
the treasurer's office the governor's
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
office and everyone else but uh
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
employment security and our department
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
have really in terms of managing what's
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
been going on over the last couple of
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
months and keeping track of the data and
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
all that it's been a very much of a
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
shared experience
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i think you'll probably be able to
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
see some continuity between what i'm
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to talk about here
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
in my presentation and what you'll hear
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
about from commissioner capacity deputy
 
02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.550 align:start position:0%
about from commissioner capacity deputy
commissioner

02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
later on today
 
02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:47.110 align:start position:0%
later on today
so

02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
ba has been very much involved in
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
everything that's been going on since we
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
hit the pandemic now almost two years
 
02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.309 align:start position:0%
hit the pandemic now almost two years
ago

02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to kind of give you a
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of a flavor
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
oh i'm gonna scroll like this
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
about one of the major components
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
of what we've been up to over the last
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
year and a half now is the development
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
of an economic recovery strategy that is
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
i can do it for you i can double team i
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
can i can do the whole thing i
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
if anyone can hear me i'll just keep
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
just stop
 
02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
just stop
um

02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i think when we do
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
let's go back two years we're really
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
looking at a pre-pandemic situation
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
economically speaking in the state that
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
was really quite good
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
we were seeing very low unemployment
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
rates we were seeing heavy investment a
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
lot of business activity
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth we hit
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
right about march of 2020 and everything
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
just started to really change
 
02:28:00.399 --> 02:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
just started to really change
and

02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
what we had been up to up to that point
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
is really working on
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
a long-term economic development
 
02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.429 align:start position:0%
a long-term economic development
strategy

02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
but once we sort of saw what was
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
beginning to happen and where we thought
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
things were going to go and what
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities and challenges that were
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to be facing us
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
going forward we felt we had to realign
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of that operation that's a little
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
bit of what i wanted to talk to you
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
about today so here is um obviously that
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
very shocking graph of our unemployment
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
rate and what happened in uh march and
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
april of 2020 where we jumped to a 16
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
nationally that's the other line at 14.7
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then over the course of the last uh
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
now almost year and a half we've seen
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
just an incredible reduction of that
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't tell the whole story
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
as many of you are well aware that we
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
still have labor force shortages going
 
02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.550 align:start position:0%
still have labor force shortages going
on

02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot behind this data
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government which is
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for this data
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
really doesn't change a lot of the way
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
that they calculate that and it's pretty
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
standard been going on for many years
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
a good harbinger a good way to see sort
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
of how we're doing against other states
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
but in my view it's not always the best
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
indication as to what's actually
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
happening in our
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
workforce so one of the things as this
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
all began was we felt very strongly that
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make investments quickly
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
and efficiently into the state economy
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
to sort of shore up what we were seeing
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
happening particularly with our small
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
business community and this is jumping
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
back again a little bit two years but we
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
had it's important to remember that
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
there were two
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
major tranches of recovery and relief
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
funding that came to the state
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
a good portion of that obviously was for
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
and for all of the
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
initiatives and programs that had to be
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
funded in order to fight and covet and
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
are continuing to do so
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
our department
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
really was focused on what are we going
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
to be doing with those resources as it
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
relates to the economy and the
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
investments that we need to be making in
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
those respects so under cares act which
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
came in spring of 2020
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
that was 1.25 billion dollars as you'll
 
02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
that was 1.25 billion dollars as you'll
recall

02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
roughly a little less than half of that
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
money ended up going into
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
i can go to the next slide going into
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
business support specifically and we
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
moved pretty quickly with things like
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
the main street relief fund and the self
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
program and the there was the gap
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
program and we had a program
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for non-profits
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
just basically to get some resources out
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
to our employers early into this
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic we were one of the first states
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
really to be able to do that and i think
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know when you look at that number
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
that graph that i showed earlier and how
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
quickly that
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
that unemployment number started to dive
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
back down i think a lot of that had to
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that we were able to
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
keep a lot of businesses
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
not all of them of course but a lot of
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
businesses in a lot of sectors
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
functional and able to continue to
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
employ people
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
as we move towards the
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds which came in just about
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
a year ago now
 
02:31:15.270 --> 02:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan funds those
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
have a much longer
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
horizon to them as monica pointed out we
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
have until 2026
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
to fully expend those resources
 
02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the cares act which was
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
really initially at least just a couple
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
of months they did extend that deadline
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are on fiscal
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee agreement are well aware
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
until for an additional year but
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
these funds are going to be good going
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
out until 2026. so that does change the
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of the flavor of those
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
resources and has put us into a mode of
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
really being able to focus on what are
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
the specific long-term one-time types of
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
investments that we could be making that
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
could be fundamentally valuable to our
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
employers to our economy
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
for many years to come not just within
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
the most immediate need that we have so
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
if you look under american rescue plan
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
here on this slide we've broken it down
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
into a couple of areas where thus far
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and government council
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
and gopher and all of the parties
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
involved in that effort
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
have authorized funds along the lines
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
thus far with these numbers about 28
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars of that going to
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
economic development
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
roughly about 20 million dollars so far
 
02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
has gone to workforce development
 
02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:28.309 align:start position:0%
has gone to workforce development
initiatives

02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
and uh the the 30 million dollars that
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
you see there for broadband and cyber
 
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.510 align:start position:0%
you see there for broadband and cyber
security

02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
that has gone but that number is going
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
to grow very very substantially
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of months and i'll
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
probably get a chance to talk about that
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
so going back to what i mentioned
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
earlier what we really wanted to be able
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
to do was get all of the see these
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
resources see what the needs were out
 
02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
resources see what the needs were out
there

02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
go through a process
 
02:32:57.270 --> 02:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
of really getting back out to
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders partners businesses get an
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
assessment as to what the situation is
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
there what are the needs how have they
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
changed substantially if at all
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
from pre-pandemic conditions and boil
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
that down into a number of really basic
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
plans and strategies that we have put
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
forward called the economic recovery and
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
expansion strategy this was issued on
 
02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
expansion strategy this was issued on
our

02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
back earlier this year in 2021 and it
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
has served as a lot of the basis for the
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
activity of ba and the department
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
working again with employment security
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
and our other partners in state
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
government but also it has given us a
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of a road map and a strategy
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
to follow as it relates to the american
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
rescue plan
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
proposals that we've been putting
 
02:33:41.359 --> 02:33:45.030 align:start position:0%
proposals that we've been putting
forward

02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
there are five basic goals under the
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
we'll call it the aries plan economic
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
recovery strategy
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
number one of course is the labor force
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
retain and recruit a modern workforce
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
our economy has been on a trajectory now
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
of a really sort of highly experienced
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
highly qualified highly educated uh
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
positions or where we're seeing the
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
highest growth whether that's in health
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
care whether that's in technology that's
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
the type of entrepreneurial startups
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing uh and so on and so
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
forth so a lot of our activity has been
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
how do we find those individuals how do
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
we get them to new hampshire how do we
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:24.870 align:start position:0%
keep the
the

02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
labor force that we do have that
 
02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
qualifies into that into those
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
categories and assist our employers in
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
their need to be able to continue to
 
02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:33.910 align:start position:0%
their need to be able to continue to
grow

02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
grow
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
one way that we do do that and is
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
connected to
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
the first point there is the what we
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
call the connecting of new hampshire's
 
02:34:42.389 --> 02:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
world-class tourism assets to town
 
02:34:42.399 --> 02:34:43.429 align:start position:0%
world-class tourism assets to town
recruit

02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
so this is tourist tourist to town
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
basically we really and i feel pretty
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
strongly that uh you know our tourism
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
industry which has been you know pretty
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
well ravaged during 2020 but showed some
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
extreme strength this past year and i
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
have some data on that
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
before we're done here today but
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
that really serves as an entry point for
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of people to fully understand
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
what is it about living in new hampshire
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
what are the quality of life in
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
components that really are appealing to
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
the demographics that we're seeking to
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
be able to draw to new hampshire
 
02:35:17.439 --> 02:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
be able to draw to new hampshire
and

02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
the best to the extent that what we're
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the demographics that we have
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
traditionally sought in new hampshire
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
has been sort of that younger family
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
people that are maybe in their second or
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
third job
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a place to raise a family or
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
to really increasingly
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
look for that work life balance
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
which i think we have seen an increase
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the audience that is receptive to
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
those uh those marketing appeals
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
and there have been some pretty
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging numbers along those lines i
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
know that there's
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
often a lot of discussion around various
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
components of our
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
demographic trends one though that i
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
certainly like to highlight is the fact
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
that if you look at our net migration
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
numbers over the last several years the
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers of people that are coming to
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire versus the number of
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
people that are leaving we've been on
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
the upside of that now for about five
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
years uh and each year it grows a little
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
and in fact this year
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
2021 i should say
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
we saw that number grow to 13
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
hundred again
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
not a huge game changer not gonna
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
fill every position that we have open in
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
the state but really to continue to see
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
that positive trend moving in a
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
direction and again and i would say that
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
also within that within that group a
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
good 75 to 80 percent of that 13 000 are
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
within let's the 25 to 40
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh age range which is really that's what
 
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're targeting so
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
i like to sort of see that that
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of this effort that we've
 
02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of this effort that we've
been

02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
working on now for the past couple years
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
is having some positive impact and
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
putting us on a good trend
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
building resiliency in high growth
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
sectors i just mentioned this i mean we
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
see technology really growing quickly
 
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing uh healthcare
 
02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.070 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing uh healthcare
jobs

02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know we i don't need to go on about
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
the situation in the healthcare
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
employment sector right now but it's
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
still regardless of what's happening
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
under cobit it's going to continue to
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
grow as it was pre-pandemic
 
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
providing us that entree into new
 
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.429 align:start position:0%
providing us that entree into new
hampshire

02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
and whether it's restaurants or whether
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's tourist attractions whether it's
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
hotels those are huge employers in our
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
state and we need to be and we're highly
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
the efforts on those sectors
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
technology i mentioned in construction
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
construction industry was growing
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic again
 
02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
as we start to see the infusion of funds
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
coming from the federal infrastructure
 
02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
coming from the federal infrastructure
legislation

02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
that will start showing up here at some
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
point soon
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue to even put
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
more pressure on the labor needs of that
 
02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
more pressure on the labor needs of that
industry

02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
and so again those are there's five
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
those five sectors are where we're
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
really heavily focused
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
the entrepreneurial component
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
state we are seeing large numbers of
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
business formations not just in new
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire but
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
across the united states
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has always been a place
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's been open to
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
new startups new businesses
 
02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
new startups new businesses
entrepreneurism

02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurism
 
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
working closely now increasingly with
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
our university system to help facilitate
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
more of that activity giving students
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
coming out of our undergraduate
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
institutions an opportunity to stay in
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and open a business in new
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire by solidifying some of those
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
relationships that they have and some of
 
02:38:40.399 --> 02:38:41.190 align:start position:0%
relationships that they have and some of
the

02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
programs that are offered at those at
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
our universities is very much
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
part of this aspect of our strategy
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
and then the role of infrastructure
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think i need to go in too much
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
about that obviously roads bridges and
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
so on but included in this increasingly
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and where we're seeing investment in uh
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
some of these federal resources that are
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
coming into the state they're in water
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
and sewer
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
which is critical i mean there are areas
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the state that still don't have
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
adequate water sewer for
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to manage the growth that
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're seeing or that they're seeking
 
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to have and then broadband
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
is very much part of this
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
broadband right now
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
the state under uh american rescue plan
 
02:39:22.399 --> 02:39:23.190 align:start position:0%
the state under uh american rescue plan
is

02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
going to see an infusion of around 122
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars for broadband
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
implementation across the state it's
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on unserved and
 
02:39:34.469 --> 02:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
underserved areas
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to fundamentally change
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
the landscape
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
once we're able to start moving programs
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
and moving those funds
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
out into our communities to make those
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
changes and to get the state wired up
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
because it's really hard to participate
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the economy in the 21st century if
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have high speed access to the
 
02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
you don't have high speed access to the
internet

02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
so excuse me i've started to get into a
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of that here are some of the
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
main areas that are obvious to those of
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
us who work in this space business
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
retention keeping the businesses that we
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
have in the state continuing to work in
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
our business attraction area business
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment and expansion we have a
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
whole team that works on this on a daily
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
basis and this is work that has changed
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally as a result of the
 
02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:20.389 align:start position:0%
fundamentally as a result of the
pandemic

02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:40:20.399 --> 02:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
pandemic
virtual

02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment of companies to come to new
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a new thing and all states
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
are learning how to i think adapt to
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that uh we're trying to stay very much
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
ahead of that curve and have made some
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
investments to try to keep our team able
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
to compete
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
for businesses looking to expand just
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
a business can expand in just so many
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
different ways now it doesn't need to
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily buy a huge new facility
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
move a facility to a new state they can
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
seek workforce they can seek
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
labor across the country now with remote
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
working and
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
virtual access to the labor markets
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
which is really changing the landscape
 
02:41:07.269 --> 02:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
out there as to how all of this work uh
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
workforce development we've talked about
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship technical assistance
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
was something that bea was heavily
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
involved with throughout the pandemic
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
working with businesses working with
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
communities to try to make sure that
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
people were getting the assistance they
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
needed and if they had questions or if
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
they needed some guidance getting them
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
to those resources
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
either within state government or
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise has been something that our
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
staff at va has been very heavily
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
financing obviously infrastructure
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy and regulatory piece there is
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
one that i wanted to harp on a little
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
bit because
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is an area that i refer to as the
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
economic development infrastructure in
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
i think if i go to the next slide
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that we're instituting
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
a new way to adapt to
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
all of the changes that i've been
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
talking about here has been through our
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative economic development
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
regions which we've been working on as
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
part of the re strategy to set up across
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
the state to provide regionalization
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
of a lot of these strategies that we've
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
been talking about here
 
02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
what nes what the strategies and what
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
the priorities are for a seacoast based
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
economy are quite different than what we
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
would see in the upper valley or in the
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
north country and we want to be able to
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
have some ability to work with so many
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
of our partners out there whether
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're planning commissions whether
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're development corporations whether
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
they're individual communities
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
employers and so on
 
02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to adjust the specific needs
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
that they're seeing in those regions and
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
so this is a little bit of an overlay
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i know many of you work in the space
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
now there's a lot of different regions
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and a lot of different boundary lines
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
already out there across the various
 
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
state agencies but for the purposes of
 
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
economic and community development i
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
think that in making some change to the
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
economic infrastructure that we use to
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
sort of deploy resources and to
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
address the issues that
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as really critical to the
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
growth of our economy having the
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
capability to do that on a regional
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
basis is pretty critical
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
this is one of our longer slides with
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
some of the information as to what that
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
these cedars are but there are four
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
the seacoast region
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have the central southern region
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
basically from concord to nashua we have
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
a southwestern new hampshire region that
 
02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
includes cheshire and sullivan county
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then our north country
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
region is just now getting underway
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
right now but they again are populated
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
with all of the organizations that do
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
this work on a regular basis to really
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
continue to help grow so some of the
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
areas where you know we might see some
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
change and some examples of how this
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
could work
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
in one one example i use a lot is in the
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
business recruitment space
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
in a lot of places now if you're a
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
business or you're the state and we're
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking to help business move into an
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
area of the state
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
the capability and the capacity in
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
different areas of
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire is quite different
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times that either falls
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
specifically on
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
an individual community or it falls
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
specifically on
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state as the driver for that
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
activity and for those uh
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
communications it takes a lot of
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
investment to get a company to make a
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
decision to move to a certain area of
 
02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
the state with the cedars in place we're
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
able to work with
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce training components that
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
are there because that's usually what
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
businesses are looking for access to
 
02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:35.830 align:start position:0%
businesses are looking for access to
workforce

02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
work with our community college outlets
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
with our university system partners that
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
are within those regions to come up and
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
formulate a holistic strategy to help
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
bring those businesses to that area that
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
are otherwise it was a pick and choose
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
sort of as you went along
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
the collaboration
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
in this state is so critical and it is
 
02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:57.429 align:start position:0%
in this state is so critical and it is
really

02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
something that i often hear about from
 
02:44:59.279 --> 02:45:00.630 align:start position:0%
something that i often hear about from
businesses

02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
who are going through the experience of
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
considering moving to new hampshire that
 
02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're able to get access to and be
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
able to see collaboration among so many
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
different parties in the state
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a big reason as to why they
 
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:15.269 align:start position:0%
and that's a big reason as to why they
ultimately

02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
may or may make a decision to come here
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire so
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
instituting that to me is a really
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
critical part of what we're able to do
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
i had mentioned a little bit of how
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're beginning to use some of our
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
tourism assets to address the issues of
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
workforce availability in the state
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
and you know here we've got from play
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
here to stay here
 
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
everyone's got a catchy slogan as to how
 
02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.710 align:start position:0%
everyone's got a catchy slogan as to how
these

02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
programs can come together but as i
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned we are seeing some
 
02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:49.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned we are seeing some
some

02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
results from this that are very positive
 
02:45:51.279 --> 02:45:52.070 align:start position:0%
results from this that are very positive
and

02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of small examples here
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
i can provide these to you uh through
 
02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
links so you can see them in bigger up
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
close on your on your computer screens
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
but we have taken a lot of the tourism
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
assets that we typically use to
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
for that industry and for that purpose
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
and translated them into how do we get
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
those individuals to recognize that you
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
know if the places that you like to go
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
kayaking or skiing on the weekends
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot fewer people there on
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
tuesday afternoons and you can really
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
you can take your kids skiing during the
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
week or you can have that quality of
 
02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:27.110 align:start position:0%
week or you can have that quality of
life

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
component that really is driving so many
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the decisions that people are making
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
across the country as to what does their
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
post pandemic work life experience
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
looked like so we're trying very hard to
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
take full advantage of that
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
as much as we can
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
a couple more ads here
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
these are our tourism ads for this
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
winter and for last summer
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
there is a uh i could send you some of
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
our tv ads i was going to play that here
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
today but i'm betting that that's
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
probably not going to work if i try that
 
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
but the last couple of slides here are
 
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
really on the fact that just earlier
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
this week
 
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.190 align:start position:0%
this week
we

02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
we announced that 2021 was a
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
record-breaking year for tourism in new
 
02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:10.469 align:start position:0%
record-breaking year for tourism in new
hampshire

02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
we saw more people come to the state of
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
the course of 2021 than we've seen any
 
02:47:14.399 --> 02:47:15.349 align:start position:0%
the course of 2021 than we've seen any
year

02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
previous and in fact summer 2021
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
set a record for a single season
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
total visitor spending was over 2
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in just the summer
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
and that was true across the entire
 
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
state it wasn't just in the white
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
mountains it wasn't just in the seacoast
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
it was in every region of the state
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think you know we could
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
pontificate about many different reasons
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
as to why that may be
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
but uh i do know that we made a very
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to not entirely leave a
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the marketing and advertising
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
that we had been doing during the
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic we did not abandon key markets
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
we stayed in there and said things like
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
you can't come right now but when you
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
can we're here and we're ready for you
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
we stayed front of mind in places like
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
new york and connecticut and rhode
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
island and other key in massachusetts
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
and key markets and i do think that that
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
led to a little bit of our capability to
 
02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
draw those individuals to new hampshire
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
when we came out of the box and we knew
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be a competitive
 
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
summer when we get to the point of
 
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
having vaccines in place and having
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
people feel safe
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to get out and explore i
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
would also say another huge component of
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is the access to the outdoors and
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
the outdoor recreation component of this
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
any of you up in the white mountains
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
area or in the lakes region
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
or in the seacoast saw the number of
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
people that were getting outside last
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
summer was very substantial
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
it creates a whole new set of challenges
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it is taking what
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
is one of our strongest assets as a
 
02:48:50.230 --> 02:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
state and putting it to work
 
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
for our tourism industry but also
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully as i said integrating that
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
into our long-term workforce strategy
 
02:48:59.349 --> 02:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the numbers that
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
we had
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 21 five and a half billion
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of total spending
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
generating about 323 million dollars in
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
tax revenue uh through
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
meals tax
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that is a return on investment so
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that we spent in
 
02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.150 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that we spent in
marketing

02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
for this on behalf of the state we saw a
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
return in tax revenue 12
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
and 8 cents
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
and in the summer specifically we had
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
2.1 billion so almost half of that
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
spending was in the summer uh with four
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
almost four and a half million visitors
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire during that period of
 
02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:36.070 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire during that period of
time

02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
so i went through a whole bunch of stuff
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
there but i really wanted to give you a
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
sense in a bit of a lead into some of
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
the some of the data that you'll see
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
from rich and george later
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
on specifics around labor markets and
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rates and the
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust funds
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
and give you a sense of the overlaying
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
strategy and what we're doing
 
02:49:57.990 --> 02:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
with them and with our partners
 
02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
to help continue to manage our economy
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
and see it grow over the next couple of
 
02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
and see it grow over the next couple of
years

02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take any
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner questions for the
 
02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:15.110 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner questions for the
commissioner

02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh rep senator geider followed by
 
02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:20.830 align:start position:0%
uh rep senator geider followed by
representative

02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
elmir you commissioner taylor for for
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is one about
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
demographics of the 25 to 40 year group
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to bring in
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh is it safe to assume they're looking
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
for this cedar type collaborative
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
process regionalized throughout the
 
02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.990 align:start position:0%
process regionalized throughout the
state

02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
is that is that attracting more than we
 
02:50:44.150 --> 02:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
would if we didn't do that
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
or is it too soon to say
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
well the cedars have been in place
 
02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:49.670 align:start position:0%
well the cedars have been in place
for

02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
more than a year at this point but what
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's doing so for example
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
up in the upper valley area
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
we've been working really closely with
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
the chamber in that region and
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
they have instituted a lot of these same
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
sorts of strategies where they've
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
typically been very business oriented
 
02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:10.150 align:start position:0%
typically been very business oriented
chamber

02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're looking at ways to utilize some
 
02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the tourism marketing programs
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
and they're but they're not using them
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
specifically to attract tourists they're
 
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
using it to integrate into their
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
business recruitment and to share that
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
with their employers
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
and with their members so that they can
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
also use that
 
02:51:30.389 --> 02:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's a good point that i should also
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
just elaborate on briefly is some of the
 
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
resources that the department of
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs is
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
receiving under the arpa fund and under
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
through the eda has been to create a lot
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
of these types of creative assets that
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here whether they're high
 
02:51:46.399 --> 02:51:47.510 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here whether they're high
quality

02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
quality
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
photographs or they're high quality
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
videos that typically are beyond the
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
reach of a local chamber or a local
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
business really a small business that
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
wants to recruit individuals we're going
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
to open source all of that out all of
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
that material so everyone will be able
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
to pick and choose kind of what works
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
pictures of any number of different
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
activities and different positions so
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of excited about that because
 
02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
it'll give the chambers and the cedars
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
and the employers
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to pull down some of
 
02:52:18.309 --> 02:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
those resources that the state is
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
apologies i've got a couple of questions
 
02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:34.870 align:start position:0%
apologies i've got a couple of questions
on

02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
first on because you were just talking
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
about the cedars i do not understand how
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
you're dividing them up where is the
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
upper valley
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
the upper valley is in the southwestern
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
cedar maybe
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
southwest with king
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay that's weird
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
what are at least our biggest problem i
 
02:53:11.349 --> 02:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
think the biggest problem across the
 
02:53:11.359 --> 02:53:12.230 align:start position:0%
think the biggest problem across the
state

02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
is where do we house workers
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they come
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
to look at a job and then they leave
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford our cost of
 
02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:26.070 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford our cost of
housing

02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
and when they do afford our cost of
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
housing they get they
 
02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:32.710 align:start position:0%
housing they get they
evict

02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
evict
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
our essential workers that are that are
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to those people's
 
02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
necessary to those people's
comfort

02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
i haven't really heard anything
 
02:53:48.399 --> 02:53:49.429 align:start position:0%
i haven't really heard anything
trying

02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
trying
 
02:53:49.439 --> 02:53:51.830 align:start position:0%
trying
to

02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
increase

02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
secondary schools
 
02:53:59.359 --> 02:54:01.110 align:start position:0%
secondary schools
and

02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
technical colleges in construction
 
02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
technical colleges in construction
in

02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:07.349 align:start position:0%
in
repair

02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
repair
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
in all of the trades that go into
 
02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
in fact in claremont just a few days ago
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
they took away half of their tech
 
02:54:24.710 --> 02:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
center's budget
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
they have a tech center we don't we have
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
to go to vermont
 
02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring that into a
 
02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:31.030 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring that into a
question

02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
so that that
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
question is are you going to are you
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do something about this
 
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
about housing
 
02:54:40.479 --> 02:54:41.670 align:start position:0%
about housing
about

02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.269 align:start position:0%
about
on

02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of people who are
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
going in into construction
 
02:54:49.279 --> 02:54:50.790 align:start position:0%
going in into construction
and

02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
the trades that keep housing
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
going well and also buildings for
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
businesses yes ma'am so there's there
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
are a number of
 
02:55:03.269 --> 02:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
programs that are in existence right now
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping to amplify we're still
 
02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the process this is under the arpa
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
investment process
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
around workforce and workforce training
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
those programs have not you know
 
02:55:18.389 --> 02:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
been fully proposed yet so but i can
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that there is intention to get
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
initiatives to include
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
the ability for employers to train their
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
existing employees but also
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
programs that will allow individuals to
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
seek the type of training that they that
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
they feel they want to have for their
 
02:55:37.359 --> 02:55:38.630 align:start position:0%
they feel they want to have for their
career

02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
career
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
on specifically on the trades program
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is some discussion around how can
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
we make some investments of arpa
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
resources to help
 
02:55:48.630 --> 02:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
grow the capability for local high
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
schools to really expand their opera
 
02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:52.469 align:start position:0%
schools to really expand their opera
their

02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
offerings in that space either in
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
partnership with an existing training
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
school or program or on their own so
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
those are i would say in process but i
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
would say that the issues that you're
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
raising i would acknowledge entirely
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
whether it's housing or whether it's
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
training or whether it's a workforce
 
02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
training or whether it's a workforce
component

02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
component
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
as it relates to
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
any issues around
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty paying rent
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have the emergency rental program
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is now almost about to cross 90
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of investment made
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
of federal resources under that program
 
02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
through the new hampshire housing
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
finance authority so if there are
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
instances where you have constituents or
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
others who are in that situation
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
we should get them to the new hampshire
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority to that
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
program because it is designed
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically for that purpose but yes
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
let me just acknowledge all the things
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
that you said around housing and
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
training and so on and say those are
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
very much part of our broader strategy
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of real life on the ground
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
where are we going to make investments
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
those decisions are underway right now
 
02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:55.030 align:start position:0%
those decisions are underway right now
yeah

02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
if i could on that one
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
we need a
 
02:57:02.230 --> 02:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly strong culture change
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
because we have been teaching the
 
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
parents and the students for 40 years
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they should go to college and they
 
02:57:12.070 --> 02:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
should work with their minds instead of
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
with their hands and that's the way it
 
02:57:16.469 --> 02:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
was put
 
02:57:16.479 --> 02:57:17.750 align:start position:0%
was put
it's

02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:21.670 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
but

02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:24.150 --> 02:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
if we don't have housing we aren't going
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
to have people
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
i couldn't we just and the
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
in in lebanon
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the hospital is now trying to
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
cannibalize the high-tech
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
workforce by
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
locking up
 
02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:43.030 align:start position:0%
locking up
on

02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
bids on apartments
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the area because they're about to add
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're hitting on the key point which is
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
the availability of housing
 
02:57:58.469 --> 02:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know up in your area i know we're at
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
like zero percent one percent vacancy
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
rates it's not that different in other
 
02:58:04.389 --> 02:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
a healthy vacancy rate in a healthy
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
housing environment is in a three to
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
five percent range so i think a lot of
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
what we're aiming to do strategically is
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
to move us in that direction how do we
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
increase the availability of housing
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
and what are the investments necessary
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
and what are they what is available
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
under the federal regulations to take
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of this moment in time to make
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
some of those one-time investments
 
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
that move us in that direction
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you can i ask one
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
totally different question
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
which is a question go ahead thanks
 
02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
which is a question go ahead thanks
uh

02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:41.950 --> 02:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
how can we find out what the other
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
322 million dollars that have already
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
been allocated in our are
 
02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
you go to the gopher website and you
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there's we keep an updated
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
list of all of the programs and charts
 
02:58:58.150 --> 02:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
and everything about how that
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
is being obligated right now but there's
 
02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:01.870 align:start position:0%
is being obligated right now but there's
no

02:59:01.870 --> 02:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
categorization the way you've done for
 
02:59:05.830 --> 02:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
these other three
 
02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:07.030 align:start position:0%
these other three
programs

02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
i believe there is some categorization
 
02:59:10.389 --> 02:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
in what's up there right now
 
02:59:10.399 --> 02:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
in what's up there right now
okay

02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:16.389 --> 02:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:16.399 --> 02:59:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
representation

02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for the
 
02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for the
presentation

02:59:25.030 --> 02:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking i i've
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
as a landlord i've run into actually a
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
couple new tenants who have come from
 
02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
places like
 
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
new york actually two of them from new
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
york and both of them are motivated to
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
leave new york and come to new hampshire
 
02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:39.590 align:start position:0%
leave new york and come to new hampshire
for

02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
safety reasons they see new hampshire as
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
a safe state
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we talk about that
 
02:59:46.950 --> 02:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
much we talk about you know the beauty
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire you know all the things
 
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we should be talking about the
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
beauty of new hampshire
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
things that we can do here live play
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
work and so forth
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to potentially it may
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
be already doing this does it make sense
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
to start pushing the safety aspect of it
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
especially as we see craziness going
 
03:00:05.110 --> 03:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
around in several
 
03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:06.950 align:start position:0%
around in several
cities

03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
cities
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately new hampshire has remained
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
a fairly safe state and i guess the
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up is also
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
business leaders or anyone
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's thinking about new hampshire ask
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
you about you know the safety aspect of
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
this game
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh that does certainly come up and i
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
think there's an implication i think a
 
03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
lot of the marketing
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we are doing
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
really sort of draw out what is unique
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire
 
03:00:37.110 --> 03:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think there are other states certainly
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
that would fall into the same category
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
as being viewed as safe i think vermont
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
probably remain typically states that we
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
compete with for these very same
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh individuals and workforce and so on
 
03:00:48.399 --> 03:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
uh individuals and workforce and so on
so

03:00:49.670 --> 03:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the strongest of
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
delineators but it is something that is
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
certainly i think recognized i hear a
 
03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the same sort of thing um
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's a little bit implied in
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
some of the type of advertising that we
 
03:01:05.910 --> 03:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
do but again we're trying to draw really
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
what's unique about new hampshire
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
because when it comes down to it you
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
know it's in new hampshire is it maine
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's in vermont
 
03:01:14.389 --> 03:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
is it montana
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
what what really sort of gives us that
 
03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:17.030 align:start position:0%
what what really sort of gives us that
pitch

03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%

03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%

04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
the only security i have right now for
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
being able to trust brian on advancing
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%

04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
advance the slides for him
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%

04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to get started i'm going to
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about recapping our
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
experiences over the last few years
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic with what we've been
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
paying out who's who's been utilizing
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program i'm going to
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the experiences
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
of employers with their tax rates as
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
they fund our unemployment compensation
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
system as we all know and talk a little
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
bit about the trust fund where it is at
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
and what we are forecasting over the
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
next few years and then i'll hand it off
 
04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
to brian to talk about trends in labor
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
force and what he sees happening
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
and all of the the tools that he
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
regularly looks at and reviews
 
04:07:28.150 --> 04:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
and talk about
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
what he thinks will be happening with
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of this year
 
04:07:34.150 --> 04:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to the the first slide
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
um so this you can see um what we've
 
04:07:40.389 --> 04:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
paid out um in comparing what we paid
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
out during the pandemic uh calendar
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
years 20 and 21 just over 2 billion
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
dollars across all federal and state
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment programs
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
compare that to the prior 15 years
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
we where we exceeded that
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
in just that short period of time so
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
2021 paid out more benefits than we did
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the 15 years prior
 
04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
now i've heard
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
from a lot of folks that have
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
attributed that
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the fact that there are a lot of
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
additional federal benefits being paid
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
out and we can see in the next slide
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
here that's certainly the case
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
most of what we paid out was in the form
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
of one of the federal programs that we
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
administered on behalf of the federal
 
04:08:30.080 --> 04:08:31.349 align:start position:0%
administered on behalf of the federal
government

04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have an alphabet soup here of program
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
names but you can see in our top line
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
here the f-puc program which was the
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
program that paid additional benefits on
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
top of red gram so that was started off
 
04:08:46.870 --> 04:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
as an additional six hundred dollars a
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
week and ended as an additional three
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a week that was over a
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in benefits that were
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
paid out here in new hampshire just in
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
that program alone our red bar here is
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the payments from our state unemployment
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
comp trust fund so that was about
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars that came out of the
 
04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
fund directly financed by new hampshire
 
04:09:07.279 --> 04:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
fund directly financed by new hampshire
employers

04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
employers
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
pua was the federal companion program to
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
that where we paid just about 343
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
million and then these other two
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
programs both federal programs
 
04:09:19.279 --> 04:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
programs both federal programs
that

04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:20.080 --> 04:09:21.110 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
make up the balance of that just over
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars paid
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
now when we look at the next slide we
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
can see that not only did we did new
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire receive a lot more
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits during those two
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
years compared to our prior 15 but when
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
we look at the number of unique
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that relied upon the
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment system
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
during 20 and 21 we compare that against
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
2019 not really much of a comparison
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
against 2019 right
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
where we had nearly 176 000 individuals
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
that relied upon the unemployment
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
program during those two years almost a
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
quarter of our entire labor force you
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
compare that against 19 where we had
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
just over 14 000 people really not much
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
of a comparison there well let's then we
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
look back over to the left of this chart
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
and we see
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
during our peak years of the great
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
recession how does that compare i mean
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
just under a hundred thousand people
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
relied upon the unemployment program
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
during the great recession which was
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
about 13 of the labor force at that time
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
so you can see not only did we pay out a
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
lot more benefits but we had a lot more
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that were relying upon the
 
04:10:32.800 --> 04:10:34.469 align:start position:0%
individuals that were relying upon the
program

04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
during our most recently completed two
 
04:10:36.560 --> 04:10:38.790 align:start position:0%
during our most recently completed two
years

04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
when we look at where we are at now and
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
how that compares to some of our
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
milestone weeks
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
over the the pandemic period you can see
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side of this chart the
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
week prior
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
to the expanded unemployment occurring
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
prior to the state entering its state of
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
emergency prior to the federal
 
04:11:01.110 --> 04:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
government passing the cares act march
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
of 20. we're at about 4 000 individuals
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
filing weekly claims for unemployment
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
benefits we quickly
 
04:11:08.560 --> 04:11:09.670 align:start position:0%
benefits we quickly
ballooned

04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
ballooned
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of of may where we saw
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
over 116 nearly 117 000 people in one
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
single week
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment benefits that
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
was our peak week during the pandemic
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see where we came down in
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
january of 21 and now where we find
 
04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves in january of 22 back
 
04:11:35.110 --> 04:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
not only below
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels for the number of
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
claimants or number of individuals
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
relying upon the unemployment program in
 
04:11:44.070 --> 04:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
any given week but we're actually about
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
30 to 35 percent below
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
where we were prior to the pandemic
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
i mean that will that's an important
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
point to remember when we get into some
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
later on slides and when brian starts to
 
04:11:57.199 --> 04:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
later on slides and when brian starts to
discuss

04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
things like quit rates and higher quit
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
rates right now none of that is really
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
translating over into higher
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims and brian will be
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
able to talk about what that means in
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
terms of the churn that we're seeing in
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
on this slide despite being messy with a
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
lot of information which i apologize for
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to show here
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
with this slide is that
 
04:12:25.110 --> 04:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
where we where we started in
 
04:12:25.120 --> 04:12:26.309 align:start position:0%
where we where we started in
21

04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
2021 in the spring of 21 and we try to
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
mark some um what we consider to be some
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
very important milestones with policy
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
decisions that were made that we feel
 
04:12:40.710 --> 04:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
have had a dramatic influence over the
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
utilization of the unemployment program
 
04:12:45.269 --> 04:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
over that period of time so you can see
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
back in in april uh when uh work search
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
requirements were announced as uh to be
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
coming back um when uh the governor
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
announced that we would be ending
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
participation in the federal enhanced
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
and extended programs
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
04:13:03.990 --> 04:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
the introduction of a return to work
 
04:13:04.000 --> 04:13:05.349 align:start position:0%
the introduction of a return to work
bonus

04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
bonus
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
so you can see what the the claim
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
behaviors have actually been
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
during that period
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
and as we move over to the right hand
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
side of the screen
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
you can see as we get to up to current
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we just recently hit our
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
20-year low
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
for the number of individuals filing for
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment during any given week
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
that was just prior to the holiday
 
04:13:28.399 --> 04:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
that was just prior to the holiday
period

04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
and now we're just under 3 000
 
04:13:31.920 --> 04:13:33.510 align:start position:0%
and now we're just under 3 000
individuals

04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
filing each week
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
when you compare that to how new
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire stacks up against other
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
surrounding states in new england
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the country as a whole in terms of
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
how quickly we have recovered when we
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
utilize the number of individuals
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing the unemplo unemployment
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
program as a metric you can see
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire being the red line in this
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
chart as it always is
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
in charts from the department
 
04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
you see that we're at about two and a
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
of our peak in terms of the number of
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
individuals filing for unemployment
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
right now as compared to that peak week
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we saw back in may of 2020.
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
when you look at that compared to the
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
u.s as a whole with the black line here
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
you can see the u.s as a whole is about
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
nine percent of their peak week and the
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
new england states at about 11 and a
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
half percent of their peak week so you
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
can see while new hampshire has had a
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
dramatic reduction in individuals that
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
are utilizing the unemployment program
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
seen the those numbers fall at a faster
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
rate compared to our neighboring states
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.520 --> 04:14:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
when we
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
hear all about the the the extraordinary
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
amount of benefits that have been paid
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary number of individuals
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
that have utilized the program
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
um we then
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
want to talk about well what has
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
occurred with regard to our employers
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
who finance
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
our unemployment compensation system
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
here in the state either are for-profits
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
who pay on a quarterly basis or are
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
non-profits who pay back on a
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basis for benefits that
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
are paid out for benefits that are paid
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
from the regular state unemployment
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
program those federal programs are all
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
financed by the federal government when
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're not charged to our employers
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
what we are showing here with this state
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
with this slide is on the left you can
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
see where our average unemployment rate
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
for for-profit
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
tax-paying employers were peaked out
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
during the great recession you see
 
04:15:44.830 --> 04:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
nearly 3.7 percent as an average tax
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
rate back in 2011 in that first quarter
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
now to put that into perspective a new
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
employer here in new hampshire they they
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
come in at a starting tax rate of 2.7
 
04:15:58.080 --> 04:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
come in at a starting tax rate of 2.7
percent

04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
they pay that 2.7 percent on the first
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
14 000 of annual earnings to each
 
04:16:04.720 --> 04:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
14 000 of annual earnings to each
employee

04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so that 3.7
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that was a was a stayed at a
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
stubborn high number
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
for quite some time after peaking out in
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
the great recession you can see when we
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
move to the right of this chart with the
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
red bar on the right hand side where we
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
peaked out during the pandemic at just
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
over 2.3 percent
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
and are coming down
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
at a much faster clip than we did during
 
04:16:38.070 --> 04:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
the great recession we can't see it on
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
this slide we missed it by a few hours
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
but we actually
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
had our q3 average tax rate number for
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
2021 which actually fell
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
from the 1.85 you see in q2 where it
 
04:16:54.149 --> 04:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
came down to 1.67
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
for q3 so continued decline in that
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
average tax rate for our for-profit
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
employers and and the reasons for this
 
04:17:02.319 --> 04:17:03.429 align:start position:0%
employers and and the reasons for this
um

04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:05.349 --> 04:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's not just it's not a coincidence
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's not just uh we got fortunate uh
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the tax rates during the pandemic
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
stayed lower than they did during the
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
great recession uh there were there were
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
several reasons for this one um and
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
something that um
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
gets uh somewhat um
 
04:17:23.199 --> 04:17:24.469 align:start position:0%
gets uh somewhat um
overlooked

04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
overlooked
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
because the main focus of
 
04:17:29.110 --> 04:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders originally issued
 
04:17:30.309 --> 04:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
at the start
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the the pandemic in march of 2020
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
were really focused on expanding
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility for unemployment benefits
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
but one of the key provisions
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
and emergency order five from the
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
governor was a
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
changing the way benefits paid out from
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
the fund were treated in terms of how
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
they were charged
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
so starting in march of 20
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
through the end of the state of
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
emergency all benefits that were paid
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
out of the state trust fund so those
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that were eligible for
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
regular state unemployment
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
those benefits were direct charge to the
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
fund rather than being charged against a
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit employer's experience
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
and also our non-profits were not
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
required to reimburse the fund for those
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that were paid out
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the impact of that is that during
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
that time period our for-profit
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
employers they had the the positive
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
influence on their tax rates and their
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
experience of taxes that they were
 
04:18:32.070 --> 04:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
paying into the system they didn't have
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
that negative experience from a from a
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
tax rate perspective of the benefits
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
being paid out being charged against
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
their experience so it had no it didn't
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
have a negative
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
effect on their rate or a positive rate
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
in that matter and driving it up so that
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
kept rates lower
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
we also had a 50 million dollar infusion
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
of cares act money that was deposited
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund helped to stabilize
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
the trust fund at the time that that
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
deposit was made our fund had fallen to
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
between 45 and 50 million million
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
dollars from the from where we started
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
at 300 million at the start of the
 
04:19:10.800 --> 04:19:12.550 align:start position:0%
at 300 million at the start of the
pandemic

04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
and what we were able to do as a result
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
of that infusion of karzak money was we
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
it prevented us from implementing a
 
04:19:20.720 --> 04:19:21.670 align:start position:0%
it prevented us from implementing a
second

04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:19:25.110 --> 04:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
0.5 surcharge on employer tax rates and
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
it allowed us to remove the first .5
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
surcharge on employer tax rates earlier
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
than we had initially expected
 
04:19:33.760 --> 04:19:34.710 align:start position:0%
than we had initially expected
now

04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
the landscape with regard to surcharges
 
04:19:37.439 --> 04:19:38.309 align:start position:0%
the landscape with regard to surcharges
and

04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
solvency controls
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
for employer tax rates that are set in
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
statute that landscape has changed since
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
then we no longer have
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
those surcharges as part of
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
the statutory solvency controls in 282a
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was a change
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
introduced by the governor and the
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill the legislature
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
kept that in
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
so those surcharges no longer exist
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
so going forward there aren't there is
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
not the possibility of those surcharges
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
being added to rates but in a
 
04:20:09.120 --> 04:20:11.349 align:start position:0%
being added to rates but in a
give-and-take

04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
give-and-take
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
type of relationship where we were
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
removing those surcharges from the
 
04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:17.830 align:start position:0%
removing those surcharges from the
statute

04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:20:17.840 --> 04:20:19.349 align:start position:0%
statute
the

04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:22.229 --> 04:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
balance thresholds at which employers
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
received tax rate reductions those were
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
also changed in order to allow the fund
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
to a higher amount a more realistic
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
solvent amount
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
during times that employers would be
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
better able to afford it rather than
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
hitting them with surcharges during an
 
04:20:37.840 --> 04:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
hitting them with surcharges during an
economic

04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
economic
 
04:20:39.120 --> 04:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
economic
downturn

04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
downturn
 
04:20:42.309 --> 04:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
so going forward there aren't
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of surcharges and unless
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
obviously that's changed and the
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislature were to change that
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
but we think that those provisions uh
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
those decisions that were made are
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
largely responsible for rates staying at
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
a at a lower peak during the pandemic as
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the recession a decade prior
 
04:21:03.760 --> 04:21:04.469 align:start position:0%
compared to the recession a decade prior
and

04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
finishing up here with with my portion
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the presentation i'll turn it over to
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
brian a couple of slides just on
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
where we are at in terms of our
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation trust fund
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
and where we are forecasting that fund
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
and also when we are forecasting those
 
04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
fund balance reductions or those
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
discounts that apply to for-profit
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
employer tax rates when we are expecting
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
those to kick in
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
this first slide is just a a shot of the
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
current forecasting tool that we utilize
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
brian and his team have put a lot of
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
hard work into developing this and why
 
04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
we want to show this to you so you can
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
with our current forecasting abilities
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
we are able to
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
move much more quickly with regard to
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
potential changes
 
04:21:57.670 --> 04:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
in moving different levers
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that have an influence over over trust
 
04:22:00.080 --> 04:22:01.110 align:start position:0%
that have an influence over over trust
fund

04:22:01.110 --> 04:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:22:01.120 --> 04:22:02.389 align:start position:0%
fund
revenues

04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
and we point that out so that you know
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you have an understanding of that
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that we can um make
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
those types of forecasts uh based upon
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
different types of policy changes
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that you might be
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
looking at and this tool is available to
 
04:22:19.840 --> 04:22:20.550 align:start position:0%
looking at and this tool is available to
you

04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
that we can utilize to assist in any way
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
with any of those types of changes that
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
you might be looking at going forward
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and again the credit for that really
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
goes to brian and his team for having
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
developed that
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
to assist with
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
accurate forecasting and doing it in a
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
quick fashion
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
and being able to take in a lot of
 
04:22:40.239 --> 04:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
and being able to take in a lot of
variables

04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
variables
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
in order to do that
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
so our slide here shows you where we
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
feel the trust fund is going based upon
 
04:22:48.800 --> 04:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
feel the trust fund is going based upon
the

04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
analysis of
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
our economic and labor market
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
information bureau
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and you can see that we're forecasting
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
to end calendar year 22 at about
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
285 just under 286 million dollars again
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
right now today we're sitting at about
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
194 million dollars
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
we are forecast to end
 
04:23:13.680 --> 04:23:15.349 align:start position:0%
we are forecast to end
2023

04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
at just under 320 million
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
and 2024
 
04:23:19.920 --> 04:23:21.149 align:start position:0%
and 2024
at

04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
354 million now going to the next slide
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
and here we are you can see in our
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
center column labeled fbr that's the
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
forecasted fund balance reductions
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
we are forecasting that the
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
the first fund balance reduction the 0.5
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
reduction to employer tax rates
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
will kick in with the first quarter of
 
04:23:47.760 --> 04:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
will kick in with the first quarter of
2023

04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is triggered by the fund
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining a balance of at least 250
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in that prior quarter of
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth quarter of 22.
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
first quarter tends to be the most
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
expensive quarter for most employers so
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
that is an opportune time
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be having that first reduction hit
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
when we look at the additional
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
reductions in statute we still with the
 
04:24:19.110 --> 04:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
the changes made as part of the trailer
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
bill that second reduction of a full
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
percent that kicks in when the fund
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
maintains a balance of 350 million
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for for a full quarter
 
04:24:31.110 --> 04:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
we expect that that will be
 
04:24:31.120 --> 04:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
we expect that that will be
hitting

04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
hitting
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
could be as soon as the fourth quarter
 
04:24:34.319 --> 04:24:35.229 align:start position:0%
could be as soon as the fourth quarter
of

04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
2024 um
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
or it could be the first quarter of
 
04:24:40.319 --> 04:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
or it could be the first quarter of
2025.

04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
you'll see in those
 
04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
2024 balances quarter ending balances
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the third
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the second and third quarter
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
you see that we are right around that
 
04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
350 million mark
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
so a few million dollars
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
here or there
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
could have a
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
an impact in terms of whether or not
 
04:25:05.040 --> 04:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
an impact in terms of whether or not
the

04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
one percent reduction is hit for that
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter or if it is delayed until
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of 25.
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
within our forecasting period right now
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're not up to the
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
level that the third and final fund
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
balance reduction of 1.5
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
would kick in that would kick in at
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
400 million with the statutory changes
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
that have been made
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
but this is where we're looking at going
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
out through
 
04:25:31.680 --> 04:25:33.349 align:start position:0%
out through
2024

04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
being said and talking about the
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
finishing up with the trust fund i'll
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
turn it over to brian and he'll talk a
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
little bit about where we are in labor
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
force trends and some of the tools that
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
he uses
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you rich
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for the
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
invitation to see many familiar faces so
 
04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's really a pleasure to be back
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
speaking before you again in a different
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
role well not quite a different role i
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
think i did this last year
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
at a at a similar time um this is just
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
the first chart is just kind of an
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the things that i'd
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
like to talk about or kind of an overall
 
04:26:14.399 --> 04:26:15.429 align:start position:0%
like to talk about or kind of an overall
assessment

04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'll get into the weeds on some of these
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
charts and i hate to lose anybody so
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
when i do lose you as i inevitably do
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
here are some of the things that i'd
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
like you to think about or take away
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
from my presentation
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
one the labor market is in good shape
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
we've got a higher number of job
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
openings than we had prior to the
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have a higher percentage of
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
jobs job openings
 
04:26:40.399 --> 04:26:41.189 align:start position:0%
jobs job openings
than

04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:26:43.830 --> 04:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
the nation overall
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
but we also have higher quit rates
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have more people leaving jobs
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
often to take other jobs
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that's helping to boost the number
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
of job openings
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
job growth has accelerated in new
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the second half of 2021
 
04:27:00.319 --> 04:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the second half of 2021
we

04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
also believe that the bureau of labor
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
statistics who does a monthly estimate
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the number of jobs in new hampshire
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
has been under counting
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
those jobs and that will be corrected a
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
little bit later this year next month
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
when we do benchmarking but we still
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
look good in in terms of our job growth
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
we think we'll get back to pre-pandemic
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
levels of employment by the end of 2022
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
also think that the u.s economy will get
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
back all of the jobs that it lost during
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
the pandemic it'll take almost another
 
04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
year or so before we get back to our
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic trend level of growth we'll
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
recover jobs that we had at uh beginning
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
of 2020 but that will kind of discount
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
all the jobs that we might have created
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
in 21 and 22.
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
the bad news is the omicron variant of
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus is clearly having a
 
04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
negative impact on labor issues
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
nationally and in new hampshire it's
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
resulted in more people not being in
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
work temporarily at least
 
04:28:06.319 --> 04:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
work temporarily at least
than

04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
than we had expected and as high as
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen throughout the pandemic
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
our labor force in new hampshire also
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
remains lower than it was prior to the
 
04:28:17.680 --> 04:28:18.870 align:start position:0%
remains lower than it was prior to the
pandemic

04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk a fair amount about that
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
it tends to be in a few
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
demographic categories that are most
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
likely to have seen a shrinkage in in
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
their labor force
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be unlikely that we
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
get back to that pre-pandemic level any
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
time soon for a couple of reasons that
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'll talk about
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it that makes it really critical
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
that we get everybody who can be in the
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
labor force into the labor force and as
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
importantly not only that but
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
we had labor shortage prior to the
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic the pandemic has exacerbated
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
those labor shortages
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
so people who are in the labor force
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to be put to their highest and best
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
use they have to be matched to the jobs
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
that are in demand
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they have to work to their full
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
potential if the new hampshire economy
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be operating at its full
 
04:29:10.399 --> 04:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
is going to be operating at its full
potential

04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:29:12.080 --> 04:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
potential
lastly

04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
ending this on a positive note
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that has been most
 
04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
optimistic to me over the past year is
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that the net in migration into
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from other states more
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
people moving into the state than moving
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
out of the state
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
has just taken off
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
this past year we were back to 1980
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
early 1990 levels of net in migration
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
about twice what i had forecast
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
about this time last year
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that has real positive ramifications
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
for both our labor force
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
and our demographic challenges that we
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
face next slide
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
so this is just a quick chart showing um
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
the monthly job postings
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the state and as you see at the very
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
end here we've had some ups and downs
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
but overall the trend is more job
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
openings than we saw
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic and that's not an
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
epiphany to you folks you can't drive
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
along any
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
road that has businesses on it and not
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
see help wanted signs so there's plenty
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
of opportunities out there the fact that
 
04:30:23.110 --> 04:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
we have very low unemployment rates and
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
low unemployment claims
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
is a testament to this we don't if
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
people want to work we have jobs for
 
04:30:30.800 --> 04:30:32.469 align:start position:0%
people want to work we have jobs for
them

04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the one of the reasons why we have so
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
many job openings and i mentioned is the
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
fact that we have
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
very high quit rates and this is a
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
three-month moving average i will tell
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
you that in the most recent month
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
because there's some variability so i
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
like to use a three month moving average
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had i think about the
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
fifth highest quit rate of any
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
state in the nation so as you see again
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire always the red line
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
for comparison massachusetts and the
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
gray line is the u.s you see how rapidly
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
the quit rates in new hampshire
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
accelerated and why would that be well
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's in large part well there's a couple
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
of reasons one we have a very high
 
04:31:11.520 --> 04:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
of reasons one we have a very high
percentage

04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
of employment in industries that have
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
among the highest quit rates
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
that tends to be
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
hospitality industries where people
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
change jobs a lot a lot for a lot of
 
04:31:23.359 --> 04:31:24.389 align:start position:0%
change jobs a lot a lot for a lot of
individuals

04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's their first job they move on to
 
04:31:27.510 --> 04:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
another job
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
the quit rates in that industry have
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
accelerated they have the highest quit
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
rates of any industry retail another
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
industry that has a lot very high quit
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
rates also increased we have a high
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of retail employment in
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
addition we're seeing some industries
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
that traditionally have relatively low
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
cri quit rates
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
we're seeing much higher quit rates
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%

04:31:52.319 --> 04:31:53.429 align:start position:0%
health care being among the most
prominent

04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
04:31:53.439 --> 04:31:54.389 align:start position:0%
prominent
where

04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally health care has had a
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
below average quit rate now they're
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
about at the average but the percentage
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
increase is about 50 percent so a 50
 
04:32:05.110 --> 04:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
percent increase in the quit rates in
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare and it makes sense those
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
industries are industries that one
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare burnout hospitality
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
you know it was very difficult during
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic to have face-to-face
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
contact you were asked to do a lot you
 
04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
were asked to
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
enforced social distancing
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds people were not particularly
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
nice during the pandemic many of them so
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i you could see why the the quit rates
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
would rise next year
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is just a chart that depicts where
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
we came from in terms of employment in
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and where we are now
 
04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
the blue line is where employment total
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
employment in the state was heading
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic you see just at
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
the very end a little dip that was one
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
month or two months so i wasn't
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
particularly worried about that although
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
we were expecting that growth was going
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
to slow a little bit even prior to the
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic you know we were running into
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
real significant labor shortages prior
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic hits and that's the red line we
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
lose a hundred and twenty thousand jobs
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
hundred twenty thousand either
 
04:33:06.400 --> 04:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
hundred twenty thousand either
temporarily

04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
most of them temporarily some of them
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
permanently we bounce back very quickly
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
at least a percentage-wise and then we
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
saw kind of some variability fits and
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
starts you know we it looked good in the
 
04:33:20.480 --> 04:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
starts you know we it looked good in the
summer

04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
my second wave hits later in the year we
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
see again
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
you know slow down in job growth
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
but we're back on the right path and
 
04:33:30.480 --> 04:33:31.349 align:start position:0%
but we're back on the right path and
again

04:33:31.349 --> 04:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
my view is and i'm i'm
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
100 confident that the numbers here will
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
actually be higher when we get the
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
benchmark revisions we're actually
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
adding more jobs so we're my belief is
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
80 percent back or 85 percent back um to
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
the pre pandemic levels of employment
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
and we should finish that off um to 400
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
percent by the end of the year
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
and this is a very nerdy chart it is
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
also my favorite metric for assessing
 
04:34:03.359 --> 04:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
also my favorite metric for assessing
where

04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the labor market is
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of people look at
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate which is a really
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
fine metric
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
and other people look at the labor force
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
participation rate and say that's their
 
04:34:16.639 --> 04:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
participation rate and say that's their
preferred

04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
metric we know that labor force
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
participation has been down
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we know that the unemployment rate
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
is back to where it was prior to the
 
04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic but does that mean
 
04:34:32.230 --> 04:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we're back to full employment does
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
that mean that our economy
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
you know every everybody's working
 
04:34:39.750 --> 04:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
at the same rates they were before no
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
i take a look at the labor
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
the employment the population ratio
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
among the group of individuals that have
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
the highest labor force participation
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
rate individuals 25
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
to 54. those are people who participate
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
in the labor force at the highest rates
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
of any anyone about 90 percent of people
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
in those age groups are
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
are working or are in the labor force
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so anytime new hampshire is at about 85
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
percent that means we're basically at
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
full employment
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
and you can see times when we've dipped
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
below that
 
04:35:14.240 --> 04:35:15.590 align:start position:0%
below that
recession

04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
recession
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s and this is a
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
12-month moving average so
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
they give you some perspective it's not
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
a a actual monthly average 12-month
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
moving average during the great
 
04:35:26.160 --> 04:35:27.349 align:start position:0%
moving average during the great
recession

04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
recession
 
04:35:29.910 --> 04:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
it dipped well below
 
04:35:29.920 --> 04:35:31.029 align:start position:0%
it dipped well below
so

04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
here and also dip very the thing that i
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
find really interesting about this chart
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't dip even though we know we had
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
a 16 unemployment rate at one point
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
our employment to population ratio among
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
this age group 25 to 54 prime working
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
age years
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
really didn't
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
change much from a time period when we
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
had six or seven percent unemployment
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
rate during the great recession why
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
04:36:06.639 --> 04:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
would that be
well

04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
it explains who was
 
04:36:09.760 --> 04:36:10.789 align:start position:0%
it explains who was
who

04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't working most during
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
young people in particular because why
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're employed a lot in hospitality in
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
recreation and retail those were the
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
jobs that disappeared fastest
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
so those people are counted in this
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
in this age group so that really
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
explains it but it still says we're
 
04:36:35.760 --> 04:36:37.070 align:start position:0%
explains it but it still says we're
about

04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
1.4 percent below what i consider in new
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be a full employment
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
economy so we've still got a ways to go
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
long explanation i i love the start
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you the unemployment rate
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
is my least favorite economic indicator
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're at 2.6 percent now
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
we were at 2.6 before the pandemic we do
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
not have the same economy that we had
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
next chart please
 
04:37:04.959 --> 04:37:06.869 align:start position:0%
next chart please
again

04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
just to kind of put into perspective
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
where we are relative to other states i
 
04:37:13.830 --> 04:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
tend to focus most of my attention on
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
the private sector employment because
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
that gives me a better idea of what's
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
happening in in in the economy as
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to what's happening in
 
04:37:22.160 --> 04:37:23.429 align:start position:0%
opposed to what's happening in
government

04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
and this just shows
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
where every state is in terms of their
 
04:37:28.160 --> 04:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
where every state is in terms of their
pre-pandemic

04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
level of employment so basically
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
february of 2020 and how far below they
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
are that level of employment compared to
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
every other state
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's in the middle so you say
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
mediocre but in fact
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at all the states that have
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
gained back more of the jobs none of
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
them are in the northeast
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
the northeast was the hardest hit region
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of layoffs in terms of
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
restrictions on economic activity
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't expect we would expect
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
that we would have those states would
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
have further to recover
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire among all the northeastern
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
states and certainly among all the new
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
england states has recovered more of its
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
private sector jobs than any other state
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
i focus
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the pandemic has
 
04:38:24.320 --> 04:38:25.029 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the pandemic has
done

04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
is it has highlighted
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
the necessity to have more real-time
 
04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
indicators of economic activity and
 
04:38:33.039 --> 04:38:34.070 align:start position:0%
indicators of economic activity and
government

04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
my agency included bureau of labor
 
04:38:36.639 --> 04:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
my agency included bureau of labor
statistics

04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't produce
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
really timely data we get it on a
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and then it's a six week
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
lag or sometimes it's a quarter lag
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
so people have looked a lot at private
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
sector sources of data this is a metric
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
that i really like because it's done on
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
a daily basis and it's a cnn
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
moody's analytics
 
04:39:01.990 --> 04:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
back to normal index and basically what
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
it looks at is it says compared to what
 
04:39:05.760 --> 04:39:06.789 align:start position:0%
it looks at is it says compared to what
every

04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
each individual state their how their
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
economy was performing prior to the
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic where are they at right now
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
and it has about 20 national indicators
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
and six or seven from every individual
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
state to do that so it doesn't compare
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
state to state it just compares new
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire to itself prior to the
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic and what you see here
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
is the red line again new hampshire
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
we bottomed pretty low
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
we were operating at only 60 percent
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
of our economic activity prior to the
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic early in the pandemic we bounce
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
back quicker than the nation we bounced
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
back quicker than most states
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
massachusetts used here because we like
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
to compare ourselves so much to
 
04:39:48.240 --> 04:39:50.150 align:start position:0%
to compare ourselves so much to
massachusetts

04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
04:39:52.708 --> 04:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.718 --> 04:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
as

04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
weather changed as people moved inside
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
as virus took
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
hold and we had a second wave
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
the economy took a hit people were less
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
willing to engage in their normal
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
economic activities we dropped down we
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
improved again
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
and what happened
 
04:40:10.718 --> 04:40:11.670 align:start position:0%
and what happened
in

04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
late summer early fall of this year the
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
delta wave and the delta wave took
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh had an impact a negative impact on
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
economic activity
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
most recently
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
we had we're still we got to 99 of our
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
of our pre-pandemic level of economic
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
activity most recently you see the drop
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
there and that's related to the omicron
 
04:40:31.360 --> 04:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
there and that's related to the omicron
variant

04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
variant
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
which is clearly having an impact on
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
i this slide is a little bit out of
 
04:40:40.560 --> 04:40:41.670 align:start position:0%
i this slide is a little bit out of
order

04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
but one of the reasons why i think we
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's many reasons why i think we are
 
04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
adding more jobs than has
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
been indicated by the bureau of labor's
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
physicians one of them is this
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're adding new businesses new business
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
formations this is a chart that shows
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
the number
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
of new business formations in a subgroup
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
of businesses so every business when it
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
forms applies for an employer
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
identification number with the internal
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
revenue service and that
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
information is readily available
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
this looks at the number of employer
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
identification numbers filed in new
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a subgroup of businesses
 
04:41:23.120 --> 04:41:24.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a subgroup of businesses
that

04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
we call high propensity or higher
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're businesses that
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
when they they're not sole proprietors
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're businesses that have employees
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
they're manufacturers
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know it could be
 
04:41:35.760 --> 04:41:36.948 align:start position:0%
you know it could be
restaurants

04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's all industries and all businesses
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
that generally have very few
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
single and single employee businesses
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
proprietors but have employees
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
that number dropped dramatically during
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we expected that about we
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
expected it to bounce back bounce back
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
people who delayed
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
those filings but since then it has
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
remained elevated has and has been
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
picking up
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of entrepreneurial
 
04:42:03.200 --> 04:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of entrepreneurial
activity

04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
having looked at this kind of data for
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
20 years i can tell you any time we see
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
high levels of entrepreneurial activity
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
employment numbers get revised upward
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
these are companies
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
they start they form over they apply for
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
a number they eventually
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
eventually employ people those companies
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
do not get into the regular
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
sample the survey that the bureau of
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
labor statistic does for probably close
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
to a year
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
so all of these new activity isn't
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
showing up in the employment numbers
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
they do eventually
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of this will be
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
corrected in our benchmark maybe not all
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
of it but it's a clear indication to me
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that we'll see higher employment
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
numbers another one that i didn't put
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
here which would be redundant is our own
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
administrative records
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
um we have looking at the
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
second quarter of 2021 to the second
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2020 we had 8 percent more
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
number of businesses private businesses
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
that we're paying into our unemployment
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
insurance fund
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
so we know that there's a lot of
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial activity we know that
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of businesses that most
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
likely aren't showing up in those
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
employment estimates next slide
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
i mentioned um
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
the the impacts that the that the
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
omicron variant has had um i can't
 
04:43:25.270 --> 04:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
emphasize this enough and that you know
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a political statement but
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know getting that under control will
 
04:43:30.240 --> 04:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
you know getting that under control will
have

04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
real significant positive economic
 
04:43:33.840 --> 04:43:34.868 align:start position:0%
real significant positive economic
benefits

04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
what's happening most recently this is a
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
a survey that is done by the census
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
bureau it's been done since the early
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
part of the pandemic
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it asked individuals
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and in individual
 
04:43:48.638 --> 04:43:49.590 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and in individual
states

04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
um why they aren't if they're not
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
working why they're not working
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
and there is a particular question
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's that says that gives them the
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
choice of i was carrying caring for
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
someone or i was sick myself with the
 
04:44:02.000 --> 04:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
someone or i was sick myself with the
coronavirus

04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
coronavirus
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
this is the number of people who say
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
they're not working
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
because of that reason
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
and you see back early
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
in the in the pandemic you'd say well
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
how come those numbers weren't higher
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
well it's because so many businesses
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
were shut down that was the reason that
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
businesses opened up
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
we had a second wave as
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
winter of last year more people were
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
sick more people were caring for
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
individuals who were sick in their
 
04:44:32.320 --> 04:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
individuals who were sick in their
families

04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere over six million people
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
indicating that they were either sick or
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
they were taking care of someone
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
we get down again weather improves
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
looking really good the delta wave hits
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that number peaks up and then you
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
can look at the very end the omicron
 
04:44:49.680 --> 04:44:51.510 align:start position:0%
can look at the very end the omicron
variant

04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
variant
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
just how many people over the last month
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
have indicated that they're not working
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
because they're either sick or taken
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
care of
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
those numbers by the way
 
04:45:01.920 --> 04:45:03.350 align:start position:0%
those numbers by the way
that

04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
took off
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
just before the december
 
04:45:07.760 --> 04:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
just before the december
the

04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
employment estimates are done
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
on a survey during one week of every
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
month and it's the week that contains
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
the 12th of the month
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
the december employment report that was
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
reported early in january didn't really
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
the report for january that's going to
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
come out next friday
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
will reflect about this time period here
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
very real possibility and i don't want
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
to go out on a limb but it's a very real
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that the nation will report
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
no net job growth
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
for january largely because of that i
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but i bet the number is
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to be very low now new hampshire
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
produces these the survey is also done
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire tends to be a very
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
small sample so it bounces around so i
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put it on here but i will
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that the magnitude of increase
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
is similar even if it's not the exact
 
04:46:01.840 --> 04:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
is similar even if it's not the exact
number

04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
just another indication of what we're
 
04:46:08.550 --> 04:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
the the coronavirus and how i look at
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
what impacts is having this is a measure
 
04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
what impacts is having this is a measure
of

04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces google google tracks
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
all of us i say this all the time it
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't track me because i never put my
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
location on my i never have the location
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
feature of my phone on but it tracks and
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
it categorizes
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
where people are going based on you know
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
the their knowledge of the location of
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
where people wind up so workplaces
 
04:46:39.280 --> 04:46:40.628 align:start position:0%
where people wind up so workplaces
retail

04:46:40.628 --> 04:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
retail
 
04:46:42.550 --> 04:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
recreation this looks at changes in
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:50.310 --> 04:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic and it measures
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces as a percentage of
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
what they were prior to the pandemic so
 
04:46:55.440 --> 04:46:56.628 align:start position:0%
what they were prior to the pandemic so
again

04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
the far left early in the pandemic trips
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
to workplaces were down 50 percent
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
workplaces were closed people were
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
working from home etc we improved we got
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
pretty consistently 20
 
04:47:08.480 --> 04:47:09.350 align:start position:0%
pretty consistently 20
20

04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
below because people were still working
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
from home each big dip there is
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
associated with a holiday so people
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
obviously weren't going to work couple
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
things about this chart that i think are
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
important one new hampshire overall
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
didn't see as big a decline in trips to
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
workplaces as the nation overall
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
the second most important thing
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:47:34.550 --> 04:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
as we get more toward the end here and
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
again the period when the
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
omkron virus was starting to hit
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the distance or the gap between new
 
04:47:43.830 --> 04:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire's trips to workplaces that
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
change in the u.s declines so we were
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
looking more like the u.s
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
and when you get down to the very end
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're basically
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
seeing the same kind of cutbacks and
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces as the u.s the other
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
thing last thing that's really important
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that every
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
holiday is associated with a decline in
 
04:48:06.550 --> 04:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
well if you look at christmas new year
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
holiday of 2021
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
the decline in trips to the workplaces
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
is actually lower
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
than it was
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020. what does that say
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's the impact
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
the mo of the most recent variant of the
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
coronavirus it's having that kind of
 
04:48:27.920 --> 04:48:28.948 align:start position:0%
coronavirus it's having that kind of
impact

04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
again it's temporary
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
and all indications are that it's
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
improving but it is having a significant
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
impact next year
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
again i don't want to belabor the point
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
same this is another private sector
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
metric that i look at it's restaurant
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
reservations seeded restaurant
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
reservations every state company open
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
table takes reservations for a select
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
group of restaurants it compares it to
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:48:53.280 --> 04:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
the same
day

04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and how restaurant reservations
 
04:48:57.600 --> 04:48:58.948 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and how restaurant reservations
compare

04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
compare
 
04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire again
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
looked better and we know this you know
 
04:49:05.670 --> 04:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
this because of what happened with
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals taxes we did pretty well
 
04:49:08.240 --> 04:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals taxes we did pretty well
so

04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
we were
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
in much of the during much of the
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
pandemic pretty close or above
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
significantly above where we were in
 
04:49:16.878 --> 04:49:18.948 align:start position:0%
significantly above where we were in
2019

04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:49:18.958 --> 04:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
2019
again

04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:49:22.470 --> 04:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
until very recently
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
we get down to the time period this is
 
04:49:25.280 --> 04:49:26.310 align:start position:0%
we get down to the time period this is
actually

04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
i think ended that january 8th i think
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
that data ends
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
we see new hampshire reservation
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant reservations actually
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
declined on a percentage basis more than
 
04:49:36.550 --> 04:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
the us
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
again that's the impact so
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a pretty significant
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
negative impact
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of labor labor availability in
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
terms of people's willingness to engage
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
in normal economic activities driving to
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
work going to work because of illness
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
because they're taking care of somebody
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
because their offices
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
are going back to remote work how many
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
a number of individuals who had been
 
04:50:01.760 --> 04:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
a number of individuals who had been
working

04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
from their offices had gone back to work
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
and now are back to working remotely
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot of that
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
but again this is temporary but it gives
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
an idea of how significant the impact
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.270 --> 04:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
starting to run late here this is what's
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
happened to the new hampshire labor
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
force i said we may not get back to
 
04:50:25.120 --> 04:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
force i said we may not get back to
our

04:50:26.550 --> 04:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
level of labor force that we saw
 
04:50:27.920 --> 04:50:29.830 align:start position:0%
level of labor force that we saw
pre-pandemic

04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
some demographic groups have cut back
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
their participation much more than
 
04:50:33.840 --> 04:50:35.430 align:start position:0%
their participation much more than
others

04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
chief among them
 
04:50:37.680 --> 04:50:39.030 align:start position:0%
chief among them
workers

04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
older workers 60 and above
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
why would that be well some is related
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
to health
 
04:50:45.600 --> 04:50:46.788 align:start position:0%
to health
concern

04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
but 60 to 64 is the one that is from my
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
perspective really significant one we've
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
got a lot of individuals in that
 
04:50:56.550 --> 04:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
that age group
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it has they've seen the biggest
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
decline in their labor force petition
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
why would that be well some of it may be
 
04:51:02.480 --> 04:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
why would that be well some of it may be
health

04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
related concerns during the pandemic but
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it is if you think
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
back what's happened to people's
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
retirement savings if they have them and
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do in this state stock
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
market has gone up dramatically housing
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
values have gone up dramatically and a
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
lot people have felt more comfortable
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
with their possibility of stepping out
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the labor force and retiring so we've
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
nationally the percentage of individuals
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for social security who
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
actually filed
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
was much higher last year than it had
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
ever been about two million more people
 
04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
filed for social security last year who
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
were eligible then would be expected
 
04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
if they filed at the same rate that they
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
had in prior years i don't have that
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
data for new hampshire
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's the same
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the other group
 
04:51:59.910 --> 04:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's interesting is younger folks
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that's the real concern the
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
individuals at the upper end some of
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
them will come back in the labor force
 
04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:06.550 align:start position:0%
them will come back in the labor force
perhaps

04:52:06.550 --> 04:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
but we can't expect them to come back
 
04:52:09.520 --> 04:52:10.470 align:start position:0%
but we can't expect them to come back
in

04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
significant numbers or back to the level
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
which is really important because the
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
labor force people have been working
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
longer and we've been counting on that
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're working longer why because we
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
have fewer jobs that require physical
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
strength and ability more of our jobs we
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
do like me sitting at a computer so you
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have to have it it's one thing to
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
be at a computer working when you're 70
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
years old is another thing to try and be
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
on a roof fixing a roof you know so
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
we were counting on that it looks like
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's not going to bounce back the other
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
group is the young younger folks
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
particularly 25 to 29
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
all young folks
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
has have cut back 25 to 29 particularly
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
young males
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
why would that be well
 
04:52:59.190 --> 04:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of those individuals
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
were employed in industries that you
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
know there were layoffs they received
 
04:53:03.920 --> 04:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
know there were layoffs they received
significant

04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
income support
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
we had stimulus payments that
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
added a couple few thousand dollars to
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's account if you're 25 i think
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
back to when i was 25 years old
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
if i was getting that money i would
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
might take an extra few months off um
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
before i have eventually those people
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
will come back they can't remain out of
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
the workforce for 40 years we also had a
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
moratorium and still do on student loans
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
again took some of the pressure off
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
individuals from working so there was
 
04:53:36.628 --> 04:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
more of incentive the other group that i
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to just highlight
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
35 to 39 and that's a little different i
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
said 25 to 29 was young men
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
tend to be a higher percentage of young
 
04:53:45.200 --> 04:53:47.430 align:start position:0%
tend to be a higher percentage of young
men

04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
men
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
35 to 39 tends to be more women and show
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
the next chart here and a lot of that
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
has to do with child care issues
 
04:53:56.480 --> 04:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
has to do with child care issues
um

04:53:57.430 --> 04:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know this is a chart that just shows
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
what's happened to the child care
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
industry and just a segment of the child
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
care industry because a lot of child
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
care is
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
family businesses that don't
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily have employees formal
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
employees so this just looks at the
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
segment of the
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
industry that has
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees that reports to our
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment into our employment
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance fund you see the
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
number it's really took a toll the
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic has really taken a toll hard to
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
get workers
 
04:54:27.670 --> 04:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's created significant problems for
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
women again 35 to 39 is uh and even into
 
04:54:35.670 --> 04:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
the later 20s are most likely to be
 
04:54:38.230 --> 04:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
the parents of children's ages six and
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
under which have the most dramatic child
 
04:54:42.390 --> 04:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
care needs
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
so until and this is a vexing problem so
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
until that gets solved we're going to
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
struggle i think uh with
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
getting that segment of the workforce
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
back excellent
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
applying the same level of labor force
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
participation each of these demographic
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
groups that was present in 2019 again
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic to the current
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
number of individuals
 
04:55:12.150 --> 04:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
in those demographic groups in new
 
04:55:12.160 --> 04:55:13.110 align:start position:0%
in those demographic groups in new
hampshire

04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is how many more or fewer people we
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
would have in the labor force in each of
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
these demographic groups
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
so all told we'd have about 22 000 more
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
people in the labor force if we had 2019
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the key to our recovery is really
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
getting those individuals back into the
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
labor force
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
i did want to i do want to finish up
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
with a couple of the last two with some
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
positive notes i mentioned the in
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
migration the net in migration this is
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
just the chart goes back to 2001 i could
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
go back to the 80s where you'd see
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
regular 15 to 20 000 net
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
in migration we saw a period of time
 
04:55:56.958 --> 04:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
in migration we saw a period of time
where

04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
you as policy makers and everybody in
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
the state was very concerned that we
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
were losing more people than we were
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
gaining and there were some real reasons
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
for that the
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
great recession
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of individuals that typically
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
moved into the state tended to be
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
families two-way journey married couple
 
04:56:13.200 --> 04:56:14.230 align:start position:0%
families two-way journey married couple
families

04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
college educated
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
they were moving here they probably
 
04:56:19.030 --> 04:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
owned a house somewhere else ages 30 to
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
44 they probably owned a house it would
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
have been difficult for them to sell a
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
lot of people underwater would want to
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
buy that was also difficult during that
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
time so we saw some net outfitters it
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
picked up again
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know as the economy got back to full
 
04:56:33.040 --> 04:56:34.628 align:start position:0%
you know as the economy got back to full
employment

04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
as housing market sees
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
but the most recent and this is 2020 but
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's really 2020 to july of 2021. i had
 
04:56:46.708 --> 04:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
forecast a little over 6 000 individuals
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
on net would move in that is a pretty
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
significant increase from the prior
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
years and it turns out census bureau
 
04:56:56.708 --> 04:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
reports that we actually added 13 500.
 
04:56:56.718 --> 04:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
reports that we actually added 13 500.
why

04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
there was a definite
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
desire for less density
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
as the pandemic hit we saw big
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
exodus from cities and metropolitan
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
areas boston metro area
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
hartford new york city
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a real
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
magnet for that was a real magnet for
 
04:57:17.590 --> 04:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
that and i track
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
views of homes for sale
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was two to three times the
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
national average maine as well this is
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
the chart that shows how we
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
compare to other states it's
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
that number of individuals on net who
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
moved into the state compared to moved
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
out as a percentage of our 2020
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
employment so
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
all of northern new england benefited
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
from that desire for less density and
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to remote work remotely so
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to get a real
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
good demographic benefit from this
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
because i think even if it's not as
 
04:57:52.638 --> 04:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
because i think even if it's not as
strong

04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
strong
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
it will still play out
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward as remote work
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities increase
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
the key question is we're going to get a
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
great we're going to get great
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
demographic benefits
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
key question is
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
can we keep this rolling and can we keep
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
it rolling
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a lot of places
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
for people
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
to live
 
04:58:16.868 --> 04:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
who want to move here we're seeing that
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with that in spades right now
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
we have constraints on housing there's
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
not we know that vacancy rates rental
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates are at historic lows
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot being built that's
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a real constraint i think we
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
have a great opportunity to address our
 
04:58:32.000 --> 04:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
have a great opportunity to address our
demographics

04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
by this movement into the state which is
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
how we traditionally have dealt with it
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to increase our birth
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
rates that's not going to happen
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i think we've got to get um and solve
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
some of these housing issues in order
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
for us to to see the real benefits last
 
04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:49.590 align:start position:0%
for us to to see the real benefits last
slide

04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
this is my forecast of job growth um 3.8
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
i think will wind up eventually in when
 
04:58:58.628 --> 04:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
all is said and done
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
or very close to it i think we're at
 
04:59:03.990 --> 04:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
about right now 3.4
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
given what bls thinks and i believe is
 
04:59:08.788 --> 04:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
an underestimate 2022 will be a little
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
bit slower by 2023 we'll start really
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
running into even more severe labor
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
constraints but overall that is in that
 
04:59:19.350 --> 04:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
implies that we'll get back to our full
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
our pre-planademic levels of employment
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
by the end of this year and it will take
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
about another year before we get back to
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
our pre-pandemic trend growth that we
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
would have expected had the pandemic not
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
occurred and with that i will stop and
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:35.830 --> 04:59:35.840 align:start position:0%

04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
my online messages keep telling me that
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
biden's going to take away my ira we're
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to have an economy collapse in
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
2023 or 2024 the new people that are
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
forecasting are all rosy
 
05:00:09.840 --> 05:00:10.868 align:start position:0%
forecasting are all rosy
uh

05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to believe
 
05:00:12.798 --> 05:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to believe
what

05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
you probably have more figures than he
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
does but
 
05:00:16.878 --> 05:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
does but
yeah

05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:00:17.680 --> 05:00:23.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
well

05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:00:26.470 --> 05:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
where that information came from uh look
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
the you know the economy right now is in
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
much better shape than i think is
 
05:00:32.550 --> 05:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
commonly recognized
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
we know that the labor market is strong
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
we know that we just saw a gdp growth
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
that was um you know
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
for the quarter over almost seven
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
percent for the year was 5.7 percent a
 
05:00:45.430 --> 05:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
little bit less i think at this time
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
last year i was saying i thought it
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
would be close to seven percent but we
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
had two variants of of the coronavirus
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
that took a lot off um
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know and we do have some real
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
challenges um but i think the majority
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
of economic forecasters believe that
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
overall the economy's in
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
in good shape people household incomes
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
are strong income growth has been good
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
the big issues that we face
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
are on the supply side and they're on
 
05:01:14.470 --> 05:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
the supply side again largely because of
 
05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
a pandemic they have
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
really disrupted the supply chains
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
both in the us but particularly in asia
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
and and southeast asia where we rely on
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of products
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
until those things
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
get resolved we're going to be
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
constrained on on supply demand is there
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
people have money they want to spend and
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
when they want to spend and supply
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep up what happens
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
prices go up
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
so that's a real danger my original
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
forecast i had thought energy prices
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
will come down this first half of this
 
05:01:49.360 --> 05:01:50.948 align:start position:0%
will come down this first half of this
year

05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
that isn't looking as as likely there's
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
some world events that are causing some
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
problems there and i thought the second
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
half of the year we would see supply
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
chain issues start to get resolved in
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
combination that would result in prices
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
being significantly look
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
30 percent of the rise in prices over
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
the last year is related to automobiles
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
to automobiles the cost of automobiles
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
used car prices wholesale prices are up
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
56 percent over the year
 
05:02:22.400 --> 05:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
56 percent over the year
so

05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
that won't last
 
05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues are taking longer
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
than i had anticipated but
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know those are very different
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
problems they're problems that we can
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
see the end of the end of a pandemic end
 
05:02:34.798 --> 05:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
see the end of the end of a pandemic end
of

05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues so i don't see a
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
cataclysmic or apocalyptic kind of
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
economic outlook
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay way over
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
there hello thank you thanks for the
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
great presentation i have some labor
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
force participation questions for you
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
lots of my constituent business owners
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
are always wondering where the people
 
05:02:56.160 --> 05:02:56.948 align:start position:0%
are always wondering where the people
went

05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
went
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and particularly the numbers on the 25
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
to 29 year olds the 4606 that left the
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
workforce where you said mostly were men
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
do you know what
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
industries they left from do you have
 
05:03:11.350 --> 05:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
information on that oh yeah
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
we do to a degree yes
 
05:03:16.550 --> 05:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
and again individuals
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
age group tend to dominate in a few
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
industries they tend to you know it's a
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people early in their careers
 
05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
they tend to work
 
05:03:30.390 --> 05:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm this is such a a gross
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
generalization but more
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
young people work in hospitality
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
in retail in recreation industries so
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
those industries have been especially
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
hard hit by people leaving those
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
workforces hospitality industry in
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
particular you know if you look at the
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
the and health care is another one
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
though health care health care is a
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
little different health care
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
certain occupations in health care not
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
physicians not actual providers but
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
support occupations tend to have a
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
younger demographic they also tend to
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
have a female demographic 80 percent of
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
people who work in health care are
 
05:04:04.560 --> 05:04:06.150 align:start position:0%
people who work in health care are
female

05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
female
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
so the younger demographic is a lot is
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
more represented in the industries that
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
have been hardest or originally were
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
hardest hit retail hospitality
 
05:04:17.120 --> 05:04:18.788 align:start position:0%
hardest hit retail hospitality
recreation

05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
they were laid off they received
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
significant income support
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
the jobs didn't look all that attractive
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
and again without
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
many of them without family
 
05:04:30.160 --> 05:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
many of them without family
responsibilities

05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
student loans may be
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know as they have been delayed or a
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
moratorium on repayments made it a
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for people to step
 
05:04:39.040 --> 05:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for people to step
back

05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
step out but i didn't show you is a
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
trend of that and what you see is
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
we are off the trough we're off the
 
05:04:46.958 --> 05:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
we are off the trough we're off the
bottom

05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
we saw the worst of the of the
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
lack of participation earlier in the
 
05:04:53.760 --> 05:04:54.628 align:start position:0%
lack of participation earlier in the
year

05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
and it has been inching up if i showed
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
you that same
 
05:05:01.590 --> 05:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
chart a month or two months ago you
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
would have seen not 4 700 you would have
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
seen like 5300
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
individuals not in the labor force so it
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
is getting better and it will get better
 
05:05:12.550 --> 05:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.320 --> 05:05:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
saying

05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:05:17.360 --> 05:05:18.788 align:start position:0%
saying
hey

05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
hey
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
your presentations
 
05:05:20.958 --> 05:05:21.910 align:start position:0%
your presentations
excellent

05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.000 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
you
