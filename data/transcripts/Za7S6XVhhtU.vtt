00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 194 an act
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
relative to interference with child
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
custody the intent of House Bill 194 is
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
to amend New Hampshire RSA 633 colon 4
 
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the current statute which
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
already recognizes the withholding minor
 
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
children under age 18 from a parent
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
guardian or other person having lawful
 
00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities as described
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
461a is either a class me felony If the
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
child is removed from the state or MISD
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
demean a crime from within the
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
state unfortunately current law
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement often incorrectly tells
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
tells an aggrieved par parent that it's
 
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
a civil matter for the family courts to
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicate and they should file for
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
Relief through the family court it's not
 
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 align:start position:0%
unusual for a hearing to request a
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing request to take six to eight
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
weeks amending our current law with
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 194 will strengthen the law
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
by emphasizing penalties for the first
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
and second offense making both first and
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
second offense of misdemeanor and a
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
class B felony penalties for third and
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses by specifying
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
specifying these penalties House Bill
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
194 will Al also hopefully ensure that
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Court's order is enforced by any no
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
agency we all know that any law without
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
penalties is a worthless piece of paper
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's imperative to recognize the
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of parents in raising
 
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
and having access to their children
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
parental rights not just legal
 
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
formalities they're an essential an
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
essential and emotional and
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
psychological well-being of both the
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
child and parent every parent has the
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
right to be involved in their child's
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
life to nurture them guide them and
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
provide them with the stability and love
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
they need to thrive unfortun
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many divorcing couples are
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
so enraged that they can't see the
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
emotional damage they're inflicting on
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
their beloved children much less
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
understand the long-term damage that
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
often caused by their own selfish
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
behavior a broken home is devastating
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
for children children and being forcibly
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
kept from either loving parent is
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
something we have a chance to prevent
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
kids need both parents this fundamental
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
right ensures that children receive
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
balanced upbringing emotional support
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the diverse perspectives that only
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
both parents can
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
provide I urge you my colleagues to
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
support HBO 194 and join me in taking a
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
stand against C custody interference by
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
doing so we're not only upholding the
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
law but also protecting the sacred bond
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
between parents and their children
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
together we can make a difference in the
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
lives of countless families and children
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
who deserve to live a safe and in a St
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
safe and stable
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
environment thank you for your attention
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
I hopefully for your commitment to this
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
important issue and I ask you to vote
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
out to pass on House Bill
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
share uh my concern uh with this is is
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
um uh paragraph the new paragraph five
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
making it a a a felony to knowingly or
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
purposely interfere with a lawful court
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
order um it's already uh uh if you f
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
fair to say that it's it's a misdemeanor
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
to uh violate a court order it's
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
contempt of court you agree with
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that to violate a a court order should
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
be contempt of court really it is
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
contempt of court so my question is
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
why why why do we why does why do you
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
and the co Prime sponsor want
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
to enter a felony into the mix of the
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
difficult process of people divorcing
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
and and dealing with child custody why a
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
felony rather than a misdemeanor I
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
felony excuse you're correct it's a
 
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
felony if you take it out take the child
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
out of the state why do we want that um
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
well if you don't be if you don't want
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
to be arrested for selling drugs don't
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
sell drugs if you don't want to be
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
arrested for
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
for child um you know keeping children
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
away from a parent that has legal right
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
to them don't do it don't do it a third
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
time all right I don't have anything
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
forther any further questions seeing
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
Albert good morning Mr chair and members
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Dana alre
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
nashille New Hampshire uh father of four
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
children and I have certainly been a
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
victim of this sort of thing while my
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
oldest child lives with me and the
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
younger three have since aged out uh my
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
family uh situation involved a
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
seven-year Odyssey of the younger three
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
kids being taken through multiple
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
States uh California Michigan
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts kind of all One Step of
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of the courts and nobody knew
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
where they
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
were so interference with custody is
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem and I am 100% on
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
board and
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
cheering uh sort of the speech I just
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
heard on what we're trying to accomplish
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
with this I think that's laudable and I
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
think we need to do something because we
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
have a statute that's not being enforced
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
that being said there's some language in
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is written that I find
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
extremely problematic and I think the
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill as written would actually weaken
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
the statute so it's my hope we can kind
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
of just tease that all apart and pass
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
something to strengthen this that's a
 
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.910 align:start position:0%
something to strengthen this that's a
good

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.230 align:start position:0%
good

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
24 uh where it discusses fleeing the
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
commission of attempted Commission of
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
domestic or violence as those terms are
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
used in RSA
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
173b uh I think that's extremely
 
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
173b uh I think that's extremely
problematic

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
because uh RSA 173b is a civil
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
statute uh it's
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
being uh used to weaponize the family
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
courts uh if you are now inserting that
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
as affirmative defense all any
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous person needs to do is uh
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
run down and get an automatic civil
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
order and now they've got a an out to go
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
commit a serious
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
crime uh so you know as a matter of
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
first principles I think anytime you put
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal law together and try
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
and mix them up and it's unclear which
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
is which you need to be really careful
 
00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
about what you're doing and unintended
 
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
about what you're doing and unintended
consequences

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
there uh I do have a handout here I
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
apologize there's only a couple copies
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh printer Jam this morning uh that
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
describes the systematic abuse of uh
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
civil demestic statutes under
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
173b so uh and how that's actually a
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
serious problem in New Hampshire right
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
now where you have criminals who go get
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
an order against their
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
victims and now you've got the the
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
criminals gold and he get he or she gets
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
out of everything and that's just not
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay um that being said again forgive me
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
there's only a couple copies of this
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
then I'll take questions if you just
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
give them to the representative on the
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
end we'll have our committee assistant
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
you with that being
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
said with regard to the rest of the bill
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
did you say that you were in favor of it
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
section so uh specifically not because
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
of this one section but let me add to
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
accomplish what I think the sponsors
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish I would just add something
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
very simple to the statute along the
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
lines that if a peace officer has
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that someone
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
has violated the statute the peace offic
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
or shall keyword being shall investigate
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
write a report something to that effect
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
because the real problem right now is we
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
have a statute that's good enough it's
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
not perfect but it's good enough and
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's just simply going completely
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
unforced and you know as representative
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
of Love said uh when people call the
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
cops they're incorrectly told it's a
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
civil matter that's the problem right
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
there just kind of if it were me kind of
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
scrap all of this in in terms of
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
language and just put in something
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
simple that if people call the cops and
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
the cops are probable cause they shall
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
investigate thank you any questions for
 
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.150 align:start position:0%
investigate thank you any questions for
the

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
m i noticed that the bill uh doesn't
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually change the first four parts of
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
the current statute the bill is actually
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
an addition to to the current statute
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm curious about is what the
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
problem is that you're really trying to
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
solve with the bill um
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
so I I don't believe he testified he was
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill so I'm sorry I I
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
don't believe he testified he was in
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
favor of this
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill I think the problems have been
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated by rep love and I
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
think just tacking this language onto
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't solve those problems but I
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
think we really need to solve those
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
problems and he articulated those
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
problems that we really need to solve
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
extremely well thank you any further
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
Dart I apologize if I didn't get the
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%

um as our elected policymakers you have
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the greatest stability reform outdated
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
laws to better protect Children and

Families interference with custody has
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
been a crime in all 50
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
states in 1983 New Hampshire enacted
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
this law recognizing when a child is

statement it is contrary to the crime of

interference with custody and fails to
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
equally protect the child and both

they are withholding the minor child
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
never reporting the child abuse and
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
never filing with the

court this causes harm to children
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
creating attachment bonds with the minor
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
child and one parent when this happens
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
the agreed parent targeted parent has to
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
petition the court pay an additional fee
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
to reopen a case that has been
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicated the parent has been deemed
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
fit and has lawful parental rights and
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities under 461 as outlined
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
in current
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
law it could be several months before
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
the aggrieved parent can get a hearing
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court and rarely does the
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
judge hold the obstructing parent in
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
contempt of the already adjudicated
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
court order there is no relief for the
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
innocent parent or more importantly the
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
innocent children when law enforcement
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
refuses to enforce the law this
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to current law is not intended
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
to have parents arrested that should be
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
a last resort the intent of this
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
legislation is to ensure the god-given
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
rights of children and their fundamental
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
right to maintain a loving meaningful
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
relationship with both parents after
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
separation or divorce is upheld this can
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
only happen when law enforcement informs
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
the instructing obstructing parent of
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
the consequences for interfering with
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
custody or enforce the law of
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
interference with custody when New
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement and the courts
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
fail to enforce the laws they have been
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
leg that you have legislated they are

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask each of you to support
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
the passage of this
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any questions for the
 
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any questions for the
witness

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for for being here the
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said that he thinks the
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
current law would be helped
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
if we just had language that said that
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
peace officers need to understand it's
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
not a civil matter it's a criminal
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
matter would you agree with that I 100%
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
and you could forgo this whole bill and
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
simply add a line in there that they
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
need to enforce court orders that have
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated the parent has been
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
deemed fit and in current law if you
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
look I think I added that to my
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
testimony up there they have 72 hours to
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
file a report if there is legitimate and
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's not happening they're withholding
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
the child and these children are not
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
seeing their other parents for months
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
months years and you'll hear testimony
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that today so it needs to be enforced
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
they have a draw law enforcement I
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
mean thank you our justice system is
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
failing epically and I don't know where
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
we lost that um we need to get it
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
back thank you you're welcome any
 
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
back thank you you're welcome any
further

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
and Mr
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
chairman honorable well repr
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'm happy to be here um
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
as you know as you may know I've been
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
trying for several years to chip away at
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
injustices that are going on in Family
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
Court not because somebody wants them to
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
be unfair it's just the laws haven't
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
been written
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
adequately so this is to correct a real
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
serious issue that probably stems back
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
from the historic attitude of law
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement to domes stics do you
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
remember years ago they would say it's
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
domestic that finally ended in
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
Connecticut about 40 years ago when a
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
woman knew that her estranged husband
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
who had a court order a restraining
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
order was coming to her house so she
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
called the police and said the guy's
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
coming to the house they said it's just
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
a domestic we'll show up later well by
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
the time they got back she was in
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
terrible shape he had he had assaulted
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
her so badly she spent time in the
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
hospital then she sued them in those
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
days a million dollars was a lot of
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
money the town had to pay and everybody
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
said oh it's a demestic I guess we have
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
to show up so I think it's historic that
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's attitude is that uh any kind of
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
domestic dispute is civil not criminal
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
but this law has been on the book
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
now the one I gave a packet that has
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
colored paper so this colored paper this
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
color is the original law that this uh
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment will just add to it doesn't
 
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.190 align:start position:0%
Amendment will just add to it doesn't
change

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
anything um on N Roman numeral two a
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
person's guilty of a misdemeanor if such
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
person knowingly takes entices detains
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
conceals a child under the age of 18 or
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
CA causes any such child to be taken
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
enticed detained or concealed with
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
intent to detain or conceal such child
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
from either a person or an agency that
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
has the right to guard that child so
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
this is not a New Concept the trouble is
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's new to our police force and when I
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
asked I called the AG's office first to
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
find out who does have authority this is
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
really either a misdemeanor
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
felony that's not civil and I even had
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
that discussion with I have in my town
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
we have very respectable people I trust
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
as Chief and a deputy chief and they
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
still think this is civil so we need the
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
top law enforcement of the state to
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
confirm that it is their responsibility
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the qu to enforce it and one
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the questions was well have do they
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
know what to enforce well after spending
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
thousands to go to court and get your
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
court order you've got something in
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
writing with a date on it that says what
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to so you could show
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
that to whatever police our uh law
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer comes to the
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
house um and it's got a date because the
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
two parents you know here's one parent
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
coming to pick the child up the other
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
parent has a child so they should both
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
be there um so you do have some written
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
proof right there what I was told by the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
AG's office is we don't do that the
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
sheriff does that well I don't know
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
about most of you but I can't just pick
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
up the phone and call the sheriff I
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
really think this ought to be just a
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
simple matter I don't think it'll take
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
too many uh charges of
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and it is a misdemeanor not
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
a felony for the first two times I think
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
after twice you should get the message
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
um because we've had people sitting at
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
these tables just last year two women
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
from conquer both of them have the
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
documents from the court giving them
 
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.990 align:start position:0%
documents from the court giving them
50%

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
50%
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
custody they haven't seen their children
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
in over a year because the police won't
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
do it and School departments are really
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
scared to do anything that's the least
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
bit questionable that's my personal
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
experience I can't show you that in
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
engraved in Granite anywhere but this is
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
a serious problem and it to me is just
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
ludicrous to be told well that's a civil
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
matter so go back to court okay if I'm
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
holding a court order what good is it to
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to go get another
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
one so this simply says that this I
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
thought it was pretty neat that the
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
wording changed now this you all do you
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
version they did go print them but the
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
first the first things they printed were
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the original without the corrections the
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
only difference between the original um
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
194 and this amended version is uh under
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
line five underline line five now has
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
now includes one
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
two b and a b and c and before that was
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
broken into two different paragraphs
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
instead of one that's the only change
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
there and then the real important change
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
was to say what the penal the penalty is
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
because the first version actually had
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
fines well money changes every year
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
value of it that's silly to tie to a a
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
fine so this one simply
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
says with real
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
teeth you're guilty of a misdemeanor the
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
first or second event so you get a if
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
you slip up once and find out you were
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
wrong you do have a chance to set that
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
right but according to uh some parents
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
who refuse to part with a child and I'm
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
sure it's because they think nothing's
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to happen to them now they're
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
guilty of a clasby felony that's really
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
serious ious I think that is a
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
deterrent and I just hope that we can
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
get law
 
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.350 align:start position:0%
get law
enforcement

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
aware and accepting of a sticky
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
situation it's not fun to go to a house
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
and tell a parent you have to give your
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
child up to this other
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
parent um I realize I
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
realize that anybody who's I I let's put
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
it like this I have no attorneys who
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be caught dead doing family law
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
there's just so much emotional baggage
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
and risk that it's not a fun situation
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I understand why police would be just
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
really happy if we keep this civil so
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have to but parents who've
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
gone through hell sometimes to get the
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
right to see their
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
children my husband being one out of
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
state um they need they they deserve to
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you representative could
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
you tell
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
me how the changes that are being
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
proposed will make it any more likely
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the police will enforce the law
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
stands well we're just hoping that
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
bringing the subject up and making it
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
heard publicly that this is a crime to
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
withhold um
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah the more people who are aware
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
of this I think we have a better chance
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
of reaching the top LW enforcement in
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state I'd certainly be happy to go
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
knock on his door again I was well
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
received for another subject
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
before it would would it not be possible
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
for us to Simply write a bill that says
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
the attorney General will um put out uh
 
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.549 align:start position:0%
the attorney General will um put out uh
an

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
opinion letting the police departments
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
know that this is indeed a criminal
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
statute and they should be enforcing it
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would love that amend away
 
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:50.509 align:start position:0%
I would love that amend away
representative

00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you for your
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony uh following up on on the
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
chair's question um
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
my experience is uh on a daily
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
basis uh the
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
people the law enforcement entities who
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
need to know that uh these are crimes
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
and not civil matters are the city or
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal prosecutors or the county
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices uh I would you know
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
in in line with what the chair was
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting I would suggest reaching out
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
to the uh County attorneys Association
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and I can after this is over tell
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
you who to talk to and and and they need
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
to educate police departments they're
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
the ones in the first instance who are
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
educating police departments and and
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
that might accomplish what uh What uh I
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
think is a laudable goal to get get the
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
statute even as it exists now uh
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
enforced any further
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you much every idea you have is
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:32.519 align:start position:0%
Representatives not really sure if I'm
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
for this bill or against this bill I'm
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
not really sure if I'm confused or all
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
of you are
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
confused um 1911 the 61st Congress
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
abolished all circuit courts we were in
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
this building last year and testified
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
that rep Smith asked uh cab that if
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court was a leg a constitutional
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
court and she said
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
no there's one problem you guys need to
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
investigate number two a duty to give
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
decision which are advisory only and so
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
without Force as judicial judgments may
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
be laid upon the legislative court but
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
not a constitutional court on
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
established under article 3 Williams
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
1933 um probable CS can't come from
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
civil court uh that's part of the
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution that's what it
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
says um I've gotten 6 hours and 12 years
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
with my son in New Hampshire family
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
court because 16 Jud judges got
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
immunity when I have five pages of case
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
law from the Supreme Court that says
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
Bond the United States people are
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
sovereign and not the state of the
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
government so why are these judges
 
00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:40.070 align:start position:0%
government so why are these judges
giving

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
immunity the
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
negligence from Family
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
Court sorry hold on give me one second
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
it so getting back to the
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
173b uh obviously if it's a statute it
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
has to match the Constitution if it's
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
not it's unconstitutional and the only
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
way to be charged with a statute is if
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
you give consent it's also in the
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the negligence from
 
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:19.470 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the negligence from
Family

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
Court by using criminal statutes such as
 
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:24.669 align:start position:0%
Court by using criminal statutes such as
644

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
644
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
633 uh against litigant and civil court
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
without evidence because Rules of
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply if there was
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
actually probable evidence of an actual
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
crime the family courts are liable for
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
not reporting to an actual Criminal
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
Court only criminal courts are supposed
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
to be Pro Prosecuting criminal codes not
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
these family
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
courts uh Family Court likes to say that
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
they give civil sanctions but it's
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
actually the criminal code so why is
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
Family Court offering criminal code in
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
Family Court without evidence title 62
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
section 625 through6 651 only and not
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
173 and in US code's only Title
 
00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.669 align:start position:0%
173 and in US code's only Title
18

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
so these Family Court judges for 12
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
years have been fighting to see my
 
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.830 align:start position:0%
years have been fighting to see my
son

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
son
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
um and obviously they don't care about
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
evidence so judge Gardner which I guess
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
recently retired he wrote in an order on
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
4324 that it's the preponderance of the
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
evidence and Rules of Evidence don't
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
apply so obviously he intentionally
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
misled every
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
here or some of you that was here and
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
other people that were not um so
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence is greater
 
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
than 50% true but if Rules of Evidence
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
don't apply that means the evidence is
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
inadmissible it's unreliable it's
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
incomplete and it's not it's not
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
believable so you guys have a lot of
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
work to do because you can't have propon
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the evidence and you can't have Rules
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
of Evidence don't apply that's what
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
judge Gardner wrote and then he said
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence don't apply to the mo
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the motion that I seek to
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
vacate so why would a family court
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
judge deny the motion to vacate a
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
protective order a criminal protective
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
order in Family Court when evidence
 
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.909 align:start position:0%
order in Family Court when evidence
didn't

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
apply he wrote it I have
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
it um New Hampshire Supreme Court denied
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
a rident Tory two district courts denied
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
my case US court of appeals denied my
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
case um and they all cited Rooker Felman
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
which is weird because the bear case
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
um you guys have a lot of work to do
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
should probably read the Constitution
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
before you start drafting these bills so
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
you you stay in line with the
 
00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:41.829 align:start position:0%
you you stay in line with the
law

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I'd love to take questions I have a
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the state cab was in
 
00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.790 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the state cab was in
here

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
before and she's like well you know the
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
people go to the judicial conduct
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
committee because that's the committee
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
that people are that for law
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
complaints well that's weird cuz I have
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
a letter from the judicial conduct
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee that says they can't hear
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
administrative law complaints so again
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
rep cutab was in here misleading
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
everybody intentionally because I have
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
the letters to prove
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
it so if you really want to stop this
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
child abuse and neglect and Mis prison
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
and page and slavery and kidnapping
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
against our
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
kids let's get back to the Constitution
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
I don't understand 12 years protective
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
order no evidence evidence didn't
 
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.069 align:start position:0%
order no evidence evidence didn't
apply

00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I have all the paperwork I just filed
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
a motion for habius Corpus on Friday in
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
District Court for the Attorney General
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
to actually answer a question under oath
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
because he's he's failed four years in a
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
row um I wonder why they get immunity
 
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
row um I wonder why they get immunity
for

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
that I'll take any questions but I'm not
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
how do criminal statutes in Family Court
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
without evidence anybody have a question
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
anybody have an answer to that I would
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%

favor of hb27 FN establishing the crime

of criminal neglect of a child also
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
known as Charlotte's law I have been a
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutor for almost 10 years
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
and have been involved in hundreds of
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations pertaining to
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
child abuse I am also a member of the

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's task force on
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
child abuse neglect I believe it is time
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire join the majority of
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
other states in criminalized child
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
neglect presently law enforcement is
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
limited with the charges it can bring
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
against those who injure children
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
through neglect while we are sometimes
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to bring assault charges jurors
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
have difficulty labeling injuries caused
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
by neglect as assault the endangering
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
the welfare of a child statute is very
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
specific and only encompasses a very n
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
narrow set of circumstances additionally
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
there is no statute which addresses
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
instances where caregivers fail to
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
protect a child from sexual
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
assault I prosecuted a 16-year-old
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
juvenile a couple years back who was
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulting his younger brother
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
when that victim came forward at age 11
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
he disclosed not only the sexual abuse
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
at the hands of his brother but also
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
that he had told their father about the
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and that their father did
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to address or prevent it his
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
father's inaction caused him to continue
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
to be sexually abused and he until he
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
disclosed to a third party this inaction
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
also delayed his abuser's ability to get
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
the help that he needed to address his
 
01:05:10.279 --> 01:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
the help that he needed to address his
sexualized

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
sexualized
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
behaviors while the juvenile was
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
adjudicated through the juvenile system
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
no charges could be brought against the
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
father I believe this statute will be a
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
valuable tool and more importantly a
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
meaningful deterrent to child neglect in
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
cases of dcyf involvement it can
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
motivate a caregiver to comply with a
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
safety plan I believe this bill is
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
necessary to address the gaps in how New
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prevents and addresses child
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and I ask that you
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
find hb27 FN ought to pass happy to take
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
has um did you plan on testifying
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
councelor too so I would Echo attorney
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
garage statement and I'd also say I
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
think this bill fills a hole that exists
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
in our current stat ratory
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
scheme another example of conduct that
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
sort of gets put into another place but
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
should be really child neglect is
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's often instances where a child
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
gets into some sort of controlled
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
substance and does not die uh there is
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes serious harm but since there
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
is no death it does not fit into the
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide statute this would
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
allow us to prosecute that currently
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
other counties are putting that into a
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
statute called Reckless conduct with a
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon I think this much better
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
fits what is happening there uh so I do
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
think that this addresses a hole in our
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes I do think that the
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill put forth is narrowly tailored uh I
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
have spoken with representative Sher to
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
address a language comment uh so we're
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
happy to include changing the language
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
of who is responsible for the child
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
neglect uh to sort of mirror what's
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
already done and the endangering the
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
welfare of child or incompetent in 639
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
colon 3 but I do think this fills a gap
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to take any questions I
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
have a a quick question I notice you
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
have um necessary Medical Care um does
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
this bill leave any type of exemption
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
for um some people for religious reasons
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
who decide that they don't want to do
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
certain things what what's the
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
definition of necessary medical care so
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
I do think when looking at necessary
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
medical care I think we're looking at
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
truly necessary medical care I think
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
what was going to happen in in
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
situations like that is the state's
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to procure an expert to
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
say that this is necessary medical care
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about some topics
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
where there are disagreements for
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
example vaccines uh you're going to be
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
in a situation where there's going to be
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
a medical professional who is going to
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
be able to take the stand and say for
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
the defense Council that this is not
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
medically necessary and so as a
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutor it is our duty to make sure
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
that we bring a charge that we have a
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
good faith basis to believe we can prove
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
Beyond a reasonable doubt if there's not
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
then we won't be able to bring that
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
charge so I do think that a lot of that
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
is sort of subsumed by that exception
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
just as a prosecutor we have to believe
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
we can bring it and actually prove it
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt and on
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
something like vaccines where there are
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
medical experts who will testify both
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
ways I don't think we could ask a jury
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
to find Beyond a reasonable doubt that a
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine was medically
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessary no I'm assuming perhaps
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
something that is obviously medically
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
necessary but for some people um I
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
understand there are certain religions
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
where they say you know we're just going
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
to leave it up to God and not I think
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think um which one it is
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
but I I remember a case in Pennsylvania
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
I think um where parents um weren't
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
treating a bacterial infection or
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
something like that and the child was
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
getting sicker and it ended up in do we
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
have any type of a um in this law is it
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
compliment contemplate it or have you
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
thought about a defense where someone
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
could say it's our religious right not
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
to treat this but I'm trying to do is
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't go down
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere where we end up wrecking that
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
something that's really good in this law
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that is not contemplated in the
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
statute as it currently is that's
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly something that that could be
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in an addition um I don't know
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
if attorney Gro has any further comments
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
on that so in the statute that I re
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
statutes that I researched across the
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
country there were some that included a
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
provision uh for those who for religious
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
reasons didn't seek their child to have
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
medical care however if you got into a
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
situation where a child was um dying or
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
passed away because their parents had a
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
religious belief that they shouldn't be
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
obtaining medical care that person would
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
still have been found um neglectful um
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
through the division of child of
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
children youth and families um whether
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
or not that we want to prosecute that
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
person I think
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that we would and I think
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that would fit under a negligent
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
homicide statute for instance and
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's no religious exemption for that
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
um the reason we sought to include this
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
law is because we find ourselves
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
twisting to fit certain circumstances in
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
the assault Statute in the ENT homicide
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
statute and his County attorney um
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
hilard said um in unless a child dies
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's really no remedy for it so I
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
would uh urge the committee um to pass
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill because I do believe that um
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
that it is worth Prosecuting those cases
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
even where there might be a religious
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
belief um if there if there happens to
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
be serious bodily injury but again it's
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
something that could be done with an
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
amendment if you found that religious um
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
for religious reasons somebody wasn't
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining medical Medical Care
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
and if that instance didn't result in
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury or death maybe
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's where you make the amendment but
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
I do think that children are who are um
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
have injuries that are resulting in
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury or death uh that
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
covering basically I just I think that
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
this has probably been already um um
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
litigated somewhere um perhaps even up
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court so I what I'd like
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
to do is be sure that there's not
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
already some case law out there that we
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
could tailor this language to that so if
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
you could maybe take a look and see you
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
said you'd found some cases I I I was
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
looking at uh statutes that other states
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
have passed for child neglect or their
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
versions of endangering the welfare of a
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay of a child
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
um I have not done outside Research into
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
whether those statutes were upheld by
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
their Supreme Courts but I would assume
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
that if they have that provision in
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
there they're still on the books they
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
probably are good all right thank you
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative m
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
um along the lines of what uh
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative Roy was asking I noticed
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
that um in the definitions we have a
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
definition for necessary care but we
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
don't have definitions for necessary
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
food necessary clothing necessary
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
medical care or necessary shelter do you
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
feel um that without definitions those
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
that language is
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguous I do not I think that would
 
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately come down to the question of
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
the decider of fact and in the criminal
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
world that is the jury so I think the
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
jury would be left to determine was that
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
necessary food was that necessary
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
clothing or was that necessary shelter
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the appropriate
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
instance any further questions
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
Ro thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I would just like
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
to to clarify so I know there's times
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
when a school district would call say
 
01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
when a school district would call say
DCF

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
and many many examples I'm sure that
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
that you can think of quickly as well
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and the response that is often told
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
is they're doing the best they can right
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
and when a reasonable person will look
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
at it and say that it it is clearly
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
neglect I mean it's you know continuous
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
and continuous and continuous so I'm
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the examples that you that
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
are here like under one and then it says
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know a through F would that be
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
basically that exception as well they're
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can would that
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
fall under
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
these are are you talking about I'm
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think I understand yeah so
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
so there's been examples where the
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
school will call DCF right and the and
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
and the complaint might be um the person
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
where it's it's it's
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
physically obvious that there is neglect
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
happening whether it be they're not
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
eating at home or the child is telling
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
us that right and again these are
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes their worst case scenarios but
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
they do exist
 
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.070 align:start position:0%
they do exist
or

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
unimaginable filth that the child is is
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
coming to school repeatedly right so
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
when we would call
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
DCF then what we what we hear on the
 
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
other line is oh well we know we know
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
that family and well she's doing the
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
best that she can or he's doing the best
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
that they can so would that they're
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can kind of
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
fall under where it says
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
here basically you know for reasons
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
other than like poverty is that is this
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
would would that still be the exception
 
01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.629 align:start position:0%
would would that still be the exception
here

01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
so when you have DCF involved DCF gets a
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
report of abuse and neglect they are
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
doing what they can to provide the
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
family with the services they need to
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
help that person be a better parent and
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
take care of their child whether that's
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
assistance through Wick or um support
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
with finding food or shelter necessary
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
care this is meant to address the people
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
that are ignoring that help and um a
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
child being harmed because their parent
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
is being neglectful in spite of the
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
resources that dcyf is providing them
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
for example I find experience in cases
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
quite frequently where you have DCF and
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's why I put this in here an active
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
safety plan to say um in order to be
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
provide for this child dcyf is
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
instructing you that you need to comply
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
with a safety plan that says you need to
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
do X Y and Z to make sure that your
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
child is safe this is to address the
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
parents that are saying no and putting
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
their child at risk anyway I think it
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
gives DCF some teeth um you know I think
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
these crimes on the books are meant
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
mostly to be deterrence to people to
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
commit for committing crimes and if dcyf
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
can say you know there will be
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
ramifications if you do not comply with
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
this safety plan and you never know the
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
police department could also bring
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
charges of criminal neglect against you
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that parent uh will then change
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
their mind and provide for that child
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
when there's an actual real threat there
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
to them I would Echo that and I think
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we see often
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
ignored in safety plans are
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
investigations of child sexual abuse and
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
in that instance usually the child is
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
safety planned out of the home home or
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
out of the care of the suspect uh often
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
times the parent the child is left with
 
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
continues to bring that child to the
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
suspect or let that person live with
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
them and that child sometimes not always
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
but sometimes under goes further abuse
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
and this law would allow us to do
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
something about that rather than simply
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
say there's not really a good way to
 
01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
charge that uh the only other place that
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
could be charged is a class A
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for a failure to report the
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you if if I could just clarify so
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is this this
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislation will actually make it easier
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
if indeed the person does have a plan
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
because I think you would agree a lot of
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
them do and it's blatantly obvious that
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
it is being ignored this will actually
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the state to be able
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
Sher uh any interest of full disclosure
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh Sullivan County attorney Miss hilard
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
has The Misfortune of having been a
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
student of mine
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
um we spoke
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
um yesterday I believe and I expressed a
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
concern with the word responsible in
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
line five uh and we agreed that uh a
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
better language would be the language
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
from the endangering the welfare statute
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
which we you would replace responsible
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
with um a duty of care protection or
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
support the person owes to such child
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct and I would also I
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know if I would say Misfortune
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
but I I did see you a lot over my three
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
years uh thank you well probably not as
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
much as we have yeah follow-up question
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
follow up it it remains to be seen to
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
the outcome of a a child abuse or
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
neglect proceeding in the D DC might be
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
the termination of parental rights so
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's an alternative to if the the
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
family the parents don't comply with the
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh plan of
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
DCF uh that's an alternative uh to a
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
criminal charge um is that fair to say
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh it is I don't know if I agree with
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
the term alternative it's a possible
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
outcome and it's a very lengthy process
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh I believe you cannot terminate a
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
parent rights until a year you've given
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
them a year to comply with a safety plan
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm sorry followup
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
um what I'm struggling with is
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
um that's one
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
outcome um the other outcome is a
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
criminal charge which might result in
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
incarceration uh I'm struggling
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
with that being a better potential
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
outcome than the uh the termination of
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
parental rights that's that's my concern
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
with the statute as a whole I understand
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
the concern of while that might be a
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
better outcome for the parent um I think
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the outcome for the child is what I'm um
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
I guess more more focused on I think
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration for some of the more minor
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
um fact patterns that you can imagine
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
that would fit under this statute uh is
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
a stretch I think most people that have
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
no criminal history or no um background
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
of being neglectful uh would have a an
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
outcome that reflected the behavior in
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
itself we also have a multitude of
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
resources in the criminal justice system
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
other than incarceration that I think
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
could help get a parent back on track
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
such as probation or deferred sentences
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
something that would give them a real
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
incentive to comply with um with the
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
safety plan with dcyf with being a
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
better less neglectful caregiver um so I
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:07.639 align:start position:0%
incarceration while it could be a risk
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
to the more egregious offenders um
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot more that we can do
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh again to motivate people to help be a
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
better parent and ultimately we want
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is deter this conduct
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh and keep it from continuing this
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
statute would also fall under the um I
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
think it's 650 won uh an nment standard
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
so if you had a misdemeanor um criminal
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
neglect of a child you did what you were
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to do you went on to have no
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
criminal history you could get this ma
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh matter uned in a matter of years for
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
class I misdemeanor the annulment window
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
is three years from completion of the
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
sentence so I do agree there is the
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
option DCF certainly has the option of
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
going down a path of terminating
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
parental rights but I would agree with
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
attorney Gad I think uh the county
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
attorney's office spends a lot of time
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
looking at not just the charged crime
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
but who is the alleged person committing
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
it and how do we best find a measure of
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
punishment deterrence and Rehabilitation
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
which is what the Supreme Court says are
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
the factors that make up a good sentence
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
and how do we ultimately prevent what is
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
happening from occurring again and you
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
see that two people are often not
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
treated the exact same they're treated
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
based off who they are uh and you see
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
that in you know drug cases uh simple
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
possession cases someone's not going to
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the House of Corrections for having a
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
couple of bags of heroin or fentol if
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
they have absolutely nothing else on
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
their criminal history even if they do
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
have things on their criminal history
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
it's very rare at least I would say in
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
my office that they're going to the
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
House of Corrections for that uh and I
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
think the same would happen here it
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
would also allow us to make complying
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
with dcyf a term of their sentence which
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
again provides more teeth to trying to
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
get them on the right path and to get
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
those children out of Harm's way sooner
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
than that year rather than putting them
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
through a whole year and having their
 
01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
through a whole year and having their
rights

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
terminated thank you a representative
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what I'm trying to
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
um gauge uh in in terms of the outcome
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
for the child right um what I'm trying
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to gauge is kind of I guess what is the
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh what is the standard for you know uh
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's easy to understand when we're
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
talking about uh matters of sexual abuse
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
um or you know something that is
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
straightforward like that when we're
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
talking about um food clothing uh
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
medical care I think a lot of these
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
things what I'm what I'm wondering is
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
what would uh what would the uh standard
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
have to be for someone to be charged
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
under this so it's a a negligent mental
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
standard which uh I would stress to the
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee is higher than a civil
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
negligence standard and that um standard
 
01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:55.639 align:start position:0%
comes directly from uh the New Hampshire
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court so in order to be
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
negligent you have to have um the
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
carelessness required for criminal
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
negligence is appreciably more serious
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
than that for ordinary civil negligence
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and its seriousness must be apparent to
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
anyone who shares the community's
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
general sense of right and wrong it
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
requires not only the failure to
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
perceive a more than ordinary risk but
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
also some serious blameworthy conduct so
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
we would be talking about only conduct
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
that falls under that um Supreme Court
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
definition of criminal negligence thank
 
01:23:24.159 --> 01:23:28.270 align:start position:0%
definition of criminal negligence thank
you

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you for taking my question
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
whenever a penalty is not a maximum
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
minimum how much discretion does a judge
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
have in
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
discretion as long as it's not a
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence the judge and the
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution has complete discretion we
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
have complete discretion what we offer
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the judge has complete discuss to
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't thank you for taking my question
 
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh many years ago I was on the school
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
board and we had a child who was
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
constantly in trouble at the bus stop in
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
the classroom on the playground
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
constantly in
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
trouble always coming up before the
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
school board his child was in the second
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
grade he lived with his
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
father come to find out the child was
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
being exposed to pornography on a daily
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
basis would that fit within this
 
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:53.070 align:start position:0%
basis would that fit within this
proposed

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
law sorry in court you have to hold it
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
to be muted I didn't realize I had to
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
turn it back on uh under the catchall
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
for necessary care I believe you could
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
um make an argument for that that it's
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh necessary care to provide that it
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
puts them at risk for a serious harm um
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
but I do think you'd need to as a
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutor get an expert to say exposure
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
to pornography put this kid at risk for
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh X Y and Z so um I do think that there
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
is an Avenue to do
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
that don't don't we already have a
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
statute um with regard to giving
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
pornography to
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
minors there's the obscene matter
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
statute which I've rarely ever seen
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
charged um and I'm not I think I've
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
looked at it before and showing it to a
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
child is not necessarily encompassed in
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
that but I'd have to check that to to be
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
honest with you there are statutes that
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh if you were to expose
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
yourself to a child that is covered but
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I in that statute I know it doesn't
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you some somebody ought to make a
 
01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
thank you some somebody ought to make a
law

01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you no further questions thank
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%

I've been a police officer for nearly 10
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
years and I currently serve as the
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%

Department I oversee all cases of child
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh abuse in our community uh hundred
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
handling hundreds of cases over my
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
career I'm here to testify in support of
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
H b257 establishing the crime of
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
criminal neglect of a child children are
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable victims in our
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
society they often lack the ability to
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves and when they do
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
they may not have a safe or supportive
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
adult to advocate for them becomes our
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility as Law Enforcement
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
Officers to be their voice and protect
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
them when they cannot protect themselves
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
the stakes are incredibly high in these
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
investigations if handled improperly the
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
consequences are not just serious they
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
are tragic childhood trauma can affect
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
every as aspect of a child's life often
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
following them well into adulthood in
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
the most devastating cases it leads to
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
death I poured everything into these
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
investigations my time my energy and
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
even my emotional and physical
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
well-being but despite our best efforts
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
as Law Enforcement Officers children are
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
still falling through the cracks time
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
and time again Law Enforcement Officers
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
across the state investigate cases of
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
child neglect that don't meet the
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
purposeful standard outlined in our
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
current statutes in these cases we are
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
left to file a report and pass it along
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
to an already overworked underresourced
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
DC a social worker hoping that our
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
findings will contribute to a civil
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
resolution under RSA
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
169c this is simply not enough dcyf
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
cannot continue to Bear the entire
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility of child protection we've
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
seen time and time again the tragic
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
consequences of a system stretched too
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
thin the social workers I work with are
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
some of the most dedicated and selfless
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
people I know but they are the first to
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
admit they cannot do it all we need a
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
stronger and more effective system I'm
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that every single case of
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
child neglect warrants criminal
 
01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:31.639 align:start position:0%
involvement there are certainly
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
situations where DCF can and should
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
provide resources such as parenting
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
classes or in Home Services however
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
there are cases where these efforts are
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
not enough many families are unwilling
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
to accept help and in these cases we as
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement are left in a
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
frustrating limbo this isn't just an
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
issue for me but for law enforcement
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
officers across New Hampshire who face
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
the same challenges and frustrations
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
within their own communities
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
in recent history the harmony Montgomery
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
case touched the hearts of every Granite
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
stator Harmony's life ended tragically
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
and her case brought to light broader
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
issues surrounding child neglect and
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
abuse while hers is a high-profile case
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
it is not unique I can tell you from
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand experience that there are many
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
children like Harmony children who are
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
suffering in silence whose situations
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
have not yet reached a point of a
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
headline but whose circumstances are
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
just as Bleak and just as dangerous
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
these children are living in neglectful
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
situations with the same potential for
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
harm but our laws do not law enforcement
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
the tools to intervene early enough to
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
prevent that harm after me you're going
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
to hear testimony from two grand
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
estaters who have been deeply affected
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
by child neglect I'll allow them to
 
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves however I do want
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
to relay um how these stories relate to
 
01:29:38.119 --> 01:29:39.189 align:start position:0%
to relay um how these stories relate to

HB
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
257 first case involves a child named
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
Sophia she was 9 years old and she
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
experienced the most horrific neglect I
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
have ever witnessed in my career if I
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
were to describe the details of her case
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
many of you would find it almost
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
impossible to believe and you'd likely
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
be moved to tears Sophia was a frequent
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
subject of DCF and law enforcement
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
intervention but the resources available
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
simply were not enough it became a horse
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
to water situation where help was
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
offered but the family refused to accept
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
it ultimately Sophia was rescued after a
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive multi-disciplinary
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
investigation but it never needed to get
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
to that point where that neglect
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
escalated to serious physical abuse if
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
we had the tools to intervene earlier
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
this child could have been spared much
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
emotional mental and physical trauma
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
then there's Charlotte tragically in
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
2023 due to a medical
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
complication while I was able to show
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that her death could have been prevented
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
we were unable to prove that her
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
caregivers directly caused that death
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
however what we could see was that
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
Charlotte had been neglected leading up
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
to her death and these patterns were
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
evident throughout that investigation
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
sadly we never had received any prior
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
reports about her however even if we had
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
under the current laws there would have
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
been little to no route for law
 
01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:50.910 align:start position:0%
been little to no route for law
enforcement

01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
intervention this bill HB 257 offers a
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
Solution by broadening the standard for
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution child neglect cases we can
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
address cases where neglect is occurring
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
but doesn't meet that narrow purposeful
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
threshold it'll provide Law Enforcement
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
Officers across the state with tools we
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
need to intervene earlier before neglect
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
turns into irreversible harm I urge you
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
to consider the safety and well-being of
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
the children in our state and take
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
action to close this Gap in the law our
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
children deserve more they deserve to be
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
protected and they deserve a system that
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
can act before it is too late in closing
 
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
I ask that you find this bill ought to
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
pass pass thank you for your
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you Sergeant any questions
 
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
time thank you Sergeant any questions
representative

01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
n thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
question um I one aspect I think that um
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to at least flesh out is that
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
uh on the parents part there might be um
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
an element of um mental health um that
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
there there might be a a mental health
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
component to the to the neglect right
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering in your experience
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
um in dealing with situations like this
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
is that something that you often find
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
and would you find even if this law
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
existed for the standard of of criminal
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
NE neglect um if there were an element
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
of uh mental health issues on the
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
parents part do you would that still be
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
handled in a different
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
way thank you for the question I think
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
that largely depends on what exactly
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
that mental health issue is obviously in
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
order for the state to pursue a
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution we would still have to prove
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that person is competent to stand
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
trial um so it it would depend on what
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that issue is it's no secret we
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
have a mental health crisis um in this
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
state um but that doesn't excuse um some
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the behavior mentioned um in this
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
statute however um this is also where um
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
the RSA 169c comes in as my colleagues
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
had testified earlier so when we talk
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
about the the Civil resolutions that can
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
fall into those civil resolutions the
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill as I said is not
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
to criminalize everything it's where
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate so in certain cases if the
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
parent has you know whatever that may be
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia that may be something that
 
01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
falls more into 169c and DCF offering
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
involvement and services um this is
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
meant to address the cases where you
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
know that's not really effective
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you that that's kind of
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to get to because
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
regardless you want to address the issue
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and intervene on behalf of the child
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
right but as a matter of you know
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
consequence for the parent um I think
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's comforting to know that there are
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
are different Avenues based on what the
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
situation is with the thank you thank
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
question you no further questions thank
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Tina Delorenzo
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm here with my husband Joel We are
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
from Claremont New Hampshire and I want
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
to thank you Mr chairman for allowing me
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak on behalf of my
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
family and this important bill changing
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
this law is incredibly important to us
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.239 --> 01:34:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
today

01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
sorry on behalf of my beautiful
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
granddaughter Charlotte Elizabeth
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
Ward Charlotte tragically passed away on
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
October 4th 2023 at the age of
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
five that day my son's life my life and
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
my husband's life changed forever we are
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
devastated by this loss Charlotte died
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
from a condition called toxic Megan
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
colon due to chronic idio ideopathic
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
constipation which caused her intestines
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
to rupture her little body became so
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
severely backed up that it led to a
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
fatal condition and she passed away from
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
the toxins that were released into her
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
system what makes this tragedy even
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
harder to Bear is the knowledge that
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
Charlotte could still be here with us
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
today if she had received the proper
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
care and
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
attention the child's
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
mother who should have had Charlotte's
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
best interest at heart failed to provide
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
the necessary Medical Care Charlotte's
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
condition was ignored she wasn't taken
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
to the doctor for necessary appointments
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
and she wasn't given the proper
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
medication instead her mother's Focus
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
seemed to be on her own desires drinking
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
partying and neglecting her daughter's
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
well-being the living conditions in her
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
home were also appalling when police
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
arrived at her mother's house that day
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
they condemned the
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
property there was dog and rat feces
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
everywhere throughout the house
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
including Charlotte's bedroom there were
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
bags and trash bags of trash piled up up
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
in every room and a dead dog in a crate
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
basement none of us knew this had cot in
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
this bad because when we we hadn't been
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
inside the home for over four years
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
after my son divorced her
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
mother as Charlotte lay in the ER I
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
promised her I would find justice fight
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
for her
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
justice her death was preventable and I
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
vowed that those responsible would be
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
held accountable but after the police
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
investigation we learned that this case
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
fell into a legal gray area it was clear
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
that Charlotte had been neglected and
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
that her caregiver had acted NE
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
negligently even recklessly but not
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
purposefully even though we could
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
clearly see that Charlotte's death could
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
have been prevented the the current law
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
failed to offer a route for prosecution
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
sorry the medical nect played a critical
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
role in her passing but under the
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
current statutes we are un unable to
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
prove that her mother caused charlot's
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
death under any of the homicide statutes
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
the legal language around purposely
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
violating a duty of care didn't allow us
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
to pursue charges even though the
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances of Charlotte's death were
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
directly linked to her mother's neglect
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
this left us in a position where Justice
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
could not be served and my granddaughter
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear this bill will not
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
bring Justice for
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
Charlotte but it can help prevent other
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
families from experience the same
 
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking loss I want to ensure that
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
the next time a child faces neglect or
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
abuse their parents and grandparents
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
won't have to face the harsh reality
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
that the law was not strong enough to
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
I ask each of you to take a moment and
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
consider the gravity of this
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
situation what if it were your child or
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
before you shared a meal hugged them or
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
heard their day heard about their day
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly they were gone never
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
to feel their little arms around you
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
again or hear them say I love you again
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
and what if the person responsible
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
simply moved on with their life without
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
consequences please take this bill
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
seriously change the language and the
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
law and give us the tools we need to
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
protect our
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
children no family should have to live
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
with the pain of knowing the their
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
promise to their child went unfulfilled
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
simply because of two words in the law
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%

her house at 9: let me give you a little
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
backstory she lived with my daughter and
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
myself until she was four her mother got
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
arrested we continued to care for her as
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
her Guardians until she was
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
six the way the law is written for
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
biological parents her father got her
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
who'd never met her but he got
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
her and then he refused to allow anybody
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
else in her life so even though I was
 
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
else in her life so even though I was
calling

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
calling
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
DCF every week every month can you do a
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
well check I haven't heard I I know
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
things are going on because I hear
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
rumors from other
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
people and part of sof's situation was
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
that um he locked her in her room
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
screwed the door shut put her in Diapers
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
at 9: because she couldn't leave the
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
room to go to the bathroom to leave her
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
house she had to climb in and out of a
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
ladder on the second
 
01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
floor she went to school when he felt
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
like sending
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
her she ate when he felt like feeding
 
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
her she didn't have clothes for the
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
weather in this time she ran away 22
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
times 22 to the police department who
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't help her because they had to
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
bring her home
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
they'd bring her home and her dad would
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
come up with some song and dance you
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
know it's just kids they do this stuff
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
or they wouldn't answer the door
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't answer the
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
calls and it just continued to
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
escalate finally
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
through numerous calls and the school
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
intervening because sof went to
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
school in the dead of winter
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
inadequately clothed she was wearing I
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
think she said sandals no jacket and
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
summer clothes because that's what she
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
room if any time that she had run away
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
those 22 times and there's a
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old walking around the
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
streets of Newport there was some place
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
in some law in place that said hey you
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
know that's not right you should know
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
what your kids do you should know where
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
they were and that's not that's not
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
allowable there were no consequences
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
well I shouldn't say that he got nine
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
months because they had to try him as
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse that was our choice if
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
we'd have pushed it to be tried as a
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
child abuse case Sophia would have had
 
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:07.709 align:start position:0%
child abuse case Sophia would have had
to

01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
testify she'd had enough crap in her
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
life and so one of the stories she talks
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
to me while I drive which is probably
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
for the best because she can't see my
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
face we're driving one day and she so
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Nana she wases you know sheetrock
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't taste
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
good okay how do you know
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
that oh well I was in my room for a
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
while and Dad wouldn't feed me so I
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
tried eating
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
sheetrock she say doesn't taste good
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't try it like okay so I
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
don't but I think for I mean she had a
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
good outcome we they rescued her my
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
daughter adopted her we removed the
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
but that takes time and in that two and
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
a half years with her father if month
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
one month two there' have been something
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
in place it wouldn't have escalated to
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
the trauma that she has to live with the
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
rest of her life she's doing well she's
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
in counseling but she has to live with
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
that the rest of her life we need to do
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
better we need to not have the should of
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
would a could
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
us because these little people don't
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the voice and
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
stories that were proven were not
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
stories if a nine-year-old went to
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
school and said well yeah I have to
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
climb a ladder to get in and out of my
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
house you'd think well you know that's a
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
story you're nine your parents would
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
never do
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%

opposes this bill because we believe
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
that this issue ought to be under the
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
child protection act for a couple of
 
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.350 align:start position:0%
child protection act for a couple of
functional

01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
functional
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
reasons effectively what this Bill runs
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
the risk of doing is criminalizing
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
poverty I know it says in the bill that
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
poverty is not a reason but when
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
children are living in a car with their
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
parents because that's all they can
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
afford or children are only eating at
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
school not at home because that's all
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
afford it still appears and in fact is
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
neglectful simply not willful neglect I
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
think the other reason is that when
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
parents do get caught up in the legal
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
system under this statute where it to
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
pass most of the parents we're talking
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
about likely will be represented by a
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
public defender they will likely plead
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
to the charges because they're not able
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
to afford proper
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
councel so it runs the the risk of the
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
folks that very folks we're talking
 
01:46:27.149 --> 01:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
about not having full access to the
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
system there are significant issues with
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
the child protection
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
act um the commission that I mentioned
 
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
and I won't get too far a field because
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is not child children and family
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
law we made numerous changes with the
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
commission including creating the office
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate including um
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
pushing for additional funding and
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing for a
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
DCF but we were styed when we tried to
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
broaden and strengthen the purpose and
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
definitions Clause of 169c 169 C2
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
specifically and what stamed US was case
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire case
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
law um gives deference to
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
parents the statute we were trying to
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
craft was to protect
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
children and while parents rights are
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
extremely important there is a basic
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
conflict if the courts give deference to
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
parents rights especially in these
 
01:47:32.239 --> 01:47:34.350 align:start position:0%
parents rights especially in these
situations

01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
um it's harder to protect children we
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
believe the department does have tools
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
to protect children
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
more but we also believe that the
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
department often is understaffed and
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
underresourced as has been stated today
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
making this a criminal statute is not
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
not going to protect more
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
children it's going to incarcerate
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
parents many of whom are doing the best
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
they can some of whom are incapable of
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
caring for their child but there are
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
already Provisions in statute to address
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
parents who are incapable or unwilling
 
01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
to care for their child the abandonment
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
statutes termination statutes as we've
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
heard about and while they're cumbersome
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're cumbersome for a reason our
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
system of justice
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
tries to give people the benefit of the
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
doubt tries to make sure we don't make
 
01:48:28.239 --> 01:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
doubt tries to make sure we don't make
rash

01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
rash
 
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
judgments my concern with this is that
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
this will catch up a lot of PE lot of
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
parents in the criminal justice
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
system and once you're in and snared in
 
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
system and once you're in and snared in
that

01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
system it is easy for folks of lesser
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
means to wind up bearing the full brunt
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
system we would be happy we would
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to refer this
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
to the children and family law committee
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
I can tell you there is currently a bill
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
before the children and family law
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee that is addressing the child
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
protection act there was a statutory
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee that uh concluded last fall
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the child protection act and
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
we will be more than happy to work with
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
children and family law to work on
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
filling the um addressing the gaps that
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
exist in the statute and with that I'll
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
n thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
question um I'm curious uh I'm actually
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
kind well I guess you could call me a
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
social I work at a transitional family
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
shelter um so of course I'm a mandated
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
reporter and things like that um in a
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the situations that I've seen um
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
I think a lot goes
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
into what is what is causing it right
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
and so that I think that's really what
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at with the standard
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
and um you know how we address things
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
and and maybe address them in different
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
ways and so my question um you know that
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
has been what I'm trying to get at um in
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
my question so far and so I guess to you
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
my question is do you are you not
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
satisfied um with the what has already
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
been clarified um that there would be um
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
different courses of action based on
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
different back
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
patterns thank you representative for
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
the question and I think you know our
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
our criminal code our statutes give law
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement an incredible amount of
 
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
discretion that's
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate but then we're asking law
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement to make a determination of
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
which parent is neglectful and which
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
parent is
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
not in fact the commission I mentioned
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
before it it formly was police
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
departments fielded after hours
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
calls for abuse and neglect reports
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
that was the way the department dealt
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
with it before the the
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
commission that we ask law enforcement
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
to do a
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
lot and they do a lot with a little as
 
01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
lot and they do a lot with a little as
well

01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
unless law enforcement has appropriately
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
trained uh
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
therapists asking law enforcement to
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
determine neglect is just a it's beyond
 
01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
Sher have we talked with the uh the
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys at the Children's Law Center
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh about this bill I have not I'm simply
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
representing my
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
appr I'm kind of baffled by your
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that you think it's okay for a
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
child to sit and wait in neglect and
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
keep being abused while a cumbersome
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
system tries to figure it out which from
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
what I've seen doesn't do a very good
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
job at
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
all and now we want to provide law
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
tool to help save this these
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
children and you're against it is that
 
01:52:20.119 --> 01:52:22.830 align:start position:0%
children and you're against it is that
correct

01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative and I think you misheard
 
01:52:25.079 --> 01:52:25.750 align:start position:0%
representative and I think you misheard
my

01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:29.719 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't think so we don't as I
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
said we've been involved in trying to
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
address the child protection system for
 
01:52:33.199 --> 01:52:35.310 align:start position:0%
address the child protection system for
many

01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
years we don't believe that
 
01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.629 align:start position:0%
years we don't believe that
criminalizing

01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
criminalizing
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
parents is the way to do that you know
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
we we formerly criminalized parents and
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
could have arrested parents for their
 
01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
kids being
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
Trent right it's obviously different
 
01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.030 align:start position:0%
Trent right it's obviously different
still

01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.750 align:start position:0%
still
neglectful

01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
neglectful
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
but when families break down it's not
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
for a single reason it's for many
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
reasons and yes we have to protect the
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
children but at the same time we should
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
not be infringing on the
 
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
parents so that's more closely what I
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah right so who should we be
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
infringing on if not the parents who are
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
creating the neglect I'm kind of
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
confused there thank you for the
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
question and as I as I mentioned DCF can
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
do more than they do under
 
01:53:39.199 --> 01:53:41.629 align:start position:0%
do more than they do under
statute

01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
the I I'm I'm struggling representative
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to testify as
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
though I'm sitting in front of the
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
children and family law where I would
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
get into particulars of the child
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
protection act that's not what this
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee is doing I just want to make
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
it clear that while I don't think this
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
is a criminal justice issue I do think
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue that needs to
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
be actively addressed by the children
 
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
and family law
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else wishing to test
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
find this spill who wasn't oh I'm sorry
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
ahead something that strikes me in other
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
other laws where we deal with people in
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
poverty one of the things that we will
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
do periodically is write in uh some type
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
of an exemption or some type of
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
clarifier uh for example for for people
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
who are Indigent so if we were to do
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
this with this particular statute it's
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
not like giving people a get out of jail
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
free C but um a directive that uh the
 
01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
court will take into account in the
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
economic status of the people I'm not
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how we would word this uh
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is as I can see why
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
this would be a concern and we we we
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to criminalize poverty on the
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
other hand we don't want to non-criminal
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
eyesee criminal activ activity which I
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
think we've heard is going on here so um
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if that if if there
 
01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
was a way to address that in the
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
language of the bill would that satisfy
 
01:55:13.199 --> 01:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
language of the bill would that satisfy
your

01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
concern thank you for the question
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative the devil's always in the
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
details I think every
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
nearly all of these criteria under uh
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
poverty it's not clear to me although I
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
would NE never foreclose an opportunity
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me how you would craft
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
the language you're you're talking about
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
but we certainly would be happy to take
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
a look at that and revise Our Testimony
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
if that were appropriate given what you
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
came up with thank
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else wish to testify
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill who was not done so please
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
approach do you have a card for we need
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
a pink card for you
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair for the record
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
state representative hope Damon I serve
 
01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
half of Sullivan County um I'm here as a
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill and
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
appreciating how complicated the
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
considerations of our multiple
 
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
constituencies are on this I would just
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
like to say I would like the committee
 
01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.470 align:start position:0%
like to say I would like the committee
to

01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
seriously evaluate the language of the
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill and the intent and respect that we
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
need to do a much better job of
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
protecting children than what we're
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
currently doing and while that certainly
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
should include better access to Social
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
Work Services my personal belief is
 
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
including them in police departments
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
would be a vast step forward in meeting
 
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
families needs
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
and better funding and services through
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
DCF in a much more timely manner we
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
can't wait for that to happen we have to
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
protect kids today and Mr chair if I may
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
the um County attorneys would like to
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
come back and clarify in regards to the
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
permissible I'm going to appoint a
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I don't think it's
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
necessary we'll we'll hear what they
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you and thank you all
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
for your work yeah thank you with that
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
and no one else wishing to testify um
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
I'm appointing a subcommittee on this
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
and I will be chairing the subcommittee
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
and the members will be representative
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
Murphy Murray myself and representative

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and I open the public hearing on
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill for what's

that why
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
would never mind five minute

would never mind five minute
break

I opening the public hearing on House
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 405 and I invite the prime sponsor
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
approach thank you for the record my
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
name is Erica Leon I'm a state
 
02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative from Derry entering my
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
third term uh that's relevant because
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
all through the time I've been in office
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
people have been trying to approach deal
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
with these massage parlors and other
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
things where it's pretty obvious what's
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
happening behind closed doors but nobody
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
has the tools to address it um I know
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
that many heads are better than one and
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
many committees are better than one
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
because I'm now on executive departments
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
and administration which has dealt with
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
this process through the licensing and I
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
know that there are other committees and
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
other approaches that have tried to look
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
at the fact that there are places where
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that sex is being sold
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
and bought in our State and we can't
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
touch it with our existing laws I put
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
together this study committee so that we
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
can actually get the right people in the
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
room so that we can have a long longer
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
and more focused look and figure out how
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
we can actually find some approaches
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
that will work and we remove this
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
problem I I know that just addressing
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
store Front sex traffic trafficking
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the entire process and
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
the entire problem that we have um with
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
especially the non-consensual purchase
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and sale of sex but the does address one
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
of those areas that impacts places like
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
my town of dairy we have many many shops
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
where the windows are covered over
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're supposedly offering services but
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
you can't actually walk in and make an
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
appointment and I've had people in the
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
community tell me that they have gone in
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
and theyve turned over during a massage
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
and an area they did not want touched
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
was touched we need to make sure that
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and everybody else who
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
needs to have the tools in order to
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
address this are able to do so because
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
this should not be happening so um I
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
basically I brought this forward and I'm
 
02:08:58.589 --> 02:08:58.599 align:start position:0%
very happy to see the turnout behind me
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
I'm simply a vessel to ask you to put
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
together the study committee and let the
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
smarter people who can better handle
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
this situation try and find some
 
02:09:09.390 --> 02:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
solutions so I'm happy to take any
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
questions have have you brought anyone
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
from your law enforcement Community
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
today to testify um I did not but I know
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
our Town Administrator is here I know
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of police are also here um
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I I expect that people would be
 
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
coming in for those committees thank you
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
um representative Ro you had a
 
02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you Mr chairman
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
actually mentioned something that I I
 
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask which was in both of our
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
first terms there was a bill that came
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
to Ed Edna that they were hoping that
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
would actually address this sex
 
02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking phenomenon and that that
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
bill was sent to interim stud and then I
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
believe it just it just died so my
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this has been
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
looked at this has been studied I know
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
the Coalition has done a lot of work on
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
and the police officers have done hours
 
02:10:08.189 --> 02:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
and hours and hours so one was what what
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
exactly are you looking for from the
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
study committee because if we can
 
02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
actually just make this be a bill to to
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
regulate those businesses so the so that
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
the people can actually get in and do
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
their jobs and save the people that need
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
saved could we just do that instead of
 
02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:25.559 align:start position:0%
wasting more time and not having
 
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
anything happen well thank you that's a
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
very very good question I only been on
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
Edna for a few weeks I had not been in
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
the licensing area before however um
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
when you look at it a lot of people who
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
are sort of professional law Breakers
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
know how to skirt up to and right along
 
02:10:45.069 --> 02:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
the edge of what is legal and what is
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
not legal um I think that we need to
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
have not only licensing but we need to
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
have other people involved in this
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
because one of the areas that I thought
 
02:10:54.990 --> 02:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
might work would be to have a solution
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
where if this is going on and if they
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't if the you can write it into your
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
lease agreement that if they don't
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
consent to inspections if it appears
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
that they may be participating in this
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the landlord can terminate that
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
lease and so that's something that would
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
go outside of Edna because the landlords
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
are often renting space to these
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
businesses they may not know what's
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
going on and the leases I I don't
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
believe they can just kick somebody out
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
because they don't like the business
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
that they're doing um a lot of times we
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
have lease terms I know that's being
 
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
heard in judiciary for residential but
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
for commercial as well especially when
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
you're investing in building out a
 
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
business you're going to expect to be
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
able to stay there for a certain amount
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
of time however if you have these these
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
posters up on your window and up on your
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
wall even if you're able to skirt any
 
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
regulations that we do have on the
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
licensing side we should also have the
 
02:11:45.629 --> 02:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
tool of allowing a landlord to terminate
 
02:11:48.510 --> 02:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that lease if they are not going to
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
submit to searches if there is a strong
 
02:11:53.069 --> 02:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
expectation that this is what's
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
happening I want to look at not just one
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
approach but I want this study committee
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
to have sort of an all of the above
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
approach because professional law
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
Breakers will come right up to that edge
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh they will find the ways to work
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
around this and we need to have a m
 
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
multifactorial approach because just one
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
approach is just going to have them
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
shift their business
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
model thank
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:12:42.549 --> 02:12:42.559 align:start position:0%

02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
testimony I am Jody Nelson I represent
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh Derry there are going to be a lot of
 
02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
people um who will be testifying who
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
will be giving um you know a lot of
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
details I'm not going to waste your time
 
02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
and just with that because I know that
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
they will be providing you with more
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
information um I and and maybe ideas
 
02:13:03.069 --> 02:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
about tools um that we can use to um
 
02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
help solve this issue I have been uh
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
working for the past couple of years
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
with um our town and we did um they did
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
pass an ordinance they thought would be
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to um at least somewhat fix this
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
problem and it's just not enough we
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
really need some sort of um help um on
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
the on the state level with uh with some
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
laws uh these people uh in in terms of
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
your question representative roads
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
um what I'm finding uh what I'm hearing
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
is that there are um these folks who
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
are not only
 
02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.430 align:start position:0%
are not only
now

02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh being licensed in Body Works which is
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
what um was concentrated on in the prior
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh bills they're now moving into saying
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
that they're estheticians and giving
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
scalp massages and there's one in our
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
town and also I am hearing that nail
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
salons are also um providing these um
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
Services I just find it's extremely um
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
disturbing we're having human
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
trafficking in our own towns in New
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and nobody seems to care about
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
these women um you know I I drive by I
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
walk by these shops every day knowing
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
from all the research that I'm done that
 
02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of these people women
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
working here are trafficked and they
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
live in these shops they are not allowed
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
to go out they are afraid because
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're threatened that if they say
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
anything to police or ask for help
 
02:14:47.709 --> 02:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to get in trouble they're
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to be arrested they're going to be
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
deported or worse I also wanted you to
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
know that there are some landlords who
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely know there is illegal
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
um operations happening um and these
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
people frequently pay in cash for a full
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
year or for the term of their lease so
 
02:15:09.069 --> 02:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
that's really appealing to some lanlord
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
and they simply just turn a blind eye I
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
also wanted to let you know that um I
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
monitor certain um chat rooms there are
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
people who go to these places in New
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they talk
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
about sex acts that are performed in
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
specific locations how much they pay
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
what the names of the women are um and
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
something also that we need to talk
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
about is this is a public health issue
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are sex acts that these people are
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
describing hundreds and hundreds of
 
02:15:49.709 --> 02:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
pages I tried actually to figure a way
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
to share this with you
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
and even redact trying to redact um
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
certain portions it was just
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um you know if you're
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
interested I'm sure you can find find
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
them on your own there are acts that are
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
talked about constantly on these chat
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
rooms where there is no protection being
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
used so this is a public health issue
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
for the partners of these people who are
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing illegal sexual acts from
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
these women and also for the women who
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
are uh not being protected as well um
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%

representing
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
der Rockingham County 13 but also I'm a
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
town counselor and have been for for the
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
last three terms um for the last seven
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
years or so I've been working with our
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
economic development director Bev
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
Donovan and we've trying to been you
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
know tackling these and chasing this
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
thing around um and it appears every
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
time the town has some kind of footing
 
02:17:43.389 --> 02:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
to go in and try to um absolve some of
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
these businesses the ownership changes
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
every few months they change names they
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
change locations uh we we have people in
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
town who help brokering different
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
locations for them um and as far as
 
02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
locations I mean we have a couple
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
literally feet away from town hall we
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
have one that directly abuts a school
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
the back the back property line um but
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of these locations they're in uh
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
locations with reputable businesses
 
02:18:13.469 --> 02:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
that's bringing down those business
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those individuals we
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
have um a lot of uh issues going on with
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
this I think we currently have not
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
to give it any uh gloat but we have nine
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
of these businesses in town currently as
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
of today and it's not just a dery
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
problem it's
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
not just us so if we eradicate this in
 
02:18:37.469 --> 02:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
Derry they're going to go to the next
 
02:18:38.669 --> 02:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
town or the next town they're going to
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
go to your little small town so this is
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
a literally not just a dairy Town issue
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
or a Statewide issue this is actually a
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
national issue this is a there's human
 
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking going on here this is a very
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
problematic issue um representative
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
rhods I agree with you I'd be amendable
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
to having a bill to address this and
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
finally give some teeth to whatever it
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
is we need to do to protect these these
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
individuals um as far as landlords we
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
have some landlords who are complicit
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
whether be by being absentee landlord or
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
by turning a blind eye so this is a a
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
real problem uh um like representative
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
Nelson said our town administrators here
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
and and maybe give you a little more
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
technical aspect to that but I just want
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
to come here and Adam ly support this
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill and I would hope that you would
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
support it as well thank you for your
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%

you um thank you that's thank you the
 
02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:44.120 align:start position:0%

Karen good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
your time I did submit testimony last
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
evening I hope you're all received it so
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
I'll try to just hit the highlights is
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
that uh as as a counselor and
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative footstep we have about
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
over a half a doz of the establishments
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
here through our in Dairy through our R
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
advertisements and non-conventional
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
websites we do know what's occurring and
 
02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
there's got to be more coordination
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
between the state and communities to
 
02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
make this work we did pass an ordinance
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
that ordinance uh has been somewhat
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
ineffectual uh it did give us the
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to inspect the premises but
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
the not without notice uh as you know
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
with with due process so you know the
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
coordination between the state and the
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
towns would be critical for this uh we
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
convened our team in Dar of of our chief
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
of police our code people Economic
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
Development and we quickly came up with
 
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
a list of 30 suggestions to make help us
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
make this no longer under the Hampshire
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
problem among those was think of the
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
state liquor enforcement will you have
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
enhanced review of ownership management
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
location employe employees uh we need to
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
review and enhance penalties for
 
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
violations of trafficking and
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
prostitution we also need enforce
 
02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
capabilities to enhance those and
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
resources at the office for professional
 
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
license ear and
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
certification we also recommend you
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate any Reciprocity for licenses
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
with other states because most of these
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
problem establishments uh come from out
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
of state uh and make make no uh make no
 
02:21:17.710 --> 02:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
mistake there are some long-standing
 
02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
massage uh uh licensed folks and D
 
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
who've been there forever who run
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate businesses we also want to
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
make sure they don't get caught up in
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh uh legislation what would
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
really help us because a lot of these
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
establishments jump from Community to
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
community is that a Statewide database
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
of licens applications and employees uh
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
would really help us in this cause you
 
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
know in the past our law enforcement
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
folks our chief police has been very
 
02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
active he's been working with the
 
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security on a lot
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
of these issues however what what the
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
problem is is that these investigations
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
are lengthy and due to often times
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
language barriers and the refusal to
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
coorporate uh from the witnesses and the
 
02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
victims on both sides we usually don't
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
make do we usually don't uh result in a
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
favorable outcome we think a better
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
approach is to have a very strict
 
02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
licensing process where you have a
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
person who is licensed to one particular
 
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
location and they have to go back to the
 
02:22:19.710 --> 02:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
state to get it changed we think that's
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
going to give us more opportunities to
 
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
succeed and make sure that the only
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
massage establishments established and
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
operating in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
are those legitimate businesses so if I
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
can offer a suggestion to uh hopefully
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
improve the bill is I was suggest that
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
you expand the membership to include
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
somebody from law enforcement
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
potentially appointed by the Hampshire
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police and also somebody from
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
the code side either appointed by nhma
 
02:22:48.349 --> 02:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
or by the New Hampshire building
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
officials Association I love to be able
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
to have this problem solved tomorrow but
 
02:22:56.429 --> 02:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
candidly I think it's more complex we
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
number one we want to make sure we get
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
it right and number two that we don't
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
create hardships for those legitimate
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
massage businesses which which are
 
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
operating throughout the state I'd be
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead representative
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
Sal thank you for taking my question um
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
could be anecdotal but what percentage
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
of these
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
workers are illegal
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants I don't have information on
 
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:38.920 align:start position:0%

02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15,000
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
survivors of sexual and domestic
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
violence annually and include um victims
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
of human trafficking as well um I'm here
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
to testify on hb45 which seeks to
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
address um the illicit businesses that
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
enable sex trafficking to occur in our
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
state um we thank rep Lon for bringing
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation forward and we support
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
this bill with an amendment ideally um
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
there have been extensive conversations
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
about this issue over the past few years
 
02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
and we asked the committee to um really
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
take action today I think there you'll
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
hear several concrete proposals that I
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
think we can definitely work with you to
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are finally getting um to
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
these key issues um previously this
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
legislation has gone to other committees
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
as you've heard and we think uh your
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee is particularly poised um from
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
a public safety lens to really address
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
um this critical issue and we understand
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you know how Insidious these crimes
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
are um and how you all are uniquely
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
positioned to really do something here
 
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
today and so we're ready to work with
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%

here to provide information again
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
related to hb45 and to support Pamela
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
with providing some potential policies
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that could help enhance our
 
02:25:59.389 --> 02:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
anti-trafficking work that we're already
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
doing around the state the reality as
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of you know is that there
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
are many many types of human trafficking
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
happening here in New Hampshire the task
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
force has identified trafficking in
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
every County um age um victims aging
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
from very small children to the elderly
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
um both American Nationals and foreign
 
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
citizens um the forms of a range from
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
Forced and coerced agricultural labor to
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
forced prostitution for several years
 
02:26:27.870 --> 02:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
the task force has been leading an
 
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
effort to combat elicit massage
 
02:26:32.269 --> 02:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
businesses elicit massage business is a
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
term that was created by the Polaris
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
project the national human trafficking
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
hotline um organization and it describes
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
a very specific type of exploitative
 
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
organized commercial front trafficking
 
02:26:45.269 --> 02:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
venue that they saw implicated over and
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
over in cases reported to the hotline
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
the term does not Encompass legal
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage businesses nor does
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
it include non-coercive sex work that
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
may incorporate
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
massage while we're aware that these
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
businesses exist in our state it's been
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult to initiate a human
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
trafficking investigation in these
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
situations human trafficking prosecution
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
relies really heavily on victim input um
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
and in the absence of a stable secure
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
victim and by that I mean a victim who
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
both is and feels safe uh from their
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
trafficker it's nearly impossible to
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
gather the information that we need to
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
bring a case uh we do have members of
 
02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement here with us today who
 
02:27:23.070 --> 02:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
serve on the human trafficking task
 
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
force so they're going to provide
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
additional information about the
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
challenges that they face when they're
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
responding to these
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
situations um it's a priority of the
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
Coalition in partnership with the task
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
force and other stakeholders to connect
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
as many of these victims and survivors
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
in these situations as possible with
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
services that can help raise them out of
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
Crisis we know that these businesses are
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
operating around the state and the
 
02:27:44.349 --> 02:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
victims in these situations are really
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
carefully controlled and monitored and
 
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
they have very little opportunity to
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
seek help let alone to research what
 
02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
options might be available to them
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
traffickers have a massive amount of
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
control that they exert over these
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
victims in many elicit businesses the
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
victims are immigrants to this country
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and traffickers can exploit their
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
social and cultural norms and their
 
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
relative lack of contacts and social
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
supports and local resource knowledge
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
here um as well as a fear of removal
 
02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
from the United States to be able to
 
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
keep that victim isolated and compliant
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
so it's you know there's extra barriers
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
to some victims in these situations and
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
also some of them might not speak
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
English which again is is obviously an
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
extra barrier traffickers do also tell
 
02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
victims that seeking services or
 
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
reporting to law enforcement would open
 
02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
them up to prosecution because they're
 
02:28:30.429 --> 02:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
engaging in prostitution you'll hear
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
more from our Law Enforcement Officers
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
about this this is not a priority when
 
02:28:36.190 --> 02:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
they are um finding victims in these
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
cases and trying to support them um so
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
but the trafficker will make it clear
 
02:28:42.269 --> 02:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
that the only path that they have to
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
safety is by compliance what with what
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
the trafficker is demanding um so this
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
is why we do have a multidisiplinary and
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach when it comes to
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
to these
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
cases um I think as you've as you've
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit already and as you
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
will continue to hear this uh this
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh we have put significant
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
resources and expertise into
 
02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
understanding these issues already um
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I think we already have a good sense
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
of who all the stakeholders are and what
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
their input is to solving these issues
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
um I think you know there are a lot of
 
02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
folks unfortunately who have had Direct
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
experiences trying to address this issue
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the state um many national
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
organizations have also researched this
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
issue thoroughly um and what we've
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
identified as some of the best policy
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
approaches have been heavily vetted and
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
adopted by other states um so the New
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature has been a leader
 
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
in addressing human trafficking in our
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
state um and this legislature um this is
 
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
now an opportunity to not just study um
 
02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
these illicit businesses but really take
 
02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
action um because um without action we
 
02:29:44.590 --> 02:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
continue to see the exploitation of
 
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
individuals in our state um we would be
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee to
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
develop language um based on one of our
 
02:29:53.269 --> 02:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
our proposals um such as um raising the
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
penalty for facilitating prostitution in
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire providing licensing
 
02:29:59.269 --> 02:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
oversight um to these businesses and
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
others um that you've heard here today
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
um we are ready to be a resource and
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
really hope that you all will consider
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
um helping us eradicate this problem
 
02:30:09.269 --> 02:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
from our state um thank you so much and
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
no thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:30:19.359 --> 02:30:20.469 align:start position:0%
no thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
um my concern is around um uh people who
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
do have uh potentially a a precarious
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
documentation situation and so I guess
 
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
my question is are there um are there
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
protections for women who are in this
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
situation who may not uh be documented I
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
think the fear of of being removed from
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
the country is very real do we have
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
protections around that so people feel
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
safe uh to be able to come forward yeah
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely a real fear and you
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
know the fact that we have it doesn't
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
mean people know about it um we there is
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
there is a t visa for victims of human
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
trafficking um the phrasing of that can
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
be confusing because it talks about
 
02:30:59.550 --> 02:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
serious forms of trafficking but the
 
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
definition it includes any trafficking
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
um so that does exist but like you say
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
it is a barrier for people and I think
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh like Meg shared earlier our primary
 
02:31:10.269 --> 02:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
goal and why we have a
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary approach in the state
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
so part of the task force it like Meg
 
02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh Child Protection Services
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's Advocates at crisis centers its law
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement its prosecutors um and so on
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
um part of that is to really look at
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
this in a comprehensive and
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um victim centered way um to ensure that
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
people are getting directed to resources
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
and offenders are being held
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
accountable I've done some research into
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
this myself and it is it not true
 
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
that these These are being run by large
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
criminal organizations it's not
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily just you know one Madam it
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's organizations and they're taking
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
these women from countries in Eastern
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
Europe and Asia and they're bringing
 
02:31:59.950 --> 02:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
them over here they didn't ask to come
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
over here and many of them um are under
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
threat not just of themselves of being
 
02:32:07.269 --> 02:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
deported because some of them frankly
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
would be happy to go home but their
 
02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
families back home are threatened as
 
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
well if they cooperate with law
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement so it's very difficult to to
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
reach these these poor people to to help
 
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
them because they're under such threats
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
from such large criminal organizations
 
02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
has that been your experience as well
 
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think our uh law enforcement
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
experts will be able to speak a little
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
bit more to what they're seeing directly
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I think that's why
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
um there's sort of two different like um
 
02:32:35.230 --> 02:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
rep Leon mentioned in the beginning um
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
two having a very comprehensive approach
 
02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's not just a law enforcement response
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
but a regulatory response as well just
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'll just quickly add to that if I may
 
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's also you know that's one of the key
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
things that we focus on as a task force
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
and prioritizing is meeting the victims
 
02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
where they are and and following what
 
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
they need so you know it may be that one
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
of our Task Force officers encounters a
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
victim who's really uncomfortable with
 
02:32:58.030 --> 02:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement they're going to get
 
02:32:59.269 --> 02:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
them connected with an advocate and
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
figure out what they need in that
 
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
situation it's not well you're with law
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement now and that's that's where
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
you stay I just wonder if we maybe it's
 
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um law of supply and
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
demand and maybe we need to focus a
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more on the demand and and
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
these people that are that are taking
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of these these women need to
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
maybe face a much different pen
 
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:24.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
very

02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
much well representative Muse you really
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
got to raise your hand higher thank you
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
um you had said at the beginning of your
 
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that you supported the bill
 
02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
with an amendment What specifically
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
would your Amendment do yeah we are
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
happy um there's a couple of different
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
policy proposals that have been
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
introduced in the past and have been
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
discussed with experts um um so we are
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
kind of looking to see what the
 
02:33:53.070 --> 02:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
committee is amendable to do we think
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
that this is a huge issue and it
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
definitely merits the attention that
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's receiving um but I think we have
 
02:34:01.389 --> 02:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
some concrete actions that we can take
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
today like I mentioned um potentially
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the penalties um other states
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
have lower penalties and that's allowed
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be sort of an open
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
doormat oh sorry higher penalties so
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's allowed um New Hampshire to kind
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
of be an open doormat for some of these
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
businesses um but also um the the
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory processes um so that we can
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
identify and respond in a more timely
 
02:34:26.349 --> 02:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
manner as you heard criminal
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
investigations often take a long period
 
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:29.840 align:start position:0%

Dave

McCormack my name is Dave McCormack I'm
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
a task force officer with us Department
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
of Homeland security I'm also an
 
02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
auxiliary trooper with the New Hampshire
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
State Police that's after doing 32 years
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
with the state police I retired as a
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant running the intelligence
 
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
unit um I've been on the task force for
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
six years since
 
02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
2019 and that's my background and we're
 
02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
here today to mirror what the Coalition
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
said um we don't think there needs to be
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
a study we just think that we have
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
enough information to do some some
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
actionable things today um I think
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
licensing is hug huge I think
 
02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
um I think having uh laws in place that
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
would maybe put these people in fear of
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh opening an illegal massage type
 
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
business um some of the things we see is
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
States you know next to us have made it
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
a felony to operate a house of
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
prostitution and that caused a lot of
 
02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
those to pack up and cross the border
 
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
where it's just a misdemeanor um because
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a a a huge issue um if
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
we could mirror some of these it would
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
it would it would make it more difficult
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
um for them to open up and the the
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
penalty would obviously be more severe
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
too so um the licensing I think that
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
would help us um make these businesses
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
more legitimate um we have been taking
 
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
complaints from Chiefs of police across
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
the state for the last few years um
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
we've spent countless hours outside of
 
02:36:51.309 --> 02:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
massage parlors um it is a very was a
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
very tough um investigation to crack and
 
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it would just end
 
02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
up being a misdemeanor most likely um we
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
take the approach that these women are
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
victims so our first approach wouldn't
 
02:37:07.469 --> 02:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
be to go in there and look at them as
 
02:37:09.389 --> 02:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
you know a sex worker and charge them
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
with a prostitution charge because again
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
these are trafficking victims the
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
majority of them don't want to be there
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're forced there either to pay back
 
02:37:19.269 --> 02:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
a debt or somewhat against their will um
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're terrified of law enforcement
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're terrified to be um deported
 
02:37:25.389 --> 02:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
again we try to explain to them if
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
they'll even cooperate with us that we
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
can issue or assist them with FASTT
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
tracking a t visa so they could get
 
02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
citizenship but even that alone isn't
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
enough um some of these other women are
 
02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
trauma bonded to their traffickers where
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
they think that they're being taken care
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
of they think that they're doing a
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
service for this they think that you
 
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
know this person loves them um as far as
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
the Asian massage
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
parlors that's a little different um
 
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
these women typically are there to pay a
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
debt it's like a highin revolving credit
 
02:37:56.349 --> 02:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
card that debt will never get paid off
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
which causes that supply and demand if
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
they weren't there doing it people
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be lined up to go there again
 
02:38:05.269 --> 02:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
um if you did something with the
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
licensing if you did something um I know
 
02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
the town of the Derry wants you know
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
wants them all out but like they said
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
they can't just Kick the Can there is so
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
much money involved in this organization
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they'll just pack up and they'll go
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
to the next town and they'll open up a
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
new space B um the amount of money that
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
this brings in um is so high that if we
 
02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
do find them administratively through
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security they'll just hand you
 
02:38:30.429 --> 02:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and say thank you
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
um when we go to try to interview these
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
women they'll just say that they don't
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
speak English they cycle in about every
 
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
10 days and they all come from an area
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
of New York and they go up and down the
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
Eastern Seaboard and we could probably
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
teach a class on this for an hour and I
 
02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
know that your time is important we're
 
02:38:50.910 --> 02:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions um
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
specific questions anything throughout
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
the state we've we've assisted many
 
02:38:57.550 --> 02:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state with these
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
problems um and I think they look at us
 
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
like we should just be able to go in
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
there and shut them down but that's not
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
do can you tell me how involved has the
 
02:39:12.429 --> 02:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
um the local US attorney's office been
 
02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh I mean is have they been focused on
 
02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
this problem in Hampshire they have been
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got um complaints
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
directly from them um we've had
 
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
complaints directly from police Chiefs
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and residents um people have called the
 
02:39:28.510 --> 02:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
hotline people have called this directly
 
02:39:31.389 --> 02:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh the issue is um proving what's
 
02:39:34.349 --> 02:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
actually going on behind closed doors um
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
again there's plenty of online resources
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
that will tell you who's doing what
 
02:39:40.590 --> 02:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
where they're doing it but actually
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
getting in there and uh proving a case
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
tends to be extremely lengthy and
 
02:39:47.230 --> 02:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
difficult um I think a better route
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
would just to prevent them from being
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
there in the first first place sure um
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
have you had any success at all as far
 
02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
as um Prosecuting customers who are
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
actually utilizing these these services
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
so one thing I recommend to the local
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
agencies to try to be a thorn in the
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
side is what we call as John stops and
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
essentially you'll wait wait outside and
 
02:40:13.469 --> 02:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
when a customer leaves if they have a
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
violation youd pull them over and you'd
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
speak to them about what they just did
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
inside there the majority of them will
 
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
admit that you know they got something
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
um as far as a prostitution you know
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
charge I don't see a lot of towns doing
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
that to their
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
residents final question for me this
 
02:40:33.550 --> 02:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
this sounds I mean from what you've
 
02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
described and what I I know this sounds
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
like it should be a RICO case all day
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
long with them moving up and down the
 
02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
coast and what about the US attorney
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
them themselves the Attorney General
 
02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
have they been involved in this has
 
02:40:47.309 --> 02:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
there been any it seems like the awesome
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
power that we often complain from the
 
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
federal government would be great if
 
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:54.279 align:start position:0%
they'd use it here so one of our
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues worked a case I think it was
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
about two or three years he worked this
 
02:41:01.389 --> 02:41:01.399 align:start position:0%
it was Multistate um New York Boston um
 
02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
it took years to do and it was a Reco
 
02:41:06.349 --> 02:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
case and they had great success with it
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
um and then fast forward tried to work a
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
similar case I think he took was it500
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
or $800,000 cash um from this from this
 
02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh massage parlor business um um and
 
02:41:21.550 --> 02:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
then the court said there wasn't enough
 
02:41:23.070 --> 02:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
evidence and we had to give it right
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
back um it is very tough to prove
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
because again you need cooperation from
 
02:41:29.710 --> 02:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
the witness and you need evidence
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
against the owner now the owner
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
typically says I don't know what's going
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
on when I'm not here I tell them no no
 
02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
funny business and the women who in our
 
02:41:41.469 --> 02:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
eyes are victims will just tell you that
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
they don't speak English and then within
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
10 days they're gone you have mandarin
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
officers or
 
02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
translators it it would wouldn't even
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
matter because they're not going to
 
02:41:55.389 --> 02:41:55.399 align:start position:0%
cooperate represent
 
02:41:58.990 --> 02:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
Shear uh how does Federal immigration
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
law if at all uh treat undocumented
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who are victims of crimes
 
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
like uh the uh victims uh we don't we
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
don't look at anybody's we look at them
 
02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
as victims whether they're you know
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
undocumented or residents we look at
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
them as victims um we're not political
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
organization we don't we don't look at
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
Politics as that we look at these women
 
02:42:25.710 --> 02:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
as victims whether they're residents or
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
not and we'll get them the assistance
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
they need no matter where they came from
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
um if they're not here legally we can
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
offer them assistance to be legal um a
 
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the times that's what will build
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
that Rapport that's what will make them
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable um to work with us but it it
 
02:42:44.429 --> 02:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
is it is rare that um that they'll
 
02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
cooperate the government does offer a a
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
Visa specifically for victims of crimes
 
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:51.880 align:start position:0%

very first part of your testimony and I
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%

mirroring them where we don't we don't

think it needs to be studied we know
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything about this we we need
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
action we need to we need to change some
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
laws to to to make this easier to
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%

them thank you thank you rep uh the
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.830 --> 02:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
gay I'm just gonna speak I'm just going
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
to speak as a citizen who until a few
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
years ago was totally unaware that
 
02:43:59.550 --> 02:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
prostitution was taking place I just
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
thought that was in big cities where
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
there were syndicates of crime I didn't
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
realize they're in all our towns and
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
then the movie uh sound of
 
02:44:12.429 --> 02:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
Freedom was probably the best message
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the public uh one of the Angel
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
movies and it really spells out that
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
this is sex trafficking not just of
 
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
women who people like to say well they
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
chose to be in that business I'm very
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
happy to know that our professionals
 
02:44:31.469 --> 02:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
know it's not a choice even for the
 
02:44:34.349 --> 02:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
people who think that it's a choice
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
Americans not people who were uh
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
kidnapped when you find out there are
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
books written by the people who are
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
running the businesses on how to
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
manipulate um emotionally pliable women
 
02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
who think that these guys really love
 
02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
them and they come from a background
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
where they're desperate to be loved and
 
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
then they it's it's as strong a bond as
 
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
as a chain it takes a lot of effort for
 
02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
them to heal and understand that they
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
are being treated as victims and they
 
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
can get out but then it's even more
 
02:45:18.510 --> 02:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
devastating to know that they are
 
02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:19.910 align:start position:0%
devastating to know that they are
children

02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
who are trapped in
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
this it just makes it if if it wasn't
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
already bad enough it's a thousand times
 
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
worse to know that there are children
 
02:45:32.429 --> 02:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
who are are sex victims and they don't
 
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
have a way
 
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
out uh and they're brainwashed that
 
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
there is no way out and just like the
 
02:45:41.469 --> 02:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
women who are from other countries even
 
02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
if they could get out they're scared
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
that the that they'll be uh sent back or
 
02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
their families will be
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm with the I'm with the federales
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
behind me I'm already for some laws how
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
late can a law be submitted now this
 
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
session it's already too late to submit
 
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
new legislation I thought that there was
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
a an another another
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
category we can amend or we could make a
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment to new but there's
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
many methods to oh so there is a way but
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
not not introducing it as a new law
 
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
right right but there are ways to do it
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
well I would really recommend that so
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
much expertise now has been said to you
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
guys that I didn't say y'all okay so
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
much expertise has already been spoken
 
02:46:36.990 --> 02:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
here you have so much information even
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
if you can't write the total
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
encompassing book uh law that would
 
02:46:45.870 --> 02:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
touch all the ills it would be great to
 
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
write the most to uh pass the one it
 
02:46:52.269 --> 02:46:52.279 align:start position:0%
would give some immediate
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
tools that would be very oh and keep
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
studying it though do pass the bill as
 
02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
it is too because we do need much more
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive treatment and uh that's
 
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
the opening the door but let's open the
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
door and put a bill through um an
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
amendment so that our enforcement people
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
have some tools to start addressing
 
02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
these criminals
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
416 and invite The Honorable Rosemary
 
03:34:17.469 --> 03:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:34:20.590 --> 03:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
Rosemary rung I'm a representative of
 
03:34:25.389 --> 03:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 which is the town of
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
miramac and I got to tell you it's a
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
real treat to be in front of Criminal
 
03:34:32.189 --> 03:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
Justice this is my first bill and I
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
think all the other committees I've I've
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
presented to I've bored them silly about
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria Bloom so it's your turn
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
now um but uh as many of you aware the
 
03:34:46.349 --> 03:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
prevailance and uh of toxic
 
03:34:48.510 --> 03:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms in New Hampshire
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
Lakes is a growing
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
problem um it threatens not only the
 
03:34:55.630 --> 03:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
health of people and animals but also
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
our robust Lake economy last year the
 
03:35:00.910 --> 03:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
occurrence and duration of blooms were
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
the worst on record and this summer is
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
predicted to be as bad or Worse the
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
trend of increasing water temperatures
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
is the fundamental cause of toxic blooms
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
both here in New Hampshire and
 
03:35:19.349 --> 03:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
globally but there are many actions we
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
can take to reduce the nutrients that
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
feed cyano bacteria blooms specifically
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus HP
 
03:35:33.550 --> 03:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
416 addresses one of these actions by
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the intentional disposal of
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
yard waste into New Hampshire Waters
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
this practice is not common among
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
Lakefront owners but it does occur and
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
it contributes to the nutrient load that
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
our Lakes can no longer tolerate it is
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
important that it be specifically stated
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
in statute as a violation of the New
 
03:35:58.189 --> 03:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire clean Lakes program not only
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
will it help reduce the addition of
 
03:36:02.670 --> 03:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
nutrients to our Lakes but as
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
importantly it will Foster a culture of
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
Lake stewardship that everyone has an
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
individual responsibility to treat our
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
public resources
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
responsibly government cannot solve this
 
03:36:19.189 --> 03:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
problem of toxic cyanobacteria blooms
 
03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
alone this bill will put up guard rails
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak guard rails and speed limits
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
to establish what responsible behaviors
 
03:36:30.429 --> 03:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
are when AB budding or accessing New
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes now what I think the
 
03:36:37.229 --> 03:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill came to criminal
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
justice is that there is a fine
 
03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
component comp comp component and um
 
03:36:48.670 --> 03:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
enforce by quote peace officers that
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
language of Peace Officers already
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
exists within the clean Lakes program
 
03:36:56.189 --> 03:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
and and the drafting attorney had
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
Incorporated it in this but I do want to
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that I am open to
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
um submitting an amendment if that
 
03:37:09.070 --> 03:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
language is problematic for you um my
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
primary goal in this bill is to make
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
sure that when people do dispose of of
 
03:37:18.110 --> 03:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
yard waste in Lakes um that they
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that that's an illegal
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
activity and it's not something to be
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
supported um it also empowers Lake
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
Associations and Watershed associations
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
to step in to counsel Lakefront owners
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and contractors to the to let them know
 
03:37:37.389 --> 03:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
that that practice is against New
 
03:37:39.870 --> 03:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and with that I would be
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you could you um could
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
you tell me what what it would look like
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
what does an act like this look like is
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
it someone who's fertilized a lawn and
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're too close to the lake so runoff
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
happens or are they actually putting
 
03:37:56.229 --> 03:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
stuff in the lake they're actually
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
putting stuff in the lake um and it it's
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
very common in the spring uh when people
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
who are returning to their seasonal
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
homes are clearing off leaves and the
 
03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
leaf blower it's just it's very easy
 
03:38:12.070 --> 03:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier than hiring a
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
contractor or taking it and Hauling It
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
Off or composting it it's just really
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
easy to just blow it into the lake and
 
03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
those leaves and things that have been
 
03:38:27.070 --> 03:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
on LA on their lawn have probably picked
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
up whatever they sprayed on their lawn
 
03:38:30.670 --> 03:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
what makes that difference in the leaves
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
that fall on from the tree right into
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
the water that's right okay no that's a
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
good question well Mother Nature can
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
handle naturally natural additions to um
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
the Lakes um and we do have regulations
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
that restrict the use of fertilizers
 
03:38:49.630 --> 03:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
within that Shoreline protection Zone
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
but this and even if a a Lawn isn't
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
treated or there no pesticides or
 
03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
fertilizers just the organic um
 
03:39:00.910 --> 03:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
components of that yard debris going
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
into the lake contain nitrogen and
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and they settle to the
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
sediment to the bottom of the lake and
 
03:39:12.990 --> 03:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
as they disintegrate they um they make
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus available and
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's what cyanobac cyanobacteria uses
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
um as nutrients and also um you know
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
just the the the debris that's been
 
03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
there over decades centuries um that
 
03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
will release under certain conditions it
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
it it can that release of nitrogen and
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
phosphorus can be catalyzed when the the
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
bottom layer of water in a lake becomes
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
anoxic or it it lacks oxygen
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it's just we really can't control
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
the temperature of of the lakes and
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's this is a global issue but we
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
really need to work hard and people need
 
03:39:59.710 --> 03:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
to develop that um
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility that not to introduce
 
03:40:05.229 --> 03:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
something into a lake that mother nature
 
03:40:08.349 --> 03:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't intended for it to for it to go
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
so in other words we can't necessarily
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
fix the problem but there's no need for
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
us to contribute to making it worse
 
03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
exactly and that's what this bill does
 
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
and there is things in the shoreline
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
water quality protection act which
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
outlines other behaviors that are
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited like clear cutting trees um
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
on a shoreline because th that's very
 
03:40:32.830 --> 03:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
important to keep trees there one is
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
they uptake nitrogen and fertilizer for
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
their own growth but they also prevent
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
runoff and erosion and um and there's
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
other like fertilizer application is
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
also in that act but there's nothing
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
about about yard waste and it it seems
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
kind of minimal but it is a it is a
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
practice that need people need to know
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not permitted thank you
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
um representative uh I'm sorry but Sabor
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that close sh thank you sir that was
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
correct yes um question do we know what
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of the phosphorus and the
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
nitrogen getting dumped in of the total
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
do you know what percentage of that this
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
contributed from dumping exactly no I
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
don't believe it there's been any
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
studies on that it's it's actually a
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
behavior that people are pretty discreet
 
03:41:25.389 --> 03:41:25.399 align:start position:0%
about because I think innately they know
 
03:41:27.149 --> 03:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
that it's not something they should be
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
doing they should be hauling it off um
 
03:41:34.149 --> 03:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
but and and also the amount it's it's
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
each lake and river is very unique and
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
there may be some that have high
 
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorate that that come
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
from the sediment there it there may be
 
03:41:46.830 --> 03:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
some that's coming from um failed septic
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
systems so being able to know the amount
 
03:41:52.349 --> 03:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
of nitrogen and phosphorus that's being
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
introduced through those individual
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
activities is really difficult to
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
measure um and as far as what their
 
03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
impact would be um you know there in
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
some Lakes um uh runoff is the number
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
one issue and this you know something
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
like yard debris might be number 10th on
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
the list um but there's some Lakes where
 
03:42:16.510 --> 03:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
septics systems could be the number one
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
contributor so it's really difficult to
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
say how much of the yard debris is
 
03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
entering the lake but also how much of
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
an impact that whatever is is making
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
because that the impact is what would
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
vary thank you thank you I hope I
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
answered your question okay thanks
 
03:42:34.359 --> 03:42:36.149 align:start position:0%
answered your question okay thanks
representa

03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
representa
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
Muse a quick question are there are
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
there similar things in statute that we
 
03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
may already be doing that are analogous
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
to what you're trying to do here yeah so
 
03:42:46.110 --> 03:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the shoreline water quality
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
protection act um there there are
 
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
definitely like the cutting of trees
 
03:42:54.510 --> 03:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually a pretty um extensive
 
03:42:56.830 --> 03:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
formula for calculating what trees you
 
03:43:00.110 --> 03:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
can cut as far as the diameter uh or the
 
03:43:02.910 --> 03:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
circumference and the number per square
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
foot I forget there's a there's a pretty
 
03:43:10.429 --> 03:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
lengthy um calculation and then um there
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
there is regulations on the application
 
03:43:16.030 --> 03:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
of fertilizers
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but there's um you know there's
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
there's people here from Dees too that
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
would probably know those off the top of
 
03:43:29.309 --> 03:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you tell what
 
03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
was the impetus for you to sponsor this
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
bill was there a particular need or did
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
you see something that someone came to
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
me and said we need a law I'm sure
 
03:43:48.030 --> 03:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
people have come to each of you and said
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
we need this law and um he was very
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
frustrated with the pra seeing he lives
 
03:43:56.590 --> 03:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
on a lake and he was very frustrated
 
03:43:59.950 --> 03:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
seeing people doing this and I you know
 
03:44:01.950 --> 03:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
filed it away where we file things like
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
that in our head and then I was at um I
 
03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
have a seasonal Cottage on a lake and
 
03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
one day I saw like this island of leaves
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
go by and I realized that's not from a
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
leaves falling from a tree and
 
03:44:19.389 --> 03:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
and and then just observing the severity
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
in so many lakes last summer of the
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
blooms you know we need to do whatever
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
we can even though this isn't a
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
significant contributor to nitrogen and
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
phosphorus our Lakes it's it's one thing
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can do to decrease it and more
 
03:44:37.830 --> 03:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
importantly Foster a culture of
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
individual responsibility where people
 
03:44:41.710 --> 03:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
know what is allowed and what isn't
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
allowed and hopefully it makes them more
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
aware of how important it is not to put
 
03:44:48.269 --> 03:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
anything into a lake that mother nature
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
didn't intend to be
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
pette thank you thank you just follow up
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
do do you uh do you think that citizens
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire know that doing this is
 
03:45:07.630 --> 03:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
wrong I think many don't um I also think
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
it it may not necessarily just be New
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents it's people who live
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
out of state that just come up here
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
seasonally that are preparing their
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
properties for the summer um they may
 
03:45:22.110 --> 03:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
not be aware of New Hampshire laws the
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
way Granite Staters might be um and
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's the other nice thing about this
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
is um about putting it in statute is
 
03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
that local PE local Lake Associations
 
03:45:35.590 --> 03:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
and Watershed associations can
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
communicate this to their members and
 
03:45:38.590 --> 03:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
their neighbors and let them know you
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
know you're not allowed to do that
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
anymore because right now they can do
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that and um there is indeed yes I think
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
um you'll get a letter you may have
 
03:45:49.229 --> 03:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
already received a letter from
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott that's saying oh well
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
this is already in statute but if you
 
03:45:55.229 --> 03:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
actually go to that statute it's under
 
03:45:55.239 --> 03:45:56.149 align:start position:0%
actually go to that statute it's under
water

03:45:56.149 --> 03:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
pollution um they talk about the um you
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
can't put trees or parts thereof and it
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
and and that's at the end of a say it
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
says um uh it talks about disposal
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
including but not limiting limited to
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
bottles glass Crocker y cans scrap metal
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
junk paper garbage tires old automobiles
 
03:46:22.149 --> 03:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
are Parts thereof trees are Parts
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
thereof and so it's not a prominent part
 
03:46:30.189 --> 03:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
of Statute and it's um and so this bill
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
is trying to make that activity more
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
explicit and more inclusive of those
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
types of things someone would put into a
 
03:46:40.269 --> 03:46:40.279 align:start position:0%
lake you know it's not just a tree or
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
part of a tree it's saying yard debris
 
03:46:45.149 --> 03:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
people know what yard debris is um right
 
03:46:46.590 --> 03:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
now people could think oh I can't put a
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
tree in a lake well most people don't
 
03:46:51.149 --> 03:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
put a tree in a lake but boy they'll put
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of leaves in in a
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
lake trees actually provide great
 
03:46:59.790 --> 03:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
structure for bass
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
pette thanks for taking my question um I
 
03:47:06.670 --> 03:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
was just wondering you said most people
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
are doing this discreetly so how would
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
something like this ultimately do you
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
see something like this being
 
03:47:15.469 --> 03:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
enforced well I'll tell you there'll be
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's people on the lake who really
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
have a strong sense of responsibility to
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
conservation and to re and especially
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
reducing the contributors to
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms they will let them
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
know um that's where most compliance of
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
the law occurs is Lake Associations
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
neighbors um really educating other
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors you really you really can't do
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
that I know you've been doing it um but
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
did you know that it's now against the
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
law really something as simple as like
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
that it can be very successful in
 
03:47:54.030 --> 03:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
curtailing Behavior just like the the
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know part of the the statute that
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits cutting of certain uh number
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
of trees that's the the education
 
03:48:06.910 --> 03:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
component of having that in statute and
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
educating people about that probably is
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
more successful than anything in
 
03:48:15.630 --> 03:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.590 --> 03:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.030 --> 03:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony I'm
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bria arbiton from New Hampshire Lakes
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of programs there new
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
hampsh and thank you again for hearing
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony New Hampshire Lakes is a
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit for the restoration
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
and protection of New Hampshire's lakes
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and it's our first time being in front
 
03:49:12.990 --> 03:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
of you as well um we support the intent
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill to to prohibit yard waste
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
being disposed of in our state's
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
Waters and I'm not going to go over too
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
much more other than from what Rosemary
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
wrong said she gave you a pretty
 
03:49:29.149 --> 03:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive overview of everything
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
that we we also agree with
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I can take any questions if you have
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
any seeing as your um organization is
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
involved with lakes lake wide have you
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
had any anecdotal evidence of a lot of
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
this starting to happen in conjunction
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
blooms uh so can
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
you we so as an organization we
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
represent over 275 associations across
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
the state Lake Associations across the
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
state and we do know that this like
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard from our supporters that
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
this does happen people do dump or uh
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
mow grass clippings into the lake and
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
yard waste and that stuff
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
so as as far as anec anecdotal evidence
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
that algae blooms or cynobacteria blooms
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
are being uh created from yard waste I
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
think Dees would be better to give you
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of evidence thank you any
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
emercy I certainly understand the
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
educational component of this um what I
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
find difficult is the enforcement of
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
it um without the testimony or without
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
somebody actually going in and
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
testifying for law enforcement how do
 
03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
you get a conviction on
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
this that is a great question uh I think
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
like I said New Hampshire Lake supports
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and as far as how
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
the enforcement happens there uh like
 
03:51:02.590 --> 03:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
Rosemary representative run
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
said other property owners and
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
homeowners around the lake feel very
 
03:51:11.229 --> 03:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
so neighborly conversations definitely
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
help uh promote that the fostering uh of
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
Lake protection and then actual
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mean that's I'm not sure I
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
can adequately answer your
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you did you want to
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow up or you good no okay um anyone
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
else seeing no further questions thank
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank
 
03:52:00.670 --> 03:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%

ecologist a limnologist and he'll be
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
here here for any science questions that
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
may come up by the committee uh and I
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
think that like the trend of previous
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
speakers uh this is another box I get to
 
03:52:26.149 --> 03:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
check off of my house committee bingo
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
card uh being in front of Criminal
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
Justice so thank you so much uh for
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
allowing us to do this this is great so
 
03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
U I think that a lot has been said and I
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
think representative Rong uh outlined
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
the the issues
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
clearly we would maintain our position
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
at Dees is that this is already legal
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
under state law law uh that was quoted
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
before RSA 45
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
a15 but I would also agree uh with
 
03:52:52.990 --> 03:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative rung that this the
 
03:52:55.870 --> 03:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
language in that is is peculiar to I
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
think the era in which that language was
 
03:53:01.229 --> 03:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
developed and so it may not reflect uh
 
03:53:04.030 --> 03:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
the current state of affairs of uh of
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
2025 in which how people deal with their
 
03:53:09.389 --> 03:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
lawns and the uh the way that they deal
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
with stuff we do periodically get
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
complaints uh about this kind of ity at
 
03:53:18.750 --> 03:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
Dees we generally when we get a
 
03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
complaint like that and and and by far
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
the places where we find that there
 
03:53:25.389 --> 03:53:25.399 align:start position:0%
violations of water quality standards or
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
other kinds of violations of law come in
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
through complaints because we we don't
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have the staff to go to a
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
thousand lakes we have a thousand lakes
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
in the state more or less Dave will
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
correct me but um and so we don't have
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
staff to go to a thousand lakes so we do
 
03:53:41.229 --> 03:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
hear from residents and so our approach
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
is almost always to call the person
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh who you know has been witnessed doing
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
something and that could be you know
 
03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who's uh withdrawing water um
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
in a place where they shouldn't be or
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who's cleaning out their
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
Landscaping truck at a fishing game uh
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
boat put in uh that happens uh with some
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
frequency we have other things like like
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
this in which somebody is I think
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
egregiously uh taking a very large lawn
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
all the clippings and dumping them you
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
know uh in the water or other places
 
03:54:15.630 --> 03:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
nearby the water where they will reach
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
the water we get these these kind of
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
complaints a lot and almost what we what
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
we do is we call the person and go chat
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
with them because I think that generally
 
03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
speaking people are not aware and
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
they're certainly we make them aware
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that it if something's against the law
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
and that uh we also try to make them
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
aware that other people are watching uh
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
and and that certainly is the case on
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
lakes and if you have a place on a lake
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know that people are
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
watching there's probably several places
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
in state law where this kind
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
of that this is addressed in some manner
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and one of the other places is within
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
our Wetlands laws because these uh the
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
materials that maybe somebody's putting
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
in the lake has the potential to then
 
03:55:04.110 --> 03:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
settle that would actually be filling a
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
wetland so there are so that that is
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
also a component of this though somebody
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
may not realize that necessarily by
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
reading our Wetlands laws that may this
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
idea that yard waste is contributing to
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
that may not be may not be clear we also
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
have our water quality standards which
 
03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
is uh which is our which is an EnV WQ
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
1700 those are our water quality
 
03:55:28.349 --> 03:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
standards for the state they also
 
03:55:30.189 --> 03:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
indicate that you can't uh fill the
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
benthos that is you cannot Place
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
materials in that will settle and then
 
03:55:37.110 --> 03:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
fill in the bottom of a a Waterway of
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
the state so I would suggest that I
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
think this bill has some Merit the
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
concept has some Merit to clarify what
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
people can and can't do on their uh
 
03:55:50.189 --> 03:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
within the the Waters of the
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
state however I think that there
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably could be some additional work
 
03:55:56.910 --> 03:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
to find the right place in law for this
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and then to make sure that it sort of
 
03:56:01.870 --> 03:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
lines up with other sort of of the fine
 
03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
rules or fine that are established in
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
statute already for similar kinds of
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
violations so I think that there's some
 
03:56:12.389 --> 03:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
room to be able to maneuver to to
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
improve uh this um
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
Bill and with that Dave should I say
 
03:56:20.189 --> 03:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
anything else about lakes or anything
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
got all right so with that I will just
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
um see if you have any uh any questions
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what we can do so would
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
you be um amendable to working with the
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to maybe getting because
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
we would be open to an amendment that
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
put it where you thinks it it needs to
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
go um or whatever changes you think yeah
 
03:56:42.750 --> 03:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely in fact we had that
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning uh after uh a
 
03:56:47.590 --> 03:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
different bill in rr&amp;d this morning so
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
we already had that conversation okay so
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rong I'll hold on to
 
03:56:52.110 --> 03:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
this if you want to come back with an
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
amendment um we'll be willing to do that
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
um my next question is by far and a way
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
the most important what effect does Sino
 
03:57:02.590 --> 03:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
bacteria have on largemouth bass that's
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
a really good question that I'm going to
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
give to our our resident ich
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
theologist ich theologist Lake e colist
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'll do whatever um so I don't think
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a real good answer as to the
 
03:57:15.149 --> 03:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
direct effect on on large mount pass um
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
but certainly can impact your ability to
 
03:57:19.469 --> 03:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
enjoy your um you know your recreational
 
03:57:21.550 --> 03:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh fish for for large
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
amount of bass so um we've seen over the
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
past two years about 120 CYO bacteria
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
warnings that we've issued on our lakes
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
around the state of New Hampshire and
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
they've been everywhere including the
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
largest lake lake wnab basaki is 44,000
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
Acres um and it really can prevent the
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
ability for people to enjoy the
 
03:57:40.830 --> 03:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunity we don't tell
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
people they can't do certain activities
 
03:57:44.670 --> 03:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
but certainly you would would enjoy
 
03:57:46.149 --> 03:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
fishing for your large mouth bass as
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
much as you would um if the if the water
 
03:57:50.149 --> 03:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
were clear and certainly there are
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
potential uh food web impacts
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah I can uh yeah um as Ted
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned we we have over the past two
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
years um encountered and uh been able to
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
detect a new invasive species in uh Lake
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
winaki it's the spiny water
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
flea um that's probably introduced by us
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
humans but um it can promote cyob
 
03:58:20.710 --> 03:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
bacteria because it grazes on zanon so
 
03:58:22.149 --> 03:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
once you remove the zop Plankton that
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
typically Grays on the algae that are
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
there it sort of releases that food food
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
web check and provides an opportunity
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
breaks the food chain and it it can
 
03:58:33.630 --> 03:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
disrupt the food chain yes okay has the
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
have the temperatures of the Lakes been
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
um rising and at what level over the
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
last few years we have seen uh a fairly
 
03:58:44.670 --> 03:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
dramatic shift in the change in the
 
03:58:46.030 --> 03:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
temperature of the Lakes I can't tell
 
03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what that is yeah um we're
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
seeing very uh much later ice inss and
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
much earlier ice outs I know this year
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
and today in particular probably doesn't
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
seem that way to you um but but last
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
year um we documented a fairly uh
 
03:59:04.229 --> 03:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
substantial spike in the water
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
temperature in Lake basaki and if you
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
remember it re really never iced in at
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
all last year so we are seeing that um
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
across the across the state the the
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
changes in water and we do have good
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
documentation of the ice in and ice
 
03:59:18.910 --> 03:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
outdates thank you all right thank you
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
n y thank you and thank you for taking
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
my question um I so in the way that
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
you're describing um how you would
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
address a situation where uh it was
 
03:59:33.149 --> 03:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
reported that someone was putting yard
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
waste into um the surface waters so uh
 
03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
my question is or the way that you're
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
describing that is kind of reactive
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
right and so in that situation you would
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
say okay now we we understand that we're
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
going to reach out we're going to make
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
you aware um and my question is are
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
there more preventative measures what is
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
the level of kind of educating people um
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
so that they know uh that this is not
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay to do especially I can see that
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
being an issue with folks coming from
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
out ofate and just coming seasonally so
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it's a it's a
 
04:00:05.309 --> 04:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
great question and I would just point I
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
would just say that this is one of the
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
places in which we're very pleased to
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
have really excellent
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
Partners uh you know folks like New
 
04:00:16.349 --> 04:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes folks like the Lake
 
04:00:20.149 --> 04:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
sunap Association like Paka L pakway
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
Lake protective Association uh winnipauk
 
04:00:26.429 --> 04:00:26.439 align:start position:0%
Alliance I could go on and on about the
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
really uh excellent work that's going on
 
04:00:32.429 --> 04:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
by both volunteers and professionals to
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
do that sort of thing we try very hard
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
to do public Outreach with the tools
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
that we have uh available to us but I
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
would just say that that's really the
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of having great Partners is so
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
that people can understand we I think
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
you heard from New Hampshire lakes that
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
they have 275 different Lake
 
04:00:56.030 --> 04:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
Associations that they're in pretty
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
constant contact with um they also have
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
a very large list of people in New
 
04:01:03.990 --> 04:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they send out stuff to I
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
know I get their stuff uh several times
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
a week I think so they're very on top of
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
doing that kind of activity and they
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
have and and other people have
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
other other other groups have specific
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach that they do to Lake owners in
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
particular um one thing that I would
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
highlight from New Hampshire Lakes is
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
their lak smart program which works
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
directly with Lakefront water o uh
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
Waterfront owners to actually go through
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
and do an assessment of their property
 
04:01:35.070 --> 04:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
to identify the pollution sources and
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
what they can do about it we've done
 
04:01:39.149 --> 04:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
some of that uh with our soak up the
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
rain program where we've helped
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
communities and organizations to create
 
04:01:45.149 --> 04:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
rain Gardens uh which are a way of
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
controlling storm water I guess just a
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
word on pollution in general while I I
 
04:01:52.590 --> 04:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
have your attention for a moment is that
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire generally has excellent
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
water quality and we are very blessed by
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
that when you look at compared New
 
04:02:00.750 --> 04:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waters to other places in in
 
04:02:02.189 --> 04:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
the United States and the world we have
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
really good water quality except where
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
we don't and where we don't it is almost
 
04:02:10.149 --> 04:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
always a problem of storm water that is
 
04:02:11.790 --> 04:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
Storm water's bringing stuff in whether
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's lawn waste or it's or it's
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
fertilizers or it's other things that
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
have been put on the on the ground that
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
is by and large the biggest issue facing
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
our our our Waters today and so I just
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
want to just make that note as you think
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
about uh when this issue comes up about
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know lakes and cyanobacteria it
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
really comes back to those
 
04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
issues representative Murphy thank you
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I have both a comment and a
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
question um I serve on a on a commission
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
the environmentally triggered uh chronic
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
illness here and um one of the issues
 
04:02:50.830 --> 04:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
and this is to um representative Roy's
 
04:02:54.910 --> 04:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
points about um fish one of the other um
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have are the health
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
impacts known to be Associated um
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
Associated at this point with um
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
exposure to cyanobacteria and Dr STL at
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um is done a lot of research
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
into the association with ALS um in
 
04:03:12.990 --> 04:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
people uh living near I think it was
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
maybe it was Moma Lake was it um so
 
04:03:17.790 --> 04:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
there are certainly you know research
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
takes a while and um I think our our the
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
concern is always Public Health as well
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
as you know Lake life and Etc um and in
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
addition I I um I appreciate the
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you made to maybe
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
consider this also for um in relation to
 
04:03:37.469 --> 04:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
other statute but is there a reason why
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
it would not be appropriate in the Clean
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
Lake I I think it's just the the
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
challenge there is that it's it's a
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
little bit out of place um most of our
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement capabilities occur in other
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
statutes namely
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
485a and the way that it's put in is
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit confusing so I think
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
that it can be spruced up and where this
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
ends up in state in state law is one of
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
those things that we should probably
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
talk through follow up thank you um what
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
the there's another list of the things
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
that are precluded how is that be
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
different how would the the yard debris
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
be different than
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
trees yes thank you for the two
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
different statutes okay um the the
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
statute that this is put into is largely
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
pertains at this point it's the clean
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
Lakes program which is makes sense why
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
this would go there don't don't get me
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
wrong but that largely pertains to
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
invasive uh species going into the water
 
04:04:42.429 --> 04:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
so this is the mil foil issue and so
 
04:04:45.389 --> 04:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's largely where has stood it also
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
does have some of the cyanobacteria
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
pieces so I think it requires some
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
consideration about the best place in
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
state law for it not that it wouldn't
 
04:04:54.910 --> 04:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
that that this would be horrible If This
 
04:04:57.149 --> 04:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
Were to passed today it's not going to
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know cause mass chaos but it it
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
could be better placed to be able to be
 
04:05:02.840 --> 04:05:04.229 align:start position:0%
could be better placed to be able to be
more

04:05:04.229 --> 04:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
effective okay so there'll be no harm to
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
putting it in that I don't think there's
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
a harm it's just I I just think it it
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't line up terrifically with the
 
04:05:15.870 --> 04:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
rest of what we do okay thank thank you
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
sure representative L
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
cell thank you for taking my question
 
04:05:24.030 --> 04:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to enforcement does uh
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game have any uh enforcement uh
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
capability or responsibility with this
 
04:05:32.149 --> 04:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
sort of thing thank you for your
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is that they
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
I've not ever seen that um they would
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
probably bring something to our
 
04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
attention to to then apply our statutes
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
under unless it was direct ly affecting
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a fish or
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
Wildlife perhaps but I I don't know the
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
answer to that question my experience is
 
04:05:52.990 --> 04:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
that these kinds of things are normally
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
04:05:58.030 --> 04:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
us followup follow up it would just seem
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
to me that fishion game has a a presence
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
on the Lakes they could possibly witness
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
someone doing this and just as an
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
education component tell them that hey
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be doing that that sort
 
04:06:15.550 --> 04:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
of thing yeah I thank you for the
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question I think one one piece
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
of this piece of legislation is it does
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
allow for any peace officer okay to be
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
able to do this I imagine that that
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
would have inrud Marine Patrol maybe
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
cosos I don't know how that's all
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
designated in state law but one of the
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
things I just point out about the par
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
this particular law is that it does then
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
allow for M
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities to then have some ability
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to um to do something about
 
04:06:46.110 --> 04:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
this issue should they find out about it
 
04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
that seemed like a good part of the bill
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
like that seems like an interesting
 
04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
thing to me because again mun
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities are much more aware of
 
04:06:55.710 --> 04:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their own communities
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they're as likely as Dees to get a
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
complaint I think um the
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative's point is well taken
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
though an interface with Fish and Game
 
04:07:08.189 --> 04:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
actually as a force multiplier because
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
they in turn have tens of thousands of
 
04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
Anglers and Sportsmen and Sports women
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
who are out there in the water who are
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
seeing things and are reporting and can
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
come back and help so I think there's a
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
partnership to be had yeah we can always
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
chat with them absolutely okay any
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative U
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
Muse also noting that under uh uh 487 um
 
04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things we actually do have in
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
place is a section on enforcement
 
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh for disposal of sewage
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
from boats right uh and uh if you think
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
about it I mean this is not quite the
 
04:07:48.910 --> 04:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
same thing but it's very similar uh um
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is could that be
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know provide some guidance in
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
terms of how we go about enforcing this
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much for the
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
question and I think you're right I
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
think we would look at all those things
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
if we were gonna you know take another
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
look at this great thank
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
you representative um sour d Shire
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
sh the new species of the invasive
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
species of flea does that have any
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
natural predators that could be
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question the
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
question was are there any predators of
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
the spining waterflea yes that that
 
04:08:22.269 --> 04:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
could be follow um none that none that
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're aware of uh fish will occasionally
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
eat them they're uh a very crunchy
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
morsel to eat so they tend to prefer
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
other things okay and uh followup
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
followup follow um the this bill
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
presents a punitive measure is there a
 
04:08:42.790 --> 04:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
scientific solution based off of
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
chemistry that to be used to solve the
 
04:08:48.910 --> 04:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
blooms there's no chemical solution to
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the amount of nutrients going
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
into our water bodies now thank
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
you where do these fleas come
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
from great question um they uh are in
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
Lake Champlain so you know there's a
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
good chance that they came one of the
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
larger water bodies Great Lakes Lake
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%

trafficker this is this anti-trafficking
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
measure and if you think there is no
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
trafficking in New Hampshire let me uh
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
read from several documents for you you
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh this is from the New Hampshire
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
Violence we know that human labor and
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking is a growing problem in
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
this country and New Hampshire is not
 
04:17:57.870 --> 04:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
immune increasing awareness of these
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
crimes result in more positive
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
identification of human trafficking and
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has seen an increasing
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
number of human trafficking cases in
 
04:18:06.080 --> 04:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
number of human trafficking cases in

04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise be guilty of the crime of
 
04:26:27.389 --> 04:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
statutory rape by going to have this
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
procedure he'd thus be taking care of
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence that would lead to his
 
04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
conviction that that is true yes yes
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:26:38.189 --> 04:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
04:26:38.199 --> 04:26:40.550 align:start position:0%
representative um
Sher

04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
Sher
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
um let me divied you've identified this
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
bill uh as a sex trafficking Bill uh
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
those words don't appear in this bills
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned about the breadth of
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
the bill um so let me divide it into two
 
04:26:57.520 --> 04:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
the bill um so let me divide it into two
groups

04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are engaged in sex
 
04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
trafficking and take a minor for an
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
abortion second group is everybody else
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
who takes a minor for an abortion for
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
for example uh 18-year-old boyfriend
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
takes his 17-year-old girlfriend for an
 
04:27:21.149 --> 04:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
abortion do you intend this bill to
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
apply to that second
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
group um any adult a non-minor an
 
04:27:32.189 --> 04:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
18-year-old who takes a 17-year-old
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
girlfriend without to answer the
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
question please go ahead without without
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
parental permission yes
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes um follow up
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm sorry um do you have any
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
data that establishes that that second
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
kind of in the people that that event uh
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
described in the second group that's
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually happening in New Hampshire um
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
well as you probably know New Hampshire
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
is one of three states in the nation
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
that does not capture abortion
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
statistics do you have any anecdotal
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
information that that is happening
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh I have no personal I have no personal
 
04:28:15.239 --> 04:28:16.830 align:start position:0%
uh I have no personal I have no personal
antidotal

04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
antidotal
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
data um did you not um at the beginning
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
of your testimony cite some evidence
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
that you had that it was occurring in
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with um regard to the sex
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
trafficking um based on the uh articles
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth that I read yes from the
 
04:28:35.710 --> 04:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
Coalition and all yes so further
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
followup um followup um Ju Just for for
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
from a based on the chair's question I
 
04:28:44.109 --> 04:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
was referring to that second group
 
04:28:50.429 --> 04:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:50.439 --> 04:28:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
what what does recruiting
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
mean um recruiting was an error in um
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment that wasn't should have
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
been struck when drafted um and I will
 
04:29:09.469 --> 04:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
get that correction
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
made and last followup uh what does
 
04:29:12.960 --> 04:29:14.790 align:start position:0%
made and last followup uh what does
harboring

04:29:14.790 --> 04:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
harboring
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
mean um
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh harboring um I think would mean um uh
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
having um um not possession but uh um in
 
04:29:33.109 --> 04:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:29:36.790 --> 04:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm searching for the word um but
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
um with the uh young lady maybe having
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
her an apartment could even be a
 
04:29:43.119 --> 04:29:45.030 align:start position:0%
her an apartment could even be a
kidnapping

04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
kidnapping
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
answers representative
 
04:29:53.710 --> 04:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:29:58.349 --> 04:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in looking at um
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and then also who has a right
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
of action a right of civil action
 
04:30:05.229 --> 04:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
afterwards so it says that um what would
 
04:30:07.550 --> 04:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
be required as far as parental consent
 
04:30:09.630 --> 04:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
would be written and notorized
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
so if uh are you concerned ConEd and
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
then it says that of course you know um
 
04:30:16.590 --> 04:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
people who would have right to civil
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
action included in that would be the
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
biological father of the en board Tri so
 
04:30:22.349 --> 04:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
my my question is are you concerned
 
04:30:26.109 --> 04:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
about um if there was consent given um
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
yet they didn't happen to get written
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
notorized consent that the biological
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
father that this could be used
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
maliciously in a situation where there
 
04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
were issues between the um the
 
04:30:42.750 --> 04:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
parents of the the biological father is
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
on line 17 and 18 um uh could not bring
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
a civil action if the pregnancy is
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
resulted from his action okay I Y I
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
understand that okay I'm sorry can I
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
follow I'm sorry
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
have let me let me just make it clear
 
04:31:03.870 --> 04:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm I probably didn't do that
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
very well um so the requirement for
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
there to be parental consent yes would
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
be written and notorized consent yes
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
consent right correct um and then of the
 
04:31:21.070 --> 04:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
people who have right to take civil
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
action the biological father can be
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
right so if there is a situation in
 
04:31:29.790 --> 04:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
which the parents did give consent they
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen to for example get it
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
notorized there's a there's written
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
consent but they didn't they couldn't
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
find a notary right in time um are you
 
04:31:40.109 --> 04:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
at all concerned that it could be used
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
this could be used maliciously by a
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
biological father if there were a
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
situation where you know they had a
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
falling out the father you know wasn't
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
happy about the situation they could
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
essentially use what is a technicality
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
created by this law maliciously against
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
the mother are you concerned about that
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
I I think that um if it's a matter of
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
having um uh written uh consent but not
 
04:32:09.070 --> 04:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
notorized I think the courts would uh
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I would think that if the
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
parents U maintain their consent um and
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that it wasn't notorized would
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
only come into play if they were
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
actually caught during the ACT
 
04:32:27.550 --> 04:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards would it not be the case that
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
the parents would come to court and say
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
no we did consent to this thus stopping
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
that case
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
possibly further
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you chairman Roy um and
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure um
 
04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
I guess just in response to or curious
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
about this last part would you object to
 
04:32:52.750 --> 04:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
the notorized part being removed because
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
I I do think that places a significant
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
barrier you know it can be hard for
 
04:32:59.309 --> 04:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
people to get to notary pay for a notary
 
04:33:02.429 --> 04:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
Etc it's um it's really your bill at
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
this point um I just going to make the
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh recruitment uh correction and uh then
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
yours so I take it to mean you're
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
neutral on that
 
04:33:15.869 --> 04:33:15.879 align:start position:0%
uh yeah probably so I I think that there
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
are other states that um have also
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
required notorized um but I have not
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
looked for all the legislation in other
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
states so I'm not sure what is required
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I just wanted to take your
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
temperature as we discuss this later in
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
executive what we think would be
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendable um further do you have a
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
followup okay so you no further
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for oh once again
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
represent me that's okay it's
 
04:33:41.240 --> 04:33:44.429 align:start position:0%
represent me that's okay it's
representative

04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
fault who would actually be in charge of
 
04:33:50.109 --> 04:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
bill um uh the justice system um the uh
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
police um you know this could be a
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
04:34:03.551 --> 04:34:03.561 align:start position:0%
so so somebody could make a complaint to
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
a police
 
04:34:08.029 --> 04:34:08.039 align:start position:0%
officer I would expect that's the case
 
04:34:12.029 --> 04:34:12.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:34:12.039 --> 04:34:15.429 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
represent

04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
PR so if the pregnant 17-year-old girl
 
04:34:21.789 --> 04:34:21.799 align:start position:0%
decides to get in a car and drive
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
somewhere across state
 
04:34:26.910 --> 04:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
lines what happens then because I keep
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
hearing about if somebody's taking her
 
04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
herself um that would not fall under
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
this if she goes by herself this would
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
be accompanied by an adult who takes her
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
yes see no further questions thank you
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much at this time the
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee I'm here
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
today with you and opposition to HB 191
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
as amended because for many reasons I
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's unenforceable
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and potentially invi
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
politically unviable first if I passed
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
if passed HB
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
191 would permit an unprecedented
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
climate of Big Brother government
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance into everyday Granite
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
Staters lives with real questions about
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
how law enforcement would be carried out
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis under this
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
law are there going to be random teen
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
pregnancy testings or roadside stops are
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
there going to be random inspections of
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities this surveillance
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
of which young people are pregnant and
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
who assists them in obtaining access to
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
what is currently a legal healthc care
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
procedure will pit neighbors against
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
neighbors parents against Healthcare
 
04:36:02.830 --> 04:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
Providers and family members against
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
each other second if past HB 191 would
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
permit an unconstitutional invasion of
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
privacy into young people's lives here
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as they exercise their
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
right to travel the right to bodily
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
autonomy the right to live their lives
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
free from government intrusion solely
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
based on their sex and their
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
reproductive status under current laws
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
miners can access safe and legal
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
abortion and have the freedom to travel
 
04:36:31.390 --> 04:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
to healthcare appointments but miners
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
need only notify their parents when they
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
receive an abortion but under HB 191 as
 
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
amended minors would now need consent
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
from their parents prior to receiving an
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
abortion this law shifts the power of a
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
young person to decide their own
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
reproductive fate to power of a parent
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
who may not have the child's best
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
interest in mind this is a dangerous
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
shift of control and the proposed law
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
does not adequately address the Myriad
 
04:36:58.510 --> 04:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
cases where this law will invade the
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
privacy of people here in the granite
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
state so just imagine a middle schooler
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
and I should just apologize in advance
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
for this scenario imagine a middle
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
schooler being impregnated by a father
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
who then refuses to consent to a
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy test or an abortion given his
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
potential criminal exposure then imagine
 
04:37:20.429 --> 04:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
that father then presses charges under
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
the law against the trusted person her
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
mother who drove this young person not
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
old enough yet to drive to receive their
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
abortion and protect them from an
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
unwanted child born out of incest
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
imagine that father also names the man
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
who works at the intake desk at the
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider's office and the
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider at the medical
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
facility who helps the mother with her
 
04:37:42.429 --> 04:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
young child
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
nothing in this law prevents this
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
tragedy from unfolding and there are no
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
exceptions for interf family
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
disagreements or incest hb11 as amended
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
is statuto statutory cruelty UNF which
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
is unfair and discriminates against
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
women as a class to be clear there is no
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
equivalent privacy Invasion for males
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire for their
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and for a state that Prides
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
itself on living free of government
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
intrusion there is nothing free about HB
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
199 191 as
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
amended third if ped HB 191 as amended
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
will be politically damaging given the
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
governor's public statements that she
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
will veto any further restrictions of
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
abortion law in this state the potential
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
exercise of voting for 191 as amended as
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
OTP will pit supporters of this bill
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
against our newly elected governor as
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
you may recall governor aat recently um
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
campaigned on the promise that abortion
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
law here in New Hampshire was settled
 
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
and it would go un changed while she's
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
here in the executive office a vote for
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
191 as amended will reveal a true
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
internal party disagreement that the
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
Senate will surely not appreciate having
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
to debate and determine on the public
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
record and at last please consider that
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of granite Staters are
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
against the restrictions on abortion as
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
proposed so passage of this bill will
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
damage the likelihood for future
 
04:39:06.910 --> 04:39:06.920 align:start position:0%

easy New Hampshire has a sex trafficking
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%

in 23 64 victims in 2022 and 75 in
 
04:41:34.590 --> 04:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
21 and as you heard from representative
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh as a far as as as as recent
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
as 2022 DCF identified 95 reports of the
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking of minors of which 98% were
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking and of course these are
 
04:41:49.868 --> 04:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
underestimates there you know many
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
things go unreported many things go
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
uncaught I want to I want to also talk
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
about an example that recently happened
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that's been
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
documented uh reading from an nhpr
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
article Jane Doe's law civil lawsuit
 
04:42:06.750 --> 04:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
alleges that Gage at the whitec raped
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
her on a nearly a near weekly basis over
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the course of several years o was in
 
04:42:14.110 --> 04:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
state custody between 2001 and 2005
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
according to her civil suit she also
 
04:42:17.788 --> 04:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
claims in her civil suit that she became
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
pregnant as the as result of the rapes
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that Gage then coerced her into
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
having an abortion this happened right
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire under State
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
protection the fact is we have sex
 
04:42:32.830 --> 04:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking and we have abuse we need an
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
adult involved who has the child's
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
interests at heart whether that's a
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
parent or a
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
judge in terms of the constitutionality
 
04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's recommendation
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
that of removing the word recruit would
 
04:42:46.470 --> 04:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
address the issues that have been
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
brought up in federal court that is the
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
primary reason that the Idaho bill was
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
injuncted by district court and the
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
ninth Circuit of appeals just reinstated
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
the the rest of that bill and in
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
December the ninth circuit based in San
 
04:43:00.868 --> 04:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
Francisco is not known for being a
 
04:43:00.878 --> 04:43:04.270 align:start position:0%
Francisco is not known for being a
conservative

04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
Bastion I I'll also mention that the
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
statute only require requires that the
 
04:43:10.590 --> 04:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
behavior be within the state of New
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so in terms of interstate
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
commerce it only affects behavior that
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
was here you've heard the bill called
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the travel ban or you will in a sense it
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
is it bans abusers sex traffickers ande
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
and predators from traveling to get rid
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the evidence of their crime against a
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
minor girl with an abortion I'm okay
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
with that there will be many cases where
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
securing a conviction on the other
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
aspects of sex trafficking or abuse will
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
be difficult this bill would protect
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
girls from their
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
abusers if you want to address the very
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
real problem of sex trafficking in New
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you to vote OTP on hb11
 
04:43:49.520 --> 04:43:51.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you to vote OTP on hb11
thank

04:43:51.310 --> 04:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you I just I think I have a
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
couple of questions because I want to
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
clarify some things um about what this
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill does or does not do the bill does
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
not make it illegal for a minor uh to
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
get an abortion is that correct that's
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
correct representative if if a minor
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
female wanted to get an abortion
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
currently to stated the law is she could
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
obtain one after parental notification
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct so what
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it penalizes an adult
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
who pressures or somehow coerces that
 
04:44:30.110 --> 04:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
child to get an abortion that he did not
 
04:44:30.120 --> 04:44:31.750 align:start position:0%
child to get an abortion that he did not
otherwise

04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:44:34.030 --> 04:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
want can you clarify that last part
 
04:44:35.708 --> 04:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
please well in other words if the child
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
didn't start out wanting an abortion she
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep the child the term and
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
this perpetrator came into the scene and
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
convinced or coerced that child that's
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
when this law would take effect is that
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
who this law is targeting in other words
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty against the child
 
04:44:52.270 --> 04:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty against the the
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
abortion provider it's solely the adult
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
involved in convincing that child to get
 
04:45:00.430 --> 04:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
the abortion and taking them there thank
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative my
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's not the convincing
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
part it's the assisting part so it's
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's the traveling and um the obtaining
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
part so simply talking to her I in my
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill would not
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.110 --> 04:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay so if a child wanted to get an
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
abortion say a
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
16-year-old and she told her parents but
 
04:45:28.150 --> 04:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't get any kind of written
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
notification or something and she took
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
an Uber and went and got one there's no
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
issue but if she had an adult driver
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
that adult would then be subject to this
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the statute
 
04:45:41.708 --> 04:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative is that it's only if they
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
do it knowingly so if they're if
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
somebody just asked for a ride and they
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what for I I would imagine
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be knowingly thank you
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
further question our representative um
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you Mr chair um I I have to
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
admit I have a I'll try to be brief but
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
I have a number of questions there's
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
nothing about pressuring or coercing in
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
this bill correct that's my
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
understanding representative um and so
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
the 18-year-old boyfriend of the
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
17-year-old minor uh who takes her to
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
get an abortion because neither of them
 
04:46:17.470 --> 04:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
want the parents to know and they have
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
no idea in the world how to do the
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
judicial bypass process that boy could
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
one be convicted of a misdemeanor right
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and that boy
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
could be sued by the parents is that
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
right and that is my understanding um
 
04:46:36.430 --> 04:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
now right to life is an abortion
 
04:46:38.430 --> 04:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
organization isn't it uh we're much
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
bigger than just abortion we we want to
 
04:46:43.628 --> 04:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
protect women and children okay but uh
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
you were here when I asked I'm sorry I
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
keep forgetting to ask for followup yeah
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
that that and um stick to the questions
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
about the bill not the organization
 
04:46:51.600 --> 04:46:54.910 align:start position:0%
about the bill not the organization
please

04:46:54.910 --> 04:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
um you um I'm looking at my notes you
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
said there uh there's uh data that says
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
that there were 50 to 75 victims of Seft
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking in New Hampshire right
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
uh that's that was what was known by one
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
report and what number of those 51 to 75
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
victims uh were
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
minors um my I let me double
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
check he said 91% I don't know if I have
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
down I'm not sure if I have that so a
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
subset of the 51 to 75 um of that subset
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
of miners uh how many uh were
 
04:47:40.990 --> 04:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
transported by someone or harbored by
 
04:47:44.110 --> 04:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
someone to in order to conceal an
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
abortion well because we don't keep uh
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
statistics representative we don't know
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't know if we're this is a
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh a solution in search of a problem
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
or whether it's actually a a real
 
04:47:59.948 --> 04:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire uh
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%

about any other questions yeah one more
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh this is going to be a
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
cross-examination just all right I'll
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
stop now only to elucidate the committee
 
04:48:21.070 --> 04:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
no the thing that confuses me about the
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that I've heard is that we've
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
heard over and over and over and over
 
04:48:32.350 --> 04:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
again about this trafficking and the
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
trafficking problem and trafficking
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
adults but trying to get people that are
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
try doing this hobing and recruiting and
 
04:48:39.600 --> 04:48:41.110 align:start position:0%
try doing this hobing and recruiting and
transporting

04:48:41.110 --> 04:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
transporting
 
04:48:44.110 --> 04:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
there's not one mention of tra of of
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking in here so maybe we could
 
04:48:49.230 --> 04:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
make some kind of amendment that says
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
for people who traffic represent minor
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
may I interrupt you and ask you look at
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill you could you read that for
 
04:49:11.708 --> 04:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay then I I'll I'll amend the way my
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
question there is one word in there
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
about trafficking and now that
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
trafficking is in there is that only and
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the reason I didn't find it on line
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
three is I haven't had this amend in
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
very long oh may I have a followup
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
oration of question also line five as
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
well go ahead thank
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
you okay also line
 
04:49:33.080 --> 04:49:35.830 align:start position:0%
you okay also line
five

04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
traffing so the law is trafficking of a
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.070 --> 04:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
but it applies to any adult any adult
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're trafficking or not is
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
that correct any adult who does not have
 
04:49:51.390 --> 04:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
the pr the parents permission so with so
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
without the par followup follow up go
 
04:49:55.990 --> 04:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
ahead so without the parents
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
permission then any adult male becomes a
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
trafficker by not getting the parents
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
permission I'm I'm I'm having a really
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time with that is that correct
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I I would look at the lengthy list of
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions because there are many many
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
people who are accepted from that well
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
also I'll just I'll just I'll just leave
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
it at that thank you does it apply only
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
to men a woman could be charged as well
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
correct yeah okay thank you I'm
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative pro thank you
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
so I had a
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
little trouble with clarifying your your
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:39.310 --> 04:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
about uh a girl who was forced into
 
04:50:39.320 --> 04:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
about uh a girl who was forced into
prostitution

04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
prostitution
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you're worried about her parents not
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that she crossed state lines to
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
get an
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
abortion does her parents know that
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
she's in
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
prostitution uh so so if I understand
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
your question correctly representative
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're asking um do her parents know
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
that she was doing in
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
prostitution right because that's the
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
example you gave us right a girl forc
 
04:51:06.638 --> 04:51:09.150 align:start position:0%
example you gave us right a girl forc
prostitution

04:51:09.150 --> 04:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
prostitution
 
04:51:11.590 --> 04:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
and you're wor worried about some guy
 
04:51:13.390 --> 04:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
driving our across state lines to get an
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
abortion how about stopping the
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
prostitution so uh to address done if I
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
may Mr chair if I may address um the
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
first part of that it the bill does not
 
04:51:25.230 --> 04:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
talk about state lines at all it says if
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
the behavior happens within New
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's nothing about state
 
04:51:31.548 --> 04:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
lines um the second part is that in that
 
04:51:32.948 --> 04:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
particular story which I'm happy to send
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
you uh she ran away from home and so the
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
real goal is to get a parent involved um
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
get some sort of responsible adult when
 
04:51:43.548 --> 04:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
when things are going wrong and whether
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's a judge through judicial Bypass
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
or whether it's a parent um that that's
 
04:51:47.440 --> 04:51:48.990 align:start position:0%
or whether it's a parent um that that's
the

04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
goal I have a a question it occurs to me
 
04:51:55.628 --> 04:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
why are we focused on on on the the
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
medical procedure of abortion why is it
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
not frankly any adult taking a minor to
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
get a medical procedure without
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
permission of the parents is problematic
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
in my be why is it just we focused on
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
this and why does it say any adult
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
taking a minor for medical procedure
 
04:52:14.430 --> 04:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
without their parents permission or
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge is a
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
crime well I would say that thank you
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I I
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
would say that abortion is distinct
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
because from other medical procedures
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
because in other medical procedures a
 
04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
person is not a person's life is not
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
intentionally ended true and and
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
abortion is actually used I mean I I I
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
cited that statistic earlier where I
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
think among 66 trafficking victims uh
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
there were 114 abortions so particularly
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
in sex trafficking abortion is used to
 
04:52:44.910 --> 04:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
cover up the crime I I asked because
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's it's not the only I mean we have
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
cases of people who are who are being um
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
having gender reassignment surgeries a
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
lot of things that young people are
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
having done now that are medical that
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
parents in my mind should be at least
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
notified if they're responsible and safe
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
parents so I'm curious if if why we're
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
why we're just eliminating it to one
 
04:53:06.360 --> 04:53:07.390 align:start position:0%
why we're just eliminating it to one
that's

04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
all um any further questions represent
 
04:53:10.718 --> 04:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
all um any further questions represent
of

04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
new actually I think I think let me just
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
so sex sex trafficking is illegal
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
currently right that's my understanding
 
04:53:29.948 --> 04:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
um if you were to uh Force someone to
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
I guess it's it depends on how you
 
04:53:50.190 --> 04:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
Define coercion force
 
04:53:53.788 --> 04:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
uh sorry I don't know what I did there
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
um but my point is that we're focusing
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
on sex trafficking and I can understand
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
that that things happen in that
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
situation that um a lot of things happen
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
in that situation that are are unsavory
 
04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the point is is that that's already
 
04:54:08.910 --> 04:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
illegal and so this conflating um
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
conflating these things just seems
 
04:54:13.708 --> 04:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
off to me because that's not really what
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
we're doing here and correct me if I'm
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
wrong but what we're doing here I think
 
04:54:20.350 --> 04:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
is we are adding to the definition of
 
04:54:22.590 --> 04:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
trafficking and now saying this also
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
qualifies as trafficking so it's
 
04:54:29.708 --> 04:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
it's it seems a little disingenuous to
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
me to be talking about sex trafficking
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the same and making it seem as if
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is doing do you
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
see it differently thank you for the
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
question representative I think I would
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
see would see it differently because
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's a there are a lot of crimes
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
which are difficult to secure a
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
conviction for but if we have something
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's con so sex trafficking may may be
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
one of those crimes so if we have
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
something concrete that we can say well
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
this this Behavior was criminal then it
 
04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity as a society to
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
protect that protect that minor thank
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
you representative um um
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
Sher um I'll be uncharacteristically pre
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware of HB 231 filed by
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative Perez that prohibits
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
School District Personnel from
 
04:55:20.708 --> 04:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
transporting students to medical
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
procedures without parental consent I'm
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
not representative um might that be a
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
better vehicle for uh accomplishing uh a
 
04:55:36.548 --> 04:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
good bit of what uh um uh chair uh Roy
 
04:55:36.558 --> 04:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
good bit of what uh um uh chair uh Roy
was

04:55:37.830 --> 04:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting uh well having not seen the
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
the bill uh what I would say is that it
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
sounds like it only covers School
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
personnel and if there's other people
 
04:55:47.708 --> 04:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
that are trafficking minors then we want
 
04:55:49.868 --> 04:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have we have a
 
04:55:53.470 --> 04:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
crime for them um might it be a better
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle in that it could be amended to
 
04:55:57.868 --> 04:55:57.878 align:start position:0%
be broader than just School Personnel I
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the legislation
 
04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr tar thank you for taking
 
04:56:11.230 --> 04:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
my question um I guess just
 
04:56:13.590 --> 04:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
a basic um lack of understanding I have
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
for the need for this bill is it's
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
already you know parental notification
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
is already in law and there's already
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor attached to failure to
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
notify the parents
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm just having a hard time even
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
imagining a scenario where an individual
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
is driving a minor to an appointment to
 
04:56:35.788 --> 04:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
get an
 
04:56:38.350 --> 04:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
abortion without the parental consent
 
04:56:39.628 --> 04:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
cuz that that or the parental
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
notification because that's already
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
required by law so it's almost like to
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
me this is this almost opens up like
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the minor has the parental
 
04:56:53.190 --> 04:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
notification to get the abortion but
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
then now they need to randomly get this
 
04:56:57.548 --> 04:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
written notorized consent for the drive
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the abort do you know what I mean
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
like it just kind of like I don't
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
understand I guess the necessity for it
 
04:57:05.470 --> 04:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
because we're already have safeguards in
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
place to prevent abortions happening
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
without parental notification or
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
judicial bypass
 
04:57:11.670 --> 04:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:57:14.070 --> 04:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative one of the behaviors that
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
is covered under the amendment is my
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's also
 
04:57:19.948 --> 04:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
obtaining the abortion pills and giving
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
them to her so you can go online right
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
now and Order abortion pills and it asks
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
you a couple questions which for which
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's no verification and they'll
 
04:57:32.310 --> 04:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
they'll mail them to you and so I
 
04:57:34.548 --> 04:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is needed in the
 
04:57:36.990 --> 04:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
era of of abortion pills being so
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
readily available and not NE and not
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily just having abortions at a
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
at a center could not a a minor order
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
them themselves they could and under
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
this bill they would be Exempted okay
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
represent Murray you had to follow
 
04:57:54.190 --> 04:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
up um I see
 
04:57:56.910 --> 04:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
you uh well first of all to my
 
04:57:58.628 --> 04:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
understanding you know anyone who who is
 
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
getting abortion pills online is to have
 
04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
a teleah health appointment with a
 
04:58:04.830 --> 04:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
medical provider online but I guess with
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
what you're saying does that mean then
 
04:58:09.470 --> 04:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
the out of state provider potentially
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
would then be
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
liable under this statute for providing
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
the abortion
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
pills the my understanding is that the
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
bill at the top says within the state
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
you in addition to the human trafficking
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
situation that you've outlined um a
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
comment on this uh 17-year-old girl has
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
a 19-year-old sister uh there's a
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
history of abuse in the family they're
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
both afraid of what the parents or maybe
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
one of the parents uh will do if the
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
younger girl if girl basically goes to
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
them and tells her that she's pregnant
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
and she wants to have an abortion the
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
19-year-old sister uh could get the
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
chemical drug uh and provide it to her
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
sister she could drive her sister to an
 
04:59:08.590 --> 04:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
abortion would the sister basically as
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
as I read the bill as it as it's
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposed now uh that 19-year-old sister
 
04:59:16.548 --> 04:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
would be just as guilty of an offense as
 
04:59:19.830 --> 04:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
the human trafficker is that true so my
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of the intent of the bill
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that there's a
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
responsible adult involved in this
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
situation and if the parents really are
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
that abusive that then having a Judicial
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
bypass would probably be beneficial
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
because then you'd have somebody else
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
looking into it to make sure she's okay
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
followup follow that may be the intent
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I don't see that in the
 
04:59:39.120 --> 04:59:41.230 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I don't see that in the
bill

04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:59:43.150 --> 04:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative if you look at
 
04:59:44.830 --> 04:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
the list of exceptions the parental
 
04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
notification in the amendment is there
 
04:59:48.830 --> 04:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
so if there if there is a parental
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
notification judicial bypass then the uh
 
04:59:54.910 --> 04:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
then it's
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
allowed um i' I've got a final question
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
and I asked this of the of the
 
05:00:02.350 --> 05:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative as well in in my mind
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
when I read this I I was also confused
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
about you know the need why and in my
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
mind someone guilty of statutory rape
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
would want to destroy the evidence for
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term and would indeed
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
coer or perhaps force a minor to to go
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
and get an abortion to absolve
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
themselves of that crime would this
 
05:00:25.230 --> 05:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
cover that my understanding is that it
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
would representative also the the right
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
the the the YDC case that's that's in
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
the in the papers is example and that's
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
not even statute that's not statut
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's real rape and it was covered up
 
05:00:37.948 --> 05:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
with abortion thank you um see no
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you for your
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
Eliason hello committee thank you for
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%

05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
rights it would be really nice if this
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
bill was about sex trafficking wouldn't
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
that be nice finally in the granite
 
05:01:39.670 --> 05:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
state we're doing something about it but
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill is about and
 
05:01:44.430 --> 05:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
you all know it you have been asking
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
these questions that are needed that are
 
05:01:50.430 --> 05:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
wanted and that are Urgent to our
 
05:01:53.708 --> 05:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
community this bill is purely about
 
05:01:56.670 --> 05:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
controlling children's bodies I'm going
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
to say that again this bill is about
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
controlling children's bodies girls
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
bodies it is a slippery
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
slope Nazi Germany didn't start with
 
05:02:10.830 --> 05:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
concentration camp it actually started
 
05:02:10.840 --> 05:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
concentration camp it actually started
in

05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
1933 when the Nazis actually destroyed
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
the institute for sexual science not
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.470 --> 05:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
anymore there are six women on this
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee out of 15
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
seats sit with
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
that you are going to decide an entire
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
State's rights for women this will not
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
stop with girls the white supremacist
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
threat in New Hampshire is as big as as
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's ever been there are 16 active hate
 
05:02:49.470 --> 05:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
groups in a state of 1.1 million
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
people we have a state motto that is
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die but with this bill it
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
die again this is a very slippery slope
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
and this is not one that New Hampshire
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
wants to travel
 
05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
down I grew up right behind t Jacob in a
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
very Interfaith Community I have Jewish
 
05:03:15.868 --> 05:03:15.878 align:start position:0%

Christian
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
friends and this is not what many people
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
holy you should not legislate people's
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
bodies if this is what if sex
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
trafficking is really a big issue which
 
05:03:33.070 --> 05:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
I know it is we all know it
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
is make it a sex trafficking
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill I went through conquered High
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I know many many girls who went
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
pregnant in high
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
school that's what this bill does is
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
enforce allow that to become more
 
05:03:55.830 --> 05:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
frequent not only does it trap girls in
 
05:03:55.840 --> 05:03:56.990 align:start position:0%
frequent not only does it trap girls in
their

05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
hometowns but it makes it harder for
 
05:04:00.480 --> 05:04:03.628 align:start position:0%
hometowns but it makes it harder for
families

05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
overall this decision is between the
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
child their parents and and their
 
05:04:14.190 --> 05:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
doctor this is a medical decision this
 
05:04:16.350 --> 05:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
is not a decision men should be making
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
to rule over women's
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
bodies I have family that was in the
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%

05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
a lot in my career I want to just pull
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
up a line from the Fugitive Slave Act of
 
05:04:34.000 --> 05:04:40.830 align:start position:0%
up a line from the Fugitive Slave Act of

so forth
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
said that is what this bill uses
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
language from to
 
05:05:53.430 --> 05:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
Harbor that's to hide they didn't want
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
to say that but that's what that
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
means you don't want New Hampshire to be
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
the state that sets this President you
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't not in a state that already has 16
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
active hate groups and I would be
 
05:06:09.270 --> 05:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
willing to work with this committee to
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
make that happen but not this way thank
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
leak good afternoon chairman Roy and
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
Rebecca leak and I live in Andover and
 
05:06:42.510 --> 05:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in favor of HB
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
1991 as this bill criminalizes taking a
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
minor to obtain an abortion without the
 
05:06:49.350 --> 05:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
consent of the Minor's parents it makes
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
it illegal for traffickers and other
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
abusers to bring a minor to obtain an
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
abortion Studies have shown that
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
traffickers and other abusers use
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
abortions to cover up their heinous
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
crimes and abortion facilities have
 
05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
frequently failed to report child sexual
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse thus this law would help
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
protect vulnerable young women in girls
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
from abuse and suffering therefore I
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
urge you to recommend that hb1 91 ought
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you for considering my
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
testimony I welcome any
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions San thank you very much for
 
05:07:21.840 --> 05:07:28.470 align:start position:0%
questions San thank you very much for
your

05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony chair calls Jesse

Heath V something you're going to have
 
05:07:35.548 --> 05:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
to help me
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
ah good afternoon chairman Terry Roy
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Jennifer rhods and members of
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jesse Heath
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Vincent and as a father and a citizen
 
05:07:58.110 --> 05:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here to voice my opposition to this
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
bill this bill seeks to impose criminal
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
penalties on anyone who assists a minor
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
in obtaining an abortion without
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
parental approval I believe this
 
05:08:08.190 --> 05:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
approach is punitive unnecessary and
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
risks significant Harms to the
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of vulnerable
 
05:08:14.910 --> 05:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
minors governance is most effective when
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
conducted in a bipartisan manner with
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
compromises that reflect the diverse
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
needs and the values of our
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
communities unfortunately this bill does
 
05:08:25.830 --> 05:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
not reflect this principle instead it is
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
a divisive measure that clearly aims to
 
05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
allow parents of minors to restrict
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
their bodily
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
autonomy with through the threat of
 
05:08:32.638 --> 05:08:34.270 align:start position:0%
autonomy with through the threat of
criminal

05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
penalties RSA 132 already provides a
 
05:08:40.548 --> 05:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
well balanced bipartisan framework for
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
addressing these sensitive issues it
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
ensures that miners can seek abortion
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
care within a structure that
 
05:08:48.270 --> 05:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
incorporates parental involvement while
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
also safeguarding minor rights and
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
well-being introducing this bill creates
 
05:08:56.230 --> 05:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on abortion care
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
trusted adults and healthc care
 
05:08:59.948 --> 05:08:59.958 align:start position:0%
providers May fear a criminal
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
prosecution for supporting a minor
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
during a deeply personal and often
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
urgent decision-making process the broad
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
language would seem to apply to those uh
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
who would per perform escort care for
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
those seeking abortions to cross picket
 
05:09:14.958 --> 05:09:15.830 align:start position:0%
those seeking abortions to cross picket
lines

05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
Etc such an outcome would only serve to
 
05:09:21.788 --> 05:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
isolate miners in need forcing them into
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
unsafe and unsupported circumstances
 
05:09:26.948 --> 05:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
rather than advancing this bill I urge
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider strengthening
 
05:09:31.390 --> 05:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 132 section
 
05:09:34.788 --> 05:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
32-36 by adding narrowly tailored
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for individuals who
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
willfully fail to comply with its
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
punitive uh compliance with its
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions this would reinforce
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
accountability without introducing
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary duplication and punitive
 
05:09:47.470 --> 05:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
measures that could harm vulnerable
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
populations in conclusion I respectfully
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
request that this committee reject House
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 191 um lets us instead work
 
05:09:56.830 --> 05:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
together across party lines to ensure
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
that our laws protect minors uphold
 
05:10:01.868 --> 05:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and reflect the values
 
05:10:03.470 --> 05:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
of fairness and
 
05:10:06.548 --> 05:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
compassion thank you thank you could you
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um could you cite that again you said we
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
you thought we had to look at 132 yes uh
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
RSA 132 section specifically sections uh
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
32 through 36 and could you help do you
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
have any examples of what that would be
 
05:10:21.750 --> 05:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head or so that's
 
05:10:25.548 --> 05:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
the um notification requirements the
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
current requirements they already law
 
05:10:27.040 --> 05:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
current requirements they already law
that

05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
um mandate that the parents are notified
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay and so I think that that's like a
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
much better Avenue to explore um rather
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
than as as multiple people have
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
commented already about the other
 
05:10:43.750 --> 05:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who be caught up in this law
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
as currently written yeah I'm interested
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
specifically in the in the example I've
 
05:10:50.910 --> 05:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
cited uh about making sure that someone
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
who who has impregnated a minor and is
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
trying to force that minor to cover that
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
up through an abortion and the
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
notification might be the angle to
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
narrow that down
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
versus yeah I don't have any examples of
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that or anything like that I would just
 
05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
I was just saying that I think that
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's the the method to achieve what
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
this goal is the the stated goals of
 
05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you I appreciate it any
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
other questions see none thank you thank
 
05:11:19.230 --> 05:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
patch good afternoon chairman Roy and
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
05:11:35.230 --> 05:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
so much for uh taking uh this time to
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
listen to me um a lot I am here uh as a
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
res president of New Hampshire but today
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm really on acting on behalf of um two
 
05:11:46.830 --> 05:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
organizations one of the director of all
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
Girls alloud Incorporated and also a
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
05:11:54.750 --> 05:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
traffic free Coalition I know you've
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about traffic already but I
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
want to clarify a couple of points and
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
then give you a little bit more
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
statistics to help you understand this
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
problem a little better first of all I
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
heard the question if sex trafficking is
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
already illegal why do we need this
 
05:12:08.760 --> 05:12:09.708 align:start position:0%
already illegal why do we need this
spill

05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
spill
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
we need this spill because if we could
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
just go walk around the street and
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
identify the sex traffickers it would be
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
very easy to catch them but it's very
 
05:12:22.548 --> 05:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
difficult to catch a sex trafficker this
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill um enacting of this bill is one of
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
the ways that we will raise red flags to
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
help us identify sex traffickers and and
 
05:12:33.868 --> 05:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
um and then start those criminal
 
05:12:36.270 --> 05:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings also I've heard so many
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
people talk about how this bill is an
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
measure that will allow abort um their
 
05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
crimes to be covered up but in the case
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
of trafficking this is a this bill would
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
help to stop the continued exploitation
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
of girls who are stuck in sex
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking a recent study that was
 
05:13:01.270 --> 05:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
published in 2023 in the journal issues
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
in law and
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Medicine did um a complete reproductive
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
study on survivors of sex trafficking
 
05:13:12.270 --> 05:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
65% of those
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
survivors had at least one abortion so
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of numbers about how
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
many kids are being trafficked I'm here
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
to tell you 65% of those have had at
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
least one abortion the majority of them
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
have had multiple abortions One Survivor
 
05:13:30.190 --> 05:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
said at the age of 15 they put me in a
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
group home where I met a pimp who
 
05:13:35.430 --> 05:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
eventually forced me into prostitution
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
he was vicious and kept me under his
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
control by abusing me physically and
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
mentally I was homeless I felt like I
 
05:13:45.868 --> 05:13:45.878 align:start position:0%
didn't have anywhere to go anywhere to
 
05:13:48.548 --> 05:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
get clothes or food or shelter during
 
05:13:51.788 --> 05:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
the time I was trafficked I had three
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
abortions here's three other statements
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
from other survivors as part of this
 
05:14:00.030 --> 05:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
study I got pregnant 12 times I had
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
three abortions three children and many
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
miscarriages another one says I was
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant three times during the time I
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
was trafficked and all of them were by
 
05:14:09.958 --> 05:14:10.948 align:start position:0%
was trafficked and all of them were by
different

05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
buyers a third person said I felt that
 
05:14:16.830 --> 05:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances we were living
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
in one C hotel after another and I
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see any end to it I couldn't
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
bring a baby into the world so I had an
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
abortion the report goes on to state
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the responses given by the
 
05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
survivors show a clear lack of choice
 
05:14:36.670 --> 05:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
with regard to abortion and many
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
traffickers don't have any say
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever Darlene Pollock who was
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be here with me today is a
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
survivor of juvenile sex trafficking in
 
05:14:49.548 --> 05:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a valued colleague in
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
our work against trafficking and
 
05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
exploitation when she got pregnant her
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
trafficker said I will kill you if you
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
don't have an
 
05:15:00.750 --> 05:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
abortion survivors who endure this type
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
of ongoing trauma face not only
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
significant mental challenges but
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
potentially irreversible physical issues
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
One Survivor stated I had so many
 
05:15:14.070 --> 05:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
problems that I believe are connected to
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
when I was trafficked I had vaginal
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
infections UTI pelvic inflammatory
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
disease cysts and scar tissue from
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
abortions when I got out and married I
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't get pregnant now I have uterine
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
cancer New Hampshire girls who are stuck
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
in this cycle need our help to get out
 
05:15:38.430 --> 05:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
and imposing the penalties provided by
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is one way to intercept
 
05:15:44.190 --> 05:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking situations save victims and
 
05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
provide them with the support that they
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
really need so we arege you to follow
 
05:15:51.788 --> 05:15:51.798 align:start position:0%
the examples of Idaho and Tennessee on
 
05:15:54.350 --> 05:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
abortion trafficking and pass this
 
05:15:54.360 --> 05:15:55.868 align:start position:0%
abortion trafficking and pass this
important

05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
you um just a quick question if you
 
05:16:03.628 --> 05:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
don't mind yeah does this does this
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
language mirror those two states
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
identically or is it depart
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
significantly um I haven't had a chance
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
to to compare word by word um I think
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's close except that in our language
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's instate transportation to an
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
abortion okay right and I I can't speak
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
to all of the issues related to this
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill but definitely from a trafficking
 
05:16:29.230 --> 05:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
perspective our primary concern is as I
 
05:16:33.070 --> 05:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
stated this would help to stop ongoing
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
exploitation um because these girls are
 
05:16:37.628 --> 05:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
it it it just continues over and over
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
and over again and um and also just uh
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
trying to expose those traffickers and
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
get them off the street this is a great
 
05:16:50.830 --> 05:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
way to find them and um get them on that
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
path to Justice we would also urge the
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
state to consider good measures um for
 
05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
so some of these girls know that they
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
have a choice um they could give the
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
baby up for adoption there's there's
 
05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
other choices um and and provide some of
 
05:17:09.070 --> 05:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
the support services that are really
 
05:17:11.590 --> 05:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
needed if somebody makes that choice
 
05:17:11.600 --> 05:17:12.350 align:start position:0%
needed if somebody makes that choice
thank

05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%

05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
know so you said that this could help
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
identify those trackers or traffickers
 
05:17:31.708 --> 05:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
better than we already can um in what
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
way do you think that would happen
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
because again we come back to you
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
already have to do parental notification
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
for an abortion so if if this is the
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
problem we're trying to
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
solve how is the trafficker not being
 
05:17:48.548 --> 05:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
stopped or identified at that point when
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
the parent is being notified of the
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
abortion and like in what way does this
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
change that scenario at all I'm just not
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
sure how this will somehow bring to
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
light trafficking that has not been
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
already identified in other manners yes
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I I made
 
05:18:07.548 --> 05:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
a note to myself to explore more on the
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
par parental notification issue um but I
 
05:18:13.470 --> 05:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh and many of us have
 
05:18:16.190 --> 05:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
all seen like the sitcoms and and these
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
medical shows where there's the person
 
05:18:20.510 --> 05:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the hospital with the trafficking
 
05:18:24.750 --> 05:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
victim um so I'm not sure how the uh how
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
people get around that today um but
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
certainly that would have to be I think
 
05:18:33.590 --> 05:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
built into the implementation of this
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill um to ensure that that parental
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
notification is present and then when
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
additional you know questions
 
05:18:45.150 --> 05:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
conversation or whatever a flag goes up
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
to say this is a person who may be
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
trafficking this and it's not only just
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
the trafficker you know it's not these
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
guys are not going to come in and you're
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
going to see these crazy looking guys a
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
lot of times they use a bottom girl to
 
05:18:59.310 --> 05:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
do actually some of these
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
transportations and things like that and
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
manage their victim so it's might look
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
like a sister it might look like an aunt
 
05:19:08.548 --> 05:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
um those kinds of things and it may be
 
05:19:11.708 --> 05:19:11.718 align:start position:0%
that parental notification is easily
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
forged I I don't know what how that that
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
happen so thank you um well I guess that
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
kind of illustrates though what I'm
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't really see how it
 
05:19:22.590 --> 05:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
makes identifying the trafficker easier
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
because I I don't necessarily think you
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
know the traffickers following the girl
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
into the appointment Etc um for the
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
parental notification basically it's
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
written consent that has to be given or
 
05:19:35.350 --> 05:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
a written notification to the parents 48
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
hours before the appointment so there's
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
not really like a way to forge like that
 
05:19:40.150 --> 05:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
just written consent and then there's a
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charge for the provider if
 
05:19:44.430 --> 05:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
they don't um give that
 
05:19:44.440 --> 05:19:46.030 align:start position:0%
they don't um give that
notification

05:19:46.030 --> 05:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
notification
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess there's not too much of a
 
05:19:49.628 --> 05:19:49.638 align:start position:0%
question there but yeah I just I'm still
 
05:19:51.310 --> 05:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
stuck on this like I don't really see
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
how it increases the chance of
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
identifying these traffickers because
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're not following them in the
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
car like we're not going out to the car
 
05:20:00.750 --> 05:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
to bring the girl into the appointment
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean I'm just like I I
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
just don't see how this like yeah and
 
05:20:07.270 --> 05:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
and and it's prob and thank you for the
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
question it's probably very similar to
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
some of the ways that it's identified
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
now if a care provider suspects that
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's an issue then a red flag would
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
go up you know so a lot of it really
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
would be in the implementation of the
 
05:20:21.868 --> 05:20:21.878 align:start position:0%
bill for
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking my
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
question earlier today we heard a
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on a bill that actually dealt
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
directly with human trafficking and one
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we learned about was
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
that uh police officers ERS Homeland
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
Security and uh uh a bunch of different
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
advocacy organizations in New Hampshire
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
have been participating in something
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
called the human trafficking taas task
 
05:20:50.030 --> 05:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
force is that something that your
 
05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
organization participates in um thank
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh we are the New
 
05:20:56.910 --> 05:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire traffic free Coalition is is
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely aware of that some of our one
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
of our leaders used to be on the task
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
force in fact um
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
currently I actually went out to their
 
05:21:08.590 --> 05:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
website in preparation for this and and
 
05:21:10.708 --> 05:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
didn't find a lot of current information
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
out there um so I think we uh would love
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
to see um more engagement on that front
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
I I believe at one point they were
 
05:21:20.430 --> 05:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
separate organization and then they
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
merged with domestic violence um and so
 
05:21:26.030 --> 05:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
some of the trafficking issues kind of
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
got a little bit uh had to buy for
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
attention if you will um but we are
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
willing to work with anybody we are also
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to help in any way um
 
05:21:37.760 --> 05:21:39.030 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to help in any way um
to

05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:21:43.510 --> 05:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh advise inform um research investigate
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
um my other organization all girls
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
alloud has been fighting trafficking
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
mainly at the national level and so um
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
we're also following all federal laws
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
online exploitation and all of that so
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to help in any
 
05:22:00.510 --> 05:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you uh
 
05:22:00.520 --> 05:22:02.350 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you uh
representative

05:22:02.350 --> 05:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you I you know I too I'm very
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about the issue of sex
 
05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
trafficking I think it's a really
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
difficult issue it's hard it's hard to
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
discover it and and it's hard to punish
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
it um I think this bill is much broader
 
05:22:18.910 --> 05:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
than that as as we've heard so let me
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
ask you this question do you have a copy
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill with you uh I don't have the
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
copy of the bill I'm so
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
sorry okay the line seven reads
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
intentionally recruit or intentionally
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
Harbors or transfer transports a
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
pregnant un un unemancipated minor
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
within this state for the purpose of
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
then it goes on if that language were to
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
change to intentionally coerces or
 
05:22:48.190 --> 05:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
forces a pregnant unemancipated minor
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
within the state for the purpose of
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
would you uh would that deal more
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
directly with the sex trafficking
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue um thank you for the question I I
 
05:23:02.670 --> 05:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
believe it would and we would um we we
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be happy to see that from a
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking perspective thank you
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%

in the last week I've had two
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
conversations with an education
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
professional who works in a high school
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
in a small town in Southern New
 
05:24:29.230 --> 05:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and she told me that uh since
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
the start of school four months ago um
 
05:24:36.270 --> 05:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
she's had four young girls disclosed
 
05:24:38.910 --> 05:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
that they were uh they had unintended
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
and want unwanted pregnancies these
 
05:24:50.110 --> 05:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
girls were ages 17 16 15 and 13
 
05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
13 um in my uh sources
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
experience um the the number of girls
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
getting pregnant seems to be increasing
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
in her school despite National Trends
 
05:25:04.150 --> 05:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
and that the ages at which these young
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
girls conceive is actually getting
 
05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
younger now this is the observation of
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
one education professional multiply this
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
experience by every school nurse every
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor every teacher every
 
05:25:21.990 --> 05:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh coach every athletic trainer in every
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
High School in the state and you begin
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
to understand the scope of of the
 
05:25:28.350 --> 05:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
problem fortunately the issue of teen
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy has been on the medical radar
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
for some time and we do have good data
 
05:25:35.628 --> 05:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
regarding many aspects of this problem
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world all teens would
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
disclose their condition of their
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
parents and involve them in the
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
decision- making and I totally agree
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
that that is the best case scenario and
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
the optimal place for this to happen and
 
05:25:49.310 --> 05:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
in fact two-thirds of pregnant teens do
 
05:25:52.030 --> 05:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
disclose to their parents it is that
 
05:25:54.628 --> 05:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
other third for whom this legislation
 
05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
presents a problem data suggests that
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
they may have really good reasons for
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
not telling their parents including
 
05:26:03.150 --> 05:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
concern about being forced to continue
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy get the very real
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
possibility of getting kicked out of the
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
house and in rare cases being subjected
 
05:26:11.788 --> 05:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
to violence they may already be um
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
victims of incest or abuse so who are
 
05:26:17.350 --> 05:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
these pregnant teens especially the most
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the third that that feel that they
 
05:26:22.270 --> 05:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
cannot disclose well pregnant teenagers
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
are 7% of teenage girls in the United
 
05:26:26.910 --> 05:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
States they're most the they're most
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
likely from backgrounds of low income
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
low education and neighborhood
 
05:26:32.830 --> 05:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
disadvantage their pregnancies are
 
05:26:35.788 --> 05:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
diagnosed later and they enter prenatal
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
care later these girls are plagued by
 
05:26:40.990 --> 05:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
poor social support poor emotional
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
well-being and have high levels of
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
depression they have higher use of
 
05:26:47.788 --> 05:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
tobacco alcohol and recreational drugs
 
05:26:49.868 --> 05:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
and they do not change those habits
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy their home environments
 
05:26:55.548 --> 05:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
are often unstable or unsafe and some of
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
them are
 
05:27:00.110 --> 05:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
unhoused whether it is intended or not
 
05:27:02.310 --> 05:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
the effect of this bill will be to make
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care more difficult
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the most vulnerable pregnant teens
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
by Criminal izing the effort of those
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
who would help them it's well documented
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
that of all teens who choose to keep and
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
parent their babies only 40% of them
 
05:27:19.868 --> 05:27:19.878 align:start position:0%
will finish high school and of those
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
less than 2% will go on to finish
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
college pregnancies and adolescents are
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
highrisk and complex to treat um they
 
05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a higher incidence of ectopic
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%

05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
common unfortunately coercion and
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
intimate partner violence is a major
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
problem for this population and
 
05:27:50.430 --> 05:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
Adolescent mothers have a very high rate
 
05:27:53.070 --> 05:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
of repeat pregnancy a quarter of them
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
will be pregnant again within a year and
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
a third of them will be pregnant again
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
within two years and what happens to the
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
children that these that these teenage
 
05:28:06.150 --> 05:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
mothers bear um they because teenage
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
mothers who are coerced into having
 
05:28:09.868 --> 05:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
children children have much more
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
difficulty bonding with their children
 
05:28:13.868 --> 05:28:13.878 align:start position:0%
that the the the children have higher
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
rates of abuse and neglect are more
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
likely to become teen mothers themselves
 
05:28:19.948 --> 05:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
and are more likely to be incarcerated
 
05:28:21.788 --> 05:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
when you prevent women from accessing
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
abortion you subject them to the very
 
05:28:26.190 --> 05:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
serious risk of a pregnancy against
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
their will you threaten their health and
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
in few cases cause their deaths if a
 
05:28:33.548 --> 05:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
young pregnant cannot talk to their
 
05:28:35.868 --> 05:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
parents for whatever reason and any
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
other trusted adult in their sphere
 
05:28:40.230 --> 05:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
faces criminal prosecution for helping
 
05:28:43.708 --> 05:28:43.718 align:start position:0%
them please remember that suicide is the
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
second most common cause of death in
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 18 now why
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't they just uh emancipate themselves
 
05:28:53.310 --> 05:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify as an emancipated
 
05:28:55.350 --> 05:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
minor in New Hampshire an adolescent
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
must be married or in the military or
 
05:28:59.470 --> 05:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
living independently and managing their

own finances or they must petition the
 
05:29:04.110 --> 05:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
court for limit emancipation if they're
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 these requirements are Out Of
 
05:29:08.910 --> 05:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
Reach for most of the girls who would be
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
affected by this legislation including
 
05:29:10.718 --> 05:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
affected by this legislation including
that

05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
13-year-old further this bill may very
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
well be unconstitutional a law which
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
brings no health benefits to patients
 
05:29:20.670 --> 05:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
but makes abortion harder or impossible
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
to access violates the undue burden
 
05:29:25.470 --> 05:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
standard that the Supreme Court has used
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
to evaluate abortion restrictions since
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood vcy in addition an
 
05:29:32.830 --> 05:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
abortion restriction whose stated
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
purpose is to protect Women's Health
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
must be based on demonstrated benefits
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
and not just on the stated intent of the
 
05:29:42.910 --> 05:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
lawmaker this bill will not accomp is
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
not accompanied by valid data or
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
empirical studies that indicate that it
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
would actually improve Women's Health if
 
05:29:51.548 --> 05:29:51.558 align:start position:0%
your intent is to reduce the incidents
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
of abortion in New Hampshire it would be
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
a much more productive use of your
 
05:29:58.350 --> 05:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
legislative powers to address the root
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
causes of teen pregnancy provide sex

housing and the social safety net which
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
these girls desperately need for

successful adolescent parenting those
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
objections are not addressed in in h

heard and that I that I've heard from
 
05:31:20.788 --> 05:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
Physicians um you know that that
 
05:31:22.910 --> 05:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between the patient and

trafficking um in New Hampshire and um
 
05:31:39.470 --> 05:31:39.480 align:start position:0%

minors and we don't feel that this Bill
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
gets at the heart of that issue
 
05:31:48.270 --> 05:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a concern that the bill will
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%

05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%

05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%

and um support system for miners that
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
are being trafficked um as we've heard
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
before um the likelihood of minors
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
seeking um procedures outside of the
 
05:32:14.910 --> 05:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
medical system will probably increase if
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
it's perceived to be an unsafe um
 
05:32:22.430 --> 05:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
resource for if the medical um abortions
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
are perceived to be an unsafe
 
05:32:28.270 --> 05:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
resource um which will result in
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
decreased access to appropriate medical
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
care for these young women further
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
victimizing them and it will not change
 
05:32:38.750 --> 05:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
the the the experience of being
 
05:32:40.750 --> 05:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
trafficked it will not change the
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
experience of being pregnant but it
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
could change the outcome of their
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
medical care so we'd like to ask you to
 
05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
not support this bill um and I I will
 
05:33:00.270 --> 05:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.670 --> 05:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
tight quarters back there good afternoon
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking the time
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
to hear my testimony uh for the record
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Courtney Reid and I serve as
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
policy Advocate on behalf of the ACLU
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here to testify an
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
191 uh we've heard a lot of concerns uh
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
with different provisions of the bill
 
05:33:49.390 --> 05:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to speak to the
 
05:33:51.070 --> 05:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
Constitutional threats that it would
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
impose on granite Staters um in a few
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
different ways uh I speak to these in
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
more detail in my testimony so I'll just
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
outline them at a high level for now um
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
the first concern we have is with how
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
the bill might affect freedom of speech
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
and expression
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
for grite Staters uh mostly because it
 
05:34:13.708 --> 05:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
is unclear what activities would be
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
prohibited under the bills uh harboring
 
05:34:16.480 --> 05:34:17.470 align:start position:0%
prohibited under the bills uh harboring
and

05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
transport uh language so for example uh
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
with harboring could sitting in uh a
 
05:34:27.150 --> 05:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
room with a counselor exploring one's
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
options constitute harboring um would
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
encouragement or emotional support or
 
05:34:35.310 --> 05:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
outof state referrals fundraising
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
coordinating Transportation um would any
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
of these activities which are protected
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
act activities that constitute free
 
05:34:45.310 --> 05:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
speech and freedom of expression uh
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
would they be
 
05:34:49.150 --> 05:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited under this bill and to
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that the reason why the
 
05:34:53.670 --> 05:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
courts have deemed these activities is
 
05:34:55.390 --> 05:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
protected activities is because they are
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
serving to communicate a core belief of
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
supporting abortion access and the right
 
05:35:01.920 --> 05:35:02.628 align:start position:0%
supporting abortion access and the right
to

05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
abortion um with that lack of clarity I
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
think that bridges into the second
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
concern that we have with the bill which
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
is a due process or one's ability to be
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
treated fairly and equally under the law
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh 14th Amendment concern and that's
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
just because the bill is vague and that
 
05:35:23.708 --> 05:35:23.718 align:start position:0%
it would require adults to make
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
individual determinations about whether
 
05:35:28.910 --> 05:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
or not they are harboring or
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
transporting so it would leave a
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
supportive adults in a position of
 
05:35:36.390 --> 05:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
individually attempting to determine
 
05:35:38.670 --> 05:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
just how much support they could provide
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
to a young person without those actions
 
05:35:44.110 --> 05:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
being interpreted as a criminal offense
 
05:35:46.510 --> 05:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
and ultimately this would as we heard in
 
05:35:48.750 --> 05:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
the past testimony really discourage
 
05:35:51.030 --> 05:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable young people from seeking
 
05:35:53.070 --> 05:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
support and exploring their
 
05:35:56.350 --> 05:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
options lastly um I think these things
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
really raise a lot of questions as to
 
05:36:00.670 --> 05:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill would look like on the
 
05:36:03.310 --> 05:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
ground and it certainly raises questions
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
about the fundamental right to
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
travel uh the bill has a provision
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
regarding obtaining or procuring
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
abortions with language States
 
05:36:16.830 --> 05:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of the location so of course
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
abortion is legal and accessible in New
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it's also legal and
 
05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
accessible in other states and so um
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill is doing in effect would
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
be prohibiting Interstate travel um it
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
would it would mean that it would be
 
05:36:32.190 --> 05:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for individuals to go to other
 
05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
states where they would be legally
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
accessing care and then being at risk of
 
05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses in New
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and with that I think that
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
really raises questions as to what
 
05:36:44.670 --> 05:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement would look like would there
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
be someone watching the border on
 
05:36:52.110 --> 05:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
93 um lastly we have another concern
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
with the need to go to a notorized um or
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
a public notary to receive parental
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
consent uh I think there's just a lot of
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh having public health
 
05:37:05.310 --> 05:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
information uh in the hands of someone
 
05:37:08.910 --> 05:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
else um who to my understanding would
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
not be a hippo protected official um
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
with those things we have other concerns
 
05:37:16.590 --> 05:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions on them
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
but uh ultimately Granite Staters value
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
access to abortion they value their
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
privacy and this bill uh fundamentally
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
would bolster government interference
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
into the private life of granite Staters
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and families and so for those reasons
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
we would ask the committee to itl this
 
05:37:41.548 --> 05:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
bill um with that happy to take
 
05:37:43.948 --> 05:37:43.958 align:start position:0%
questions thank you could you point me
 
05:37:45.868 --> 05:37:45.878 align:start position:0%
to the section that talks about
 
05:37:49.150 --> 05:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
interstate I I can't find that sure uh
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
just give me one moment um I'm looking
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
at the amendment to HB
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
191 uh and in line 12 uh procuring it
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
closes with regardless of where the
 
05:38:05.150 --> 05:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
abortion is to be procured and in line
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
15 regardless of where the inducing drug
 
05:38:08.718 --> 05:38:11.470 align:start position:0%
15 regardless of where the inducing drug
is

05:38:11.470 --> 05:38:11.480 align:start position:0%

uh somebody coming in and and uh being
 
05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%

05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee excuse me I will be very brief
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
I know this hearing has gone quite over
 
05:40:11.708 --> 05:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
U my name is Kayla Montgomery I'm the
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
vice president of public affairs for
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
planed Parenthood New Hampshire action
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
fund and PPN um it's nice to be back in
 
05:40:19.628 --> 05:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
this committee um I just really wanted
 
05:40:20.830 --> 05:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
to briefly talk about the parental
 
05:40:22.510 --> 05:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
notification law in New Hampshire
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
because that has come up a couple times
 
05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know I think it's just really
 
05:40:28.510 --> 05:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
important that we remember that the vast
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
majority of teens um already involve
 
05:40:33.310 --> 05:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
their parents in these decisions around
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um and they would do so
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of a state mandate but here
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we do have a state
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
mandate um parental notification has
 
05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
been uh on the books for well over a
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
decade here in this state and of course
 
05:40:48.750 --> 05:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
Planned Parent of Northern New England
 
05:40:51.468 --> 05:40:51.478 align:start position:0%
uh is a nonprofit healthcare providers
 
05:40:53.948 --> 05:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
that follows all state and federal laws
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh if we didn't we would have to close
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
our doors and we couldn't serve patients
 
05:41:00.468 --> 05:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
um so we certainly at Planned Parenthood
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
and all abortion providers comply with
 
05:41:04.350 --> 05:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
the law especially on Parental
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
notification um and it's very explicit
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
pintal notification is very explicit in
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
the law where it's laid out it's RSA 132
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
sections 32 through 36 so it gives
 
05:41:17.948 --> 05:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
really clear guidelines of how to comply
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the law so like I said often most
 
05:41:22.750 --> 05:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
often a parent will come in um but if
 
05:41:24.150 --> 05:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
you look at the RSA you can see some
 
05:41:26.110 --> 05:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
more details about what else can be done
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
around written notice to the home
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
address uh delivered personally uh at
 
05:41:32.830 --> 05:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
least 48 hours in advance you can look
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
through all those yourself if you'd like
 
05:41:36.430 --> 05:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
um and of course there's a couple of
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
small um exceptions to this one being a
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
medical emergency if there's no time um
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
insufficient time to provide the notice
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then the other case um and
 
05:41:49.628 --> 05:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
fortunately it's very rare but it does
 
05:41:51.310 --> 05:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
happen where um a young person feels
 
05:41:52.910 --> 05:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
like they can't notify their parent and
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
so judicial bypass is an option um it
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often if you wanted
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
to know more about those numbers of how
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
often that happens um New Hampshire
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
Superior Court um I believe could
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
provide those numbers um but we're not
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of cases there we're
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking um you know really a handful a
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
year um and then secondly um the issue
 
05:42:15.070 --> 05:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
of coercion has come up a couple times
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make really clear
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
that that is something that Planned
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and New Hampshire abortion
 
05:42:24.510 --> 05:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
providers really um take care of and
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
scan for and make sure that that's not
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
happening um and this is really built
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
into all of our intake procedures making
 
05:42:33.468 --> 05:42:33.478 align:start position:0%
sure that no coercion is happening
 
05:42:35.310 --> 05:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
asking the patient lots of questions
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
asking them during the intake procedure
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
in alone asking multiple times asking um
 
05:42:42.590 --> 05:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
even during the procedure uh and if
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
anything comes up we could certainly
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
would uh flag that would stop the
 
05:42:48.270 --> 05:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
procedure would make sure that people
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
are comfortable it is individualized
 
05:42:52.590 --> 05:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
care and making sure that know one as
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
being coerced into having an abortion is
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
of utmost priority so I just wanted to
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
um just mention those couple of things
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.468 --> 05:43:05.478 align:start position:0%
questions see no questions thank you
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
very much is there anyone else wish to
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
testify who has not turned in the pink
 
05:43:12.750 --> 05:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
card or testified already seeing none I
 
05:43:14.350 --> 05:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
hereby close the public hearing on House
 
05:43:14.360 --> 05:43:16.468 align:start position:0%
hereby close the public hearing on House
Bill

57 excuse me that's incorrect House Bill
 
05:43:26.590 --> 05:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
191 um and we open the house bill
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
57 and I invite the prime sponsor
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:40.270 --> 05:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:43.990 --> 05:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
57 no one I just have
 
05:43:46.070 --> 05:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
one okay good I want to hurry up I get
 
05:43:51.070 --> 05:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:53.468 --> 05:43:53.478 align:start position:0%
ambitious I was
 
05:43:56.110 --> 05:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
going see
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:09.120 --> 05:44:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
she

05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:23.708 --> 05:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
organization ala okay thank you Mr chair
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh my name is representative David Muse
 
05:44:33.230 --> 05:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm from Rockingham uh District 37
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
representing the city of Portsmouth and
 
05:44:38.468 --> 05:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
the towns of Newington and Newcastle
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the great pleasures of being a
 
05:44:41.590 --> 05:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislator on this committee are the
 
05:44:43.350 --> 05:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
relationships we develop with the people
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
who come before us over the summer I
 
05:44:48.350 --> 05:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
contacted Helen Hanks the commissioner
 
05:44:50.788 --> 05:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Corrections and I
 
05:44:52.468 --> 05:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
asked her if there was any legislation
 
05:44:54.468 --> 05:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
on her mind that would be helpful for me
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
to file the bill before us today is the
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
05:45:02.430 --> 05:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
conversation what HB 57 would do would
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
be to allow a person under the control
 
05:45:06.150 --> 05:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the department who's been approved
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
for release under administrative home
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
confinement to participate in
 
05:45:12.468 --> 05:45:12.478 align:start position:0%
postsecondary educational opportunities
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the community where they've been
 
05:45:16.590 --> 05:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
accepted for enrollment under the
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
current law residents in our state
 
05:45:20.510 --> 05:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
prison system who are approved for
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement are
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
authorized to take part in employment
 
05:45:27.230 --> 05:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities and uncompensated public
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
service outside their home as long as
 
05:45:32.750 --> 05:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
they return to their home by a specific
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
time this bill would simply add
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
attending college courses as part of
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
their confinement and that's it what the
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill does not do is change
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility anything about the process
 
05:45:48.430 --> 05:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
or any other aspect of the law it also
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the Department's policies
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
for administrative home confinement and
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
to be very clear this is not a program
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
that just any Resident in our state
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
prison system uh is eligible for uh any
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
Resident who's had disruptive or violent
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues or who's been
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
convicted of committing uh uh Escape uh
 
05:46:14.910 --> 05:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
aggravated DOI or any one of a long list
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
of violent crimes is not eligible for
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
administrative home
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
confinement just like those working a
 
05:46:23.468 --> 05:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
job or on an
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship people attending college
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
courses under administrative home
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
confinement will be supervised and
 
05:46:31.270 --> 05:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
monitored by the divisions or by the
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
Department's division of field services
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
who check their location through
 
05:46:38.670 --> 05:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring and home visits
 
05:46:40.510 --> 05:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state is negligible
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
which which is why we we don't have a
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with this one uh and also a
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
question that I know that comes up
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
frequently when we talk about secondary
 
05:46:51.230 --> 05:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education for for inmates
 
05:46:53.868 --> 05:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
is who's paying for it uh the answer
 
05:46:57.070 --> 05:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
here is it's the inmates the families it
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
could be scholarships it's not the state
 
05:47:00.430 --> 05:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
of New
 
05:47:02.948 --> 05:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but while the cost is
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
negligible um the results are tangible
 
05:47:07.868 --> 05:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
and real uh separate studies from both
 
05:47:10.190 --> 05:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
the ran corporation uh and the Vera
 
05:47:12.430 --> 05:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
Institute have found that incarcerated
 
05:47:14.070 --> 05:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
people who participate in college
 
05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
programs are 43 to 48% less likely to be
 
05:47:21.628 --> 05:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
reincarceration than those who don't and
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
employment rates for formally
 
05:47:25.390 --> 05:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerated students also increase by
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
an average of 10% after participating in
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
postsecondary educational opportunities
 
05:47:33.628 --> 05:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
so in essence what it does is it it
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
provides people with a better
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity not to reoffend not to come
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
back um I would ask that you hold your
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions um I am not an expert on
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement we have
 
05:47:48.030 --> 05:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
people here who are who can answer any
 
05:47:50.468 --> 05:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
questions you have about the process I
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
understand that Nick Duffy from the
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
Department's division of rehabilitative
 
05:47:56.110 --> 05:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
services uh is actually going to testify
 
05:47:57.948 --> 05:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
and he can answer any specific questions
 
05:48:00.430 --> 05:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
you have around how administrative home
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
confinement Works uh or why the
 
05:48:05.070 --> 05:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
department is specifically asking for
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation at this time
 
05:48:11.110 --> 05:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um uh my name is Nick Duppy I
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
the director of rehabilitative services
 
05:49:12.030 --> 05:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:49:14.390 --> 05:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh and thank you to
 
05:49:16.708 --> 05:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
representative Muse for bringing this um
 
05:49:18.990 --> 05:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
legislation forward uh we think it's
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
really important for education and
 
05:49:22.830 --> 05:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
providing opportunities for people to
 
05:49:25.788 --> 05:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
engage in education um as representative
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
Muse stated um the statistics are clear
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
on uh the benefits and uh reduction in
 
05:49:36.270 --> 05:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
um reincarceration that occurs um when
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
when those individuals uh participate in
 
05:49:42.510 --> 05:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
um in higher education opportunities
 
05:49:45.788 --> 05:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
specifically uh our uh again this
 
05:49:48.270 --> 05:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
legislation really just adds in that
 
05:49:49.990 --> 05:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
they for participation in higher
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
education opportunities um are are we do
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
a thorough review process for people who
 
05:49:59.390 --> 05:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
are um requesting to go um on
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement that
 
05:50:04.830 --> 05:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
includes reviewing housing reviewing um
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
how they're going to finally support
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
themselves uh treatment opportunities um
 
05:50:13.708 --> 05:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
we we review the their entire uh release
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
plan um and make sure that we we believe
 
05:50:18.190 --> 05:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
that release plan is going to set them
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
up for Success um upon release and and
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
education is a part of those um
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
opportuni so we want them to be engaged
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
in treatment we want them to be engaged
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
um in uh really Community Services
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to help um them be
 
05:50:36.270 --> 05:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
successful upon release uh their
 
05:50:39.150 --> 05:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
behavior avior is a huge factor in us
 
05:50:41.788 --> 05:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
our approval if they're not behaving
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
themselves if they haven't completed
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
programming if they haven't done the
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
things they've needed uh to show that
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
they're ready for release um their
 
05:50:51.310 --> 05:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
application would be
 
05:50:54.468 --> 05:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
denied um I'd be willing to take any
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
lels yes thank thank you for uh taking
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:51:07.080 --> 05:51:08.110 align:start position:0%
my question
I'm

05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:51:11.948 --> 05:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
um concerned about the definition of
 
05:51:11.958 --> 05:51:13.590 align:start position:0%
um concerned about the definition of
postsecondary

05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
postsecondary
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
Education would that include perhaps uh
 
05:51:24.030 --> 05:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
education in the trades or a uh um an
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
internship where uh a prisoner would go
 
05:51:32.590 --> 05:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
out on various sites and work with a
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
journeyman uh would that be includ
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
included in postsecondary education uh
 
05:51:39.390 --> 05:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
yes it would be thank you for the
 
05:51:44.110 --> 05:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
question but yes it would be um I uh uh
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
any any really would be any accredited
 
05:51:49.390 --> 05:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
college or university that um could
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
provide that education um that would be
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
a part of that um that
 
05:51:54.878 --> 05:51:57.110 align:start position:0%
a part of that um that
request

05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:52:00.670 --> 05:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
followup your definition of college or
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
university uh many of the trades go
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
through trade schools and and and and so
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
forth so you know college or
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
university um is a little bit different
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
from my idea of becoming a plumber or a
 
05:52:22.708 --> 05:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
carpenter or or a farmer or something
 
05:52:22.718 --> 05:52:24.110 align:start position:0%
carpenter or or a farmer or something
like

05:52:24.110 --> 05:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
that so there's an accreditation process
 
05:52:30.670 --> 05:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
for uh educational institutions um and
 
05:52:33.270 --> 05:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
so they would have to fall under um the
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
accreditation procedures for uh I guess
 
05:52:40.030 --> 05:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education uh services so
 
05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
typically postsecondary education would
 
05:52:44.750 --> 05:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
be that post High School level so if
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a community college
 
05:52:49.788 --> 05:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
system would would qualify so we would
 
05:52:52.350 --> 05:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
have to look at that but if you feel
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
that you think we need more detail and
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
that another
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
follow-ups my my only concern is that
 
05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
based upon the way this is written it
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
might give someone the idea that we're
 
05:53:16.350 --> 05:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
separating trade schools from
 
05:53:18.788 --> 05:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
colleges and in
 
05:53:18.798 --> 05:53:20.628 align:start position:0%
colleges and in
today's

05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
today's
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
um economic
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
environment uh becoming a plumber is
 
05:53:29.708 --> 05:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
better than becoming uh a history
 
05:53:31.230 --> 05:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
teacher for
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
instance yeah we understand that I think
 
05:53:36.510 --> 05:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
the intent is is that going into the
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
trades um would be a part of uh the
 
05:53:43.030 --> 05:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
education with this so um uh that's
 
05:53:44.670 --> 05:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
something that we could absolutely look
 
05:53:47.548 --> 05:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
into and and provide some uh more clear
 
05:53:50.590 --> 05:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
guidance on on that language and but
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely it's the intent wasn't
 
05:53:55.788 --> 05:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
to separate those it was uh that they
 
05:53:58.788 --> 05:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
could go into a a trade um but anything
 
05:54:01.390 --> 05:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
sort of uh um I guess I'm looking at it
 
05:54:04.510 --> 05:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
almost as post high school education um
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh so vocational training um that they
 
05:54:07.868 --> 05:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
could they could
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
attend thank
 
05:54:10.440 --> 05:54:12.910 align:start position:0%
attend thank
you

05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:54:17.070 --> 05:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
share thank you madam Pier um and thank
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%

05:54:20.120 --> 05:54:20.990 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um I know houses
of

05:54:20.990 --> 05:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections are authorized to uh Grant
 
05:54:27.788 --> 05:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
Work Release often at the recommendation
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
of a a sentencing judge uh does the
 
05:54:33.548 --> 05:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
state prison are they included within
 
05:54:36.830 --> 05:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
that legislation that authorizes
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh work release yeah so we we have um
 
05:54:42.468 --> 05:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
Work Release we run three transitional
 
05:54:44.468 --> 05:54:44.478 align:start position:0%
housing units and a transitional work
 
05:54:47.948 --> 05:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
center um where people can um once
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
authorized by the courts to be on work
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
release they can go into the community
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh participate in uh work yes uh
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and would to follow up on uh
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative lel's question would an
 
05:55:04.990 --> 05:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
internship uh with uh an electrician
 
05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
master electrician or or D an
 
05:55:10.948 --> 05:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
electrician or a plumber would uh would
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
that qualify for work
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
release um so yes um that would uh
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um they're getting
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
paid um to do that so they're still
 
05:55:25.948 --> 05:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
getting a a paycheck like everyone else
 
05:55:27.030 --> 05:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
um even though they're doing the
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship they get paid as well for
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
that what if they weren't get pting paid
 
05:55:33.150 --> 05:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
for the I'm sorry follow-up
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
question what if they weren't getting
 
05:55:40.110 --> 05:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
paid it was just a a a a free
 
05:55:40.120 --> 05:55:41.948 align:start position:0%
paid it was just a a a a free
internship

05:55:41.948 --> 05:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
internship
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
um would that matter I don't believe so
 
05:55:48.270 --> 05:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
they can still be a part of our programs
 
05:55:50.430 --> 05:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
um with work release the thing with work
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
release Tech U typically is that they're
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
still working because they need to be
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
able to support themselves in some way
 
05:55:58.548 --> 05:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
so they might be working part-time in
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
those cases so they are still working um
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
they're just getting an opportunity to
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
um to uh do additional education through
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
the apprenti ship but we don't I haven't
 
05:56:09.750 --> 05:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
seen any that aren't getting paid
 
05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
through that their internship but um yes
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
that would that would cover it thank you
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you represent roads thank you Mr
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um this question might be
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for Miss Graham and it was
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a followup on representative L
 
05:56:27.150 --> 05:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
cell's question so in in the example of
 
05:56:29.230 --> 05:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
let's say the person is is being
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
released on a like a work release
 
05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
and generally that would be you know
 
05:56:38.190 --> 05:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
you're going from a specifically to be
 
05:56:39.948 --> 05:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
in a scenario like let's say maybe it
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be like a construction site right
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
05:56:45.910 --> 05:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
person is now maybe going with like a
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
different group of people could you
 
05:56:50.190 --> 05:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
maybe explain how is that something that
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
you would basically be able to supervise
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
or manage that or be able to make the
 
05:56:56.590 --> 05:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
decision on who would be able to qualify
 
05:56:59.788 --> 05:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
for as an example as a trade not
 
05:57:01.628 --> 05:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to a specific
 
05:57:01.638 --> 05:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to a specific
education

05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:57:06.468 --> 05:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
building so thank you for that question
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative I I want to be careful
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we're not conflating um
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement and work
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
release because they're two separate
 
05:57:17.230 --> 05:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
sections um administrative home
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
confinement as far as monitoring is
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
concerned they would have electronic
 
05:57:24.350 --> 05:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring um they it's different from
 
05:57:25.948 --> 05:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
work release it's just a separate
 
05:57:30.750 --> 05:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
separate set of Statute um so F you know
 
05:57:32.190 --> 05:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
um director Duffy talked a little bit
 
05:57:34.510 --> 05:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
about our work release programs and what
 
05:57:36.430 --> 05:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
people are authorized to do current ly
 
05:57:38.350 --> 05:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
under current law with administrative
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
home confinement um employment in
 
05:57:43.990 --> 05:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
general is a criteria that the
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner can use to release somebody
 
05:57:50.548 --> 05:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
on administrative home confinement um we
 
05:57:53.310 --> 05:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
this is why we were looking to add um
 
05:57:55.628 --> 05:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
education to that but are you asking
 
05:57:57.190 --> 05:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
about like accredit how would we look at
 
05:57:59.070 --> 05:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
accreditation of the program or how
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
would we monitor them when they're
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
out yeah the latter so you know like I
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
have a I have a friend that owns a
 
05:58:09.310 --> 05:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
suspended ceing company right so he he
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
is happy to train anybody that wants to
 
05:58:12.910 --> 05:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
do that cuz he doesn't want to do it
 
05:58:15.310 --> 05:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
anymore right so in this situation like
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
if he was contacted and he was like yep
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do that how how would that
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
because he's not go you're not going to
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
a specific building you're going to job
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
sites multiple job sites throughout the
 
05:58:27.670 --> 05:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
day so how would you be able to monitor
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
that or make the decision who was able
 
05:58:32.190 --> 05:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
to qualify for that thank you for that
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
um so we use electronic monitoring for
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on administrative
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
home confinement for lack of a better
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
term ankle bracelet um we can monitor
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
their location they're under the
 
05:58:45.150 --> 05:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
supervision of our Field Services
 
05:58:47.350 --> 05:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
Division so they would have a probation
 
05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
parole officer who would be following
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
their case doing home visits um they
 
05:58:55.910 --> 05:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be uh also office visits so they
 
05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
are under supervision with an officer
 
05:58:59.230 --> 05:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
directly but they also have that
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
electronic piece so that we can monitor
 
05:59:03.830 --> 05:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
where they are you're
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
welcome see no further questions thank
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
you give you a testimony is there anyone
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
else wishing to testify on this bill who
 
05:59:12.910 --> 05:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
has not being none I here by Clos public
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:36.910 --> 05:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Claudia stelle from aworth and
 
05:59:41.948 --> 05:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
I'm an adjunct in the community college
 
05:59:45.030 --> 05:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
system I teach at River Valley um I a
 
05:59:47.468 --> 05:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
remedial math class there and I would
 
05:59:49.788 --> 05:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
just I'm speaking in favor of this bill
 
05:59:54.670 --> 05:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
I've had students from 17 to 66 and one
 
05:59:56.430 --> 05:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
person that I'm thinking of particularly
 
05:59:58.590 --> 05:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
when I heard about this bill was a young
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
man who had been um in the in the
 
06:00:05.510 --> 06:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
judicial system as a youngster so he was
 
06:00:08.590 --> 06:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
coming to my class with about a sixth
 
06:00:12.468 --> 06:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
grade education in math um and the math
 
06:00:14.070 --> 06:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
class I teach is a really good
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to build confidence as well
 
06:00:19.310 --> 06:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
as skills and I just think that this is
 
06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity to help people who
 
06:00:25.468 --> 06:00:25.478 align:start position:0%
have um a lot of students who are in the
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
community college system are working out
 
06:00:31.628 --> 06:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
of their comfort zones they are trying
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
to build skill levels um that that they
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have overcome bad experiences
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
that they had when they were for this
 
06:00:42.910 --> 06:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
young man in junior high but for most
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
students in high school um and trying to
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
get to a place where they can get um a
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
certificate or an associates degree um
 
06:00:56.230 --> 06:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
some of them then go on to get uh
 
06:00:58.910 --> 06:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's and Masters as well but um
 
06:01:01.830 --> 06:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
they are they're starting the process of
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
trying to um build up their skill level
 
06:01:07.708 --> 06:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
over overcome learning disabilities that
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
they may have maybe mental illness
 
06:01:12.910 --> 06:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
issues or or physical health issues so
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
that they can actually you know better
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
themselves when we talk about pulling
 
06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
people pulling themselves up by by their
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
bootstraps col community college
 
06:01:25.310 --> 06:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
students are doing that and if this bill
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
allows us to expand the number of of
 
06:01:31.830 --> 06:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
people who can take part in that program
 
06:01:34.708 --> 06:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
and then can get to a place where they
 
06:01:36.910 --> 06:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
are becoming productive members of
 
06:01:41.430 --> 06:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
society and not um falling back into Old
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
Habits or old whatever and and end up
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
being in prison again I think it's a
 
06:01:49.468 --> 06:01:49.478 align:start position:0%
great idea thank you thank you for your
 
06:01:52.270 --> 06:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
testimony see no
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
questions s thank you for taking my
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
question and I truly appreciate the work
 
06:02:01.910 --> 06:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you do um I'm just wondering in
 
06:02:04.390 --> 06:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
your case where do you deliver your
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
classes are they inside the walls are
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
they at your junior college or where
 
06:02:14.868 --> 06:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
where is it that you deliver your
 
06:02:17.070 --> 06:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
classes so I teach at River Valley
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
Community College at usually at the Keen
 
06:02:23.468 --> 06:02:23.478 align:start position:0%
Center um River Valley has a campus in
 
06:02:25.150 --> 06:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont but they have two Satellite
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
campuses as well so I'm usually at the
 
06:02:30.510 --> 06:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
Keem campus and we are now on the Keen
 
06:02:32.310 --> 06:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
State College campus so I'm either
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
teaching in the River Valley building
 
06:02:36.230 --> 06:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
which is on the edge of Campus or I'm
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
teaching in one of the Comm one of the
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
classrooms um on the Keen State campus
 
06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes um the classes are hybrid
 
06:02:49.390 --> 06:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're in person okay
 
06:02:53.230 --> 06:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
followup so if if you were able to
 
06:02:55.868 --> 06:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
participate as this
 
06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
envisions how would the
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
prisoners who are getting ready to be uh
 
06:03:08.468 --> 06:03:08.478 align:start position:0%
paroled or whatever getting out of
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
prison how would they participate in
 
06:03:14.110 --> 06:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
your classes would they come to you for
 
06:03:14.120 --> 06:03:15.110 align:start position:0%
your classes would they come to you for
those

06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
classes um sir I I'm I'm not sure
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
because the I I I'm not familiar with
 
06:03:26.230 --> 06:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
what the um what the prison system is
 
06:03:29.948 --> 06:03:29.958 align:start position:0%
okay but um they could participate
 
06:03:31.948 --> 06:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
remotely okay in other words they could
 
06:03:35.230 --> 06:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
stay wherever they are already located
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
and then um join the class by Zoom or
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
they could come in person I think that
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's something to be said for uh
 
06:03:46.830 --> 06:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
inperson teaching particularly at this
 
06:03:50.110 --> 06:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
level at the lower levels where people
 
06:03:53.708 --> 06:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
um they're they're rebuilding confidence
 
06:03:57.150 --> 06:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
as much as skills and and it that
 
06:04:00.590 --> 06:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
requires a a personal relationship so
 
06:04:04.270 --> 06:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
being in the same room together helps
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you is
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wishing to testify
 
06:04:13.750 --> 06:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close the public
 
06:04:16.390 --> 06:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
hearing and I open the public hearing on
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 511 and invite the prime
 
06:04:20.150 --> 06:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor to come forward and introduce
 
06:04:37.750 --> 06:04:37.760 align:start position:0%

Safety Committee thank you for the
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to introduce House
 
06:04:48.670 --> 06:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 511 legislation designed to
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
strengthen Public Safety and uphold the
 
06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
rule of law in New Hampshire over the
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
years New Hampshire has prided itself on
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
being a state that values safety
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
community and respect for the laws of
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
our land HB 511 reflects those values by
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
addressing a critical Gap in our legal
 
06:05:07.868 --> 06:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
framework the need to ensure cooperation
 
06:05:10.468 --> 06:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
between local and state entities and
 
06:05:12.670 --> 06:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement in matters of
 
06:05:14.590 --> 06:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
immigration this bill makes it clear
 
06:05:16.750 --> 06:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire will not support
 
06:05:19.150 --> 06:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
policies or practices that obstruct the
 
06:05:21.468 --> 06:05:21.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration laws
 
06:05:23.708 --> 06:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
let me get let me Begin by explaining
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
why this bill is necessary across the
 
06:05:28.670 --> 06:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
country so-called Sanctuary policies
 
06:05:30.270 --> 06:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
have created challenges for law
 
06:05:32.590 --> 06:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement undermining their ability to
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with federal
 
06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
agencies the these policies often result
 
06:05:39.430 --> 06:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
in dangerous individuals avoiding
 
06:05:42.030 --> 06:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
deportation returning to communities and
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
committing further crimes while New
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has largely avoided the issue
 
06:05:48.150 --> 06:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen troubling examples in other
 
06:05:50.468 --> 06:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
states that aren't too far away that
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
highlight the risks HB 511 takes a
 
06:05:55.390 --> 06:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
proactive approach to ensure this does
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
not become a problem here this bill does
 
06:06:01.270 --> 06:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
three things primarily it prohibits
 
06:06:03.070 --> 06:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
state and local government entities from
 
06:06:05.788 --> 06:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
adopting Sanctuary policies this ensures
 
06:06:07.628 --> 06:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
a consistent approach to law enforcement
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
across the state a patchwork of
 
06:06:12.190 --> 06:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
conflicting policies creates confusion
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
inefficiency and risks it mandates
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
cooperation with Federal immigration
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
authorities law enforcement agencies
 
06:06:21.070 --> 06:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
will be required to honor immigration
 
06:06:23.390 --> 06:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
detainers allow Federal authorities
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
access to individuals in custody and
 
06:06:27.190 --> 06:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
share relevant information about
 
06:06:29.310 --> 06:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
immigration status it creates a
 
06:06:31.628 --> 06:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism for enforcement if any state
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
or local entity violates the provisions
 
06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
of this act the Attorney General is
 
06:06:37.628 --> 06:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
empowered to intervene ensuring
 
06:06:40.030 --> 06:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
accountability and adherence to the law
 
06:06:41.868 --> 06:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
now I do want to be clear about what
 
06:06:44.350 --> 06:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do it does not ask
 
06:06:46.030 --> 06:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement to take on the
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
role of immigration officers or detract
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
from their primary responsibility of
 
06:06:52.510 --> 06:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring Public Safety in their
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
communities rather it ensures that our
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
state and local agencies do not obstruct
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration enforcement critics
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
May argue against this Common Sense bill
 
06:07:04.868 --> 06:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
but I would ask who benefits when our
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
laws are not not enforced certainly not
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
the law-abiding citizens of New
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certainly not the victims of
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
crime that would have been prevented if
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
Federal authorities were able to act
 
06:07:17.948 --> 06:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is about protecting our
 
06:07:20.110 --> 06:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
communities and supporting our law
 
06:07:22.190 --> 06:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies in their mission to
 
06:07:24.548 --> 06:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
uphold the law I'd also like to point
 
06:07:27.670 --> 06:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
out that HB 511 is part of a broader
 
06:07:29.750 --> 06:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
commitment to maintaining the Safety and
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Security of our state we cannot ignore
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
the interconnected nature of law
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement in today's world
 
06:07:37.150 --> 06:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
whether we're addressing drug
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
trafficking human trafficking violent
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
crime or any other issue we rely on a
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
strong participation between local state
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
and federal agencies to keep New
 
06:07:50.070 --> 06:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire safe this bill sends a clear
 
06:07:51.910 --> 06:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
message New Hampshire stands for the
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
rule of law and we will not allow
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
policies that compromise the safety of
 
06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
our communities or undermine the ability
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement to do their jobs in
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
closing HB 511 is not about politics
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's about Public Safety
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's about ensuring that our law
 
06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies have the tools
 
06:08:11.948 --> 06:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
Clarity and support they need to protect
 
06:08:14.030 --> 06:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families I urge you to
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
consider the benefits of this
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that they will bring to our
 
06:08:20.590 --> 06:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
communities and vote to recommend HB 511
 
06:08:22.948 --> 06:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass thank you and I'm very
 
06:08:24.310 --> 06:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
06:08:25.390 --> 06:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
06:08:28.110 --> 06:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative questions
 
06:08:28.120 --> 06:08:29.708 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative questions
representative

06:08:29.708 --> 06:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you Mr
 
06:08:31.920 --> 06:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you Mr
chair

06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:08:38.030 --> 06:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
so let's assume a person uh is arrested
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
by a political Police Department uh for
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
a crime then you know misdemeanor or
 
06:08:45.468 --> 06:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
felony local police department becomes
 
06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
aware that there is a detainer out on
 
06:08:49.788 --> 06:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
that person could you name the police
 
06:08:52.270 --> 06:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
departments that you're aware of in New
 
06:08:57.548 --> 06:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that do not call uh ice I I
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
know there have been talks thank you for
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
the question representative I know there
 
06:09:02.830 --> 06:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
have been talks in the past uh some
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
communities out in Chester County have
 
06:09:06.948 --> 06:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
adopted sanctuary policies uh and there
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
is a sanctuary policy agreement with the
 
06:09:11.390 --> 06:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County
 
06:09:16.270 --> 06:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections follow up um I want
 
06:09:20.430 --> 06:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
to talk I want to not use not ask
 
06:09:22.510 --> 06:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions about Sanctuary policies
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
because that that's a big umbrella of
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
possible policies what I'm interested in
 
06:09:29.830 --> 06:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
is do you know of any jurisdictions who
 
06:09:31.468 --> 06:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
when a person has been arrested for a
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
crime and they become aware that there's
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
a a federal immigration container out
 
06:09:38.430 --> 06:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
that that either that police department
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
or that household correction has not
 
06:09:45.310 --> 06:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
called ice I in hearing your question I
 
06:09:47.430 --> 06:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
think it's an impossible one to answer
 
06:09:49.270 --> 06:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
because if that police department does
 
06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
not cooperate with ice we would not know
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
about the lack of cooperation if they
 
06:09:55.468 --> 06:09:55.478 align:start position:0%
were to pick somebody up that has an
 
06:09:57.868 --> 06:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer
 
06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
followup um so I want to make a
 
06:10:04.430 --> 06:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
distinction between an individual who
 
06:10:06.990 --> 06:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
has a f Federal detainer immigration
 
06:10:10.150 --> 06:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
detainer out but who hasn't committed a
 
06:10:12.468 --> 06:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
crime right well if they're in the
 
06:10:13.990 --> 06:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
country illegally they've committed a
 
06:10:16.948 --> 06:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
crime no let me let me finish my
 
06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
question understanding that it is not a
 
06:10:22.590 --> 06:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
federal crime to be undocumented in the
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
United States it's a federal crime to
 
06:10:26.708 --> 06:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
cross the border when you're
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
undocumented it's not a federal crime to
 
06:10:31.868 --> 06:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
be to be president in the United States
 
06:10:35.590 --> 06:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
and be undocumented given that uh when
 
06:10:39.788 --> 06:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
there is a detainer uh uh immigration
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
detainer on somebody who has not
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
been uh is not charged with a State
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
Crime do you think does this bill apply
 
06:10:54.468 --> 06:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
to that person or does it only apply to
 
06:10:57.070 --> 06:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who's in custody of the uh of a
 
06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
local facility be or the police as I
 
06:11:01.868 --> 06:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
said in my testimony this does not
 
06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
direct local New Hampshire law
 
06:11:04.830 --> 06:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the local level or the
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
state level to become immigration
 
06:11:09.030 --> 06:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
enforcers uh it simply directs them to
 
06:11:12.070 --> 06:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
cooperate with ice in their activities
 
06:11:13.948 --> 06:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't be you know local
 
06:11:15.390 --> 06:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
police officers wouldn't be going out
 
06:11:18.830 --> 06:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
into communities to find uh those that
 
06:11:21.548 --> 06:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
are here illegally uh those illegal
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
aliens that are here it will just they
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
will be working with ice when they do
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody for other crimes as you
 
06:11:29.110 --> 06:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
as you reference but it's not going
 
06:11:31.030 --> 06:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to proactively go out
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
because of this bill uh to to go out
 
06:11:36.468 --> 06:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
that will be the Federal ice Department
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
job and I appreciate that answer one
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
final follow-up question um so uh in
 
06:11:47.548 --> 06:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
looking at uh in looking at um HB 511 uh
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a a copy in front of you uh
 
06:11:52.110 --> 06:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
I I have my testimony but I I know the
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
copy in my head um so uh what I'm
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
referring to for members of the
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee on uh uh on go I can find the
 
06:12:07.628 --> 06:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
bill on uh page two uh line
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
32 where it
 
06:12:09.840 --> 06:12:11.750 align:start position:0%
32 where it
reads

06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
reads
 
06:12:14.390 --> 06:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh accept as otherwise authorized the
 
06:12:16.390 --> 06:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
state entity Etc may not prohibit or in
 
06:12:18.628 --> 06:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
any way restrict a law enforcement
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
agency from taking any of the following
 
06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
actions with re respect to information
 
06:12:26.590 --> 06:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
regarding a person's immigration status
 
06:12:28.468 --> 06:12:28.478 align:start position:0%
if we were to change that to reflect
 
06:12:30.510 --> 06:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
what the conversation we've just had to
 
06:12:32.750 --> 06:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
read instead to take the any of the
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
following actions with respect to
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
information regarding an inmate's uh
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
immigration status uh would you be fine
 
06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
with that no I I like the wording as is
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the person it still doesn't direct
 
06:12:47.230 --> 06:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement agencies to go out
 
06:12:49.230 --> 06:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
and enforce the immigration laws but I
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
don't see why we would put further
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
handcuffs on law enforcement and their
 
06:13:02.430 --> 06:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
authorities uh thank you for taking my
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
question are you uh familiar with the
 
06:13:10.350 --> 06:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
lakan Riley act that was recently passed
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
by Congress I I am and I applaud its
 
06:13:15.468 --> 06:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
passage how would that work with this
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
bill if it were to become law well
 
06:13:20.750 --> 06:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
simply any new especially the lake and
 
06:13:23.310 --> 06:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
Riley act or any new legislation or laws
 
06:13:25.110 --> 06:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
that come out of the federal government
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampsh New Hampshire local law
 
06:13:28.830 --> 06:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement state law enforcement would
 
06:13:30.590 --> 06:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
be obliged to work with Federal
 
06:13:32.830 --> 06:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
immigration officials to enforce those
 
06:13:39.430 --> 06:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
you I have a question um representative
 
06:13:45.070 --> 06:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
last year this bill or a version of this
 
06:13:48.190 --> 06:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill um came before us and we we ended
 
06:13:51.070 --> 06:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
up amending it a little bit um because
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that it was a
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
little too broad as far as the portion
 
06:13:58.868 --> 06:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
that says they um will let me see where
 
06:14:02.310 --> 06:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
I can find it that that they will do any
 
06:14:06.548 --> 06:14:06.558 align:start position:0%
their best efforts um we we we changed
 
06:14:08.590 --> 06:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
that a little bit to narrow it down if I
 
06:14:11.548 --> 06:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
recall and it said to the extent
 
06:14:14.150 --> 06:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
possible and their ability to safely do
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
so shall comply with immigration detain
 
06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
is discovered during the investigation
 
06:14:20.670 --> 06:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
of a violation of New Hampshire law um
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
that was to make sure that it was not
 
06:14:26.468 --> 06:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
deemed to be them becoming federal
 
06:14:27.910 --> 06:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
police officers but if they were
 
06:14:29.708 --> 06:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
investigating in the Hampshire crime and
 
06:14:31.830 --> 06:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
they became aware of this then they had
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
to follow it um what are your thoughts
 
06:14:36.270 --> 06:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
on that uh you know humbly I'm I'm one
 
06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
of 400 and it's now the committee's bill
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
after I've introduced it so please feel
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
free to to have discussions among the
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee but that does not seem like a
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
change I would oppose okay thank you and
 
06:14:49.070 --> 06:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't change the the the sentiment
 
06:14:51.468 --> 06:14:51.478 align:start position:0%
of the bill it would just um narrow it
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
so that we focus on exactly what we were
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
interested in nothing more um further
 
06:14:58.868 --> 06:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.230 --> 06:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
Muse have you reviewed the text of this
 
06:15:03.150 --> 06:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
bill with anyone in law enforcement and
 
06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
if you have what kind of feedback have
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
you got but I'm not thank
 
06:15:11.110 --> 06:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:15:13.230 --> 06:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
new thank you and thank you for taking
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
my question um I we've heard a lot today
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
about um sex trafficking and and the
 
06:15:21.548 --> 06:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
need to really address that and one of
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
the things that was um noted was that
 
06:15:28.030 --> 06:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes people's um undocumented
 
06:15:31.948 --> 06:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
status is uh a reason why they are not
 
06:15:34.468 --> 06:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
um willing to speak up for themselves
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
people who are victims in that situation
 
06:15:39.150 --> 06:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that um bills like
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
this might hinder people I I actually
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
come from one of the um towns in in
 
06:15:46.110 --> 06:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
chesher County who has actually what
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's called as a welcoming uh it's a a
 
06:15:51.468 --> 06:15:51.478 align:start position:0%
welcome I'm blanking on what it is but
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
welcome uh city um Proclamation um and
 
06:15:57.708 --> 06:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
what it says is that we just won't
 
06:16:00.350 --> 06:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um address and what we
 
06:16:03.510 --> 06:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
have found um the reason why we did that
 
06:16:06.350 --> 06:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
is because uh it it made it so that we
 
06:16:08.910 --> 06:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
could uh that we could actually fight
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
crime better because we had open
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
communication right it allows for open
 
06:16:15.468 --> 06:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
communication so this is a situation
 
06:16:16.750 --> 06:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about today
 
06:16:18.990 --> 06:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
around sex trafficking and and this
 
06:16:21.310 --> 06:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
among other uh criminal behavior is
 
06:16:24.548 --> 06:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
hindered by people's inability uh or you
 
06:16:26.190 --> 06:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
know the perceived inability to be able
 
06:16:27.788 --> 06:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
to speak with police if they believe
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they will be removed from the
 
06:16:31.190 --> 06:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
country that type of situation are you
 
06:16:35.590 --> 06:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about inhibiting um um law
 
06:16:37.868 --> 06:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement from addressing crime
 
06:16:39.788 --> 06:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
because they cannot have open lines of
 
06:16:42.910 --> 06:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
communication with people um with an
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented status I I appreciate the
 
06:16:46.830 --> 06:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
question I certainly appreciate the
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
sensitivity of the question I truly
 
06:16:51.788 --> 06:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
believe that under this bill law
 
06:16:53.430 --> 06:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the local and the state
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
level will be able to work to prevent
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
further crimes from taking place that
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
sunlight is the best disinfectant and
 
06:17:01.948 --> 06:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
that this will give them the tools not
 
06:17:04.110 --> 06:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
handcuff our law enforcement from not
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
being able to enforce the law uh and be
 
06:17:08.670 --> 06:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
able to work with Federal authorities so
 
06:17:10.788 --> 06:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we can actually tackle uh human
 
06:17:12.670 --> 06:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
trafficking at the source which is our
 
06:17:15.468 --> 06:17:15.478 align:start position:0%
right now mainly our Southern border um
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I think as we just continue to have
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation on immigration more
 
06:17:21.150 --> 06:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement not less will lead to less
 
06:17:21.160 --> 06:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement not less will lead to less
human

06:17:21.990 --> 06:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
human
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
trafficking thank
 
06:17:26.910 --> 06:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
you see you no further questions thank
 
06:17:32.430 --> 06:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:35.708 --> 06:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
much just so everyone um is aware we
 
06:17:37.628 --> 06:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
only have until 5:00 to get out of the
 
06:17:39.548 --> 06:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
building so I would ask you to please
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
keep your testimony piffy if you might
 
06:17:44.750 --> 06:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and non-repetitive I'm not going to

We're a nation of laws and every country
 
06:28:09.350 --> 06:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the world has borders and they
 
06:28:10.750 --> 06:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
protect their
 
06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
borders I've been to the Border
 
06:28:15.468 --> 06:28:15.478 align:start position:0%

06:28:21.670 --> 06:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
ranchers I saw the cages that were built
 
06:28:23.628 --> 06:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
under the abama
 
06:28:25.390 --> 06:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
administration but we were not allowed
 
06:28:27.708 --> 06:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
to see the children but I can tell from
 
06:28:29.510 --> 06:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
my conversations with them that they
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
they they cared about those children and
 
06:28:32.590 --> 06:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
they was assured that they take care of
 
06:28:33.868 --> 06:28:33.878 align:start position:0%

than

06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman members of
 
06:29:57.430 --> 06:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is yil Binet I'm
 
06:29:58.910 --> 06:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
the legal director at the
 
06:30:02.030 --> 06:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
ACLU uh of New Hampshire and we are here
 
06:30:06.270 --> 06:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB 511 I know that we
 
06:30:07.670 --> 06:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
only have half an hour and I'm
 
06:30:09.548 --> 06:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
respectful of the committee's time and
 
06:30:11.350 --> 06:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the time of folks behind me who
 
06:30:12.590 --> 06:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
haven't yet spoken so I just want to
 
06:30:15.070 --> 06:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
make a few points real quick about this
 
06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
bill and I think first is with respect
 
06:30:20.030 --> 06:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
to uh the statement made um about the
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor that this isn't going to commere
 
06:30:24.430 --> 06:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just summarizing but this isn't
 
06:30:27.030 --> 06:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to commere local police department
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
resources and I I just don't agree with
 
06:30:32.270 --> 06:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
that based on the text um of the bill
 
06:30:34.510 --> 06:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to flag that because the
 
06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is very Broad and I
 
06:30:39.548 --> 06:30:39.558 align:start position:0%
do think is phrased as a mandate with
 
06:30:41.548 --> 06:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
respect to what our local police have to
 
06:30:45.030 --> 06:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
do right so for example no uh government
 
06:30:47.110 --> 06:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
entity shall quote knowingly enact issue
 
06:30:49.788 --> 06:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
adop promulgate enforce Etc any
 
06:30:51.990 --> 06:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policy with that policy being
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
defined broadly with respect to detainer
 
06:30:58.150 --> 06:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
compliance and the bill for also two
 
06:31:00.990 --> 06:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
goes so far of course to state that law
 
06:31:03.910 --> 06:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement must use best efforts to
 
06:31:05.468 --> 06:31:05.478 align:start position:0%
support the enforcement of federal
 
06:31:06.788 --> 06:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
immigration law and I think when you
 
06:31:08.388 --> 06:31:08.398 align:start position:0%
look at kind of all those Provisions
 
06:31:10.628 --> 06:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
together particularly when you also look
 
06:31:13.110 --> 06:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
at the penalties that are attached to
 
06:31:14.708 --> 06:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
non-compliance I think what you have is
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
a mandate for local police to do the
 
06:31:19.510 --> 06:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
work of federal immigration enforcement
 
06:31:21.708 --> 06:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
I think really commanders our local
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
police um whose jobs are not to enforce
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
federal civil immigration laws but to
 
06:31:29.868 --> 06:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
enforce state and federal crimes and
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
those are very different things in fact
 
06:31:32.990 --> 06:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
and that gets to my second point with
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
respect to mandating uh compliance with
 
06:31:39.230 --> 06:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
detainers detainer is a request uh
 
06:31:41.468 --> 06:31:41.478 align:start position:0%
that's all it is a request by federal
 
06:31:44.190 --> 06:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement for local and
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
County officials to hold someone for ice
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
for up to 48 hours and so there just by
 
06:31:51.590 --> 06:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
its terms if you mandate
 
06:31:54.830 --> 06:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with that detainer um you are
 
06:31:56.430 --> 06:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're effectively commandeering the
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
resources of local police and that's not
 
06:32:00.670 --> 06:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
just we're not talking here I want to be
 
06:32:04.830 --> 06:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
very clear about state or federal crimes
 
06:32:06.548 --> 06:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about civil immigration
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
violations as a uh representative sure
 
06:32:11.590 --> 06:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned before being undocumented by
 
06:32:14.548 --> 06:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
itself is not a crime that is different
 
06:32:17.070 --> 06:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
from though right if someone knowingly
 
06:32:18.990 --> 06:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
crosses the Border whether it's a
 
06:32:20.548 --> 06:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
northern border or the southern border
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
that is a crime but being undocumented
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
by itself is not it is a civil
 
06:32:26.310 --> 06:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
immigration violation so when you
 
06:32:29.070 --> 06:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
require local police to hold people on
 
06:32:30.990 --> 06:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
civil immigration violations it also
 
06:32:32.990 --> 06:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
creates constitutional concerns right
 
06:32:35.670 --> 06:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
because there's no indicia that a crime
 
06:32:37.150 --> 06:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
has actually been committed yet you're
 
06:32:39.468 --> 06:32:39.478 align:start position:0%
requiring our local law enforcement to
 
06:32:42.388 --> 06:32:42.398 align:start position:0%
hold those individuals lastly and this
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
is another reason why law enforcement
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
have opposed last year opposed ident an
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
identical Bill and I've attached that
 
06:32:52.590 --> 06:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
letter to my testimony is that when you
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
ask local law enforcement to do federal
 
06:32:58.350 --> 06:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement again for civil
 
06:33:00.868 --> 06:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
immigration violations separate and
 
06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
apart we're not talking about crimes if
 
06:33:04.190 --> 06:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
you commit a crime there's no sanctuary
 
06:33:05.548 --> 06:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right you should be
 
06:33:07.590 --> 06:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
arrested and prosecuted but when you
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
require local police to do civil
 
06:33:12.750 --> 06:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
immigration violation enforcement you
 
06:33:14.868 --> 06:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
create real concerns that community
 
06:33:17.788 --> 06:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
members immigrants won't go to police
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
for help won't go to police if they're a
 
06:33:22.750 --> 06:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
victim won go to police to be a witness
 
06:33:24.510 --> 06:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
or to report a crime and that's one of
 
06:33:28.270 --> 06:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
the many reasons why law enforcement um
 
06:33:30.350 --> 06:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know have have raised concerns about
 
06:33:32.830 --> 06:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
these types uh of legislation so with
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
that I'll just
 
06:33:36.590 --> 06:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
rest on what I've submitted uh to the
 
06:33:37.868 --> 06:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
committee and I want to express my
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
gratitude and appreciation for
 
06:33:41.830 --> 06:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
consideration uh of our concerns which
 
06:33:44.430 --> 06:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
we think are are profoundly uh
 
06:33:45.910 --> 06:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
problematic with respect to this bill
 
06:33:48.388 --> 06:33:48.398 align:start position:0%
and we'd ask that this bill be itl thank
 
06:33:52.230 --> 06:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you um if it's any consolation
 
06:33:54.110 --> 06:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
I've requested an amendment so that it
 
06:33:56.190 --> 06:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
matches the bill that we actually went
 
06:33:57.708 --> 06:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
to Florida the Roy Amendment last year
 
06:34:00.388 --> 06:34:00.398 align:start position:0%
yes I thought that might be happening
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I realize you may not support
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
that whole but I think you found it much
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
more palatable do you want me to respond
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
to that or or just
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
feele um you know I think it goes
 
06:34:13.548 --> 06:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
without saying we did have concerns with
 
06:34:15.590 --> 06:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
that Amendment it did take out the best
 
06:34:17.670 --> 06:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
efforts language which I want to express
 
06:34:19.110 --> 06:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
my gratitude for the chair for doing
 
06:34:21.628 --> 06:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
that because I do think that is deeply
 
06:34:24.590 --> 06:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
problematic language but my recollection
 
06:34:25.990 --> 06:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
of that amendment is that it it
 
06:34:28.628 --> 06:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
continued to have um some detainer
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
compliance language in it that we had
 
06:34:33.990 --> 06:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
issu issues with um for all the Reon I
 
06:34:35.948 --> 06:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
just said but in addition Our concern
 
06:34:37.590 --> 06:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
with detainers is that there's no baked
 
06:34:40.150 --> 06:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
in due process associated with them and
 
06:34:41.670 --> 06:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
so we would continue to have those
 
06:34:43.990 --> 06:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
concerns which I know is no surprise Mr
 
06:34:46.230 --> 06:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you uh
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative PR has a question if you
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't mind of course of course kind of
 
06:34:53.788 --> 06:34:53.798 align:start position:0%
confused happens to me a lot it does so
 
06:34:56.948 --> 06:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
how can you be undocumented in this
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
country without knowingly crossing a
 
06:35:03.388 --> 06:35:03.398 align:start position:0%
border oh it happens all the time and
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's that happens through Visa
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
overstays which is actually the kind of
 
06:35:10.110 --> 06:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
highest category of undocumented
 
06:35:14.230 --> 06:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
individuals in fact um it is a minority
 
06:35:16.310 --> 06:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
of undocumented individuals who are just
 
06:35:18.230 --> 06:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
crossing the New Hampshire or New Mexico
 
06:35:20.628 --> 06:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
border without authorization most occur
 
06:35:22.030 --> 06:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
through individuals who've actually
 
06:35:24.110 --> 06:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
entered the country lawfully through a
 
06:35:27.150 --> 06:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
Visa and then overstay that by itself is
 
06:35:29.230 --> 06:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
not a federal crime though it is a
 
06:35:31.868 --> 06:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
federal civil immigration violation and
 
06:35:34.990 --> 06:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
that distinction I think is material for
 
06:35:38.070 --> 06:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
um the custody custody issues that I
 
06:35:40.708 --> 06:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
raised in my testimony to be clear
 
06:35:43.910 --> 06:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
though a second subsequent entry without
 
06:35:46.030 --> 06:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
being documented is a federal crime is
 
06:35:48.430 --> 06:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
if you cross the border yes yes that is
 
06:35:49.868 --> 06:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
that is correct I'm not disputing that
 
06:35:51.948 --> 06:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
at all Mr chairman has has the Supreme
 
06:35:53.708 --> 06:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
Court at all come down on this this
 
06:35:58.388 --> 06:35:58.398 align:start position:0%
issue of detainers um no no there's
 
06:36:01.270 --> 06:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple other federal courts
 
06:36:03.150 --> 06:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
not at the Supreme Court level that have
 
06:36:04.548 --> 06:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
AAL waed
 
06:36:07.310 --> 06:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
to is there a circuit split you know I I
 
06:36:09.070 --> 06:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't think so um I mean that's
 
06:36:11.670 --> 06:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
something I can I can I can evaluate I I
 
06:36:13.590 --> 06:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
we I know site in our testimony a lot of
 
06:36:15.628 --> 06:36:15.638 align:start position:0%
the federal courts that have looked at
 
06:36:16.910 --> 06:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
detainers and have expressed some
 
06:36:18.590 --> 06:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to detention to
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
detention purely on um detainers so
 
06:36:22.200 --> 06:36:26.590 align:start position:0%
detention purely on um detainers so
thank

06:36:26.590 --> 06:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:29.350 --> 06:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
you um we have to leave at 5: so please
 
06:36:34.430 --> 06:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:36.910 --> 06:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
the the environment uh for this bill is
 
06:36:38.670 --> 06:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than the one in
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
2024 uh the fiscal note is basically the
 
06:36:46.310 --> 06:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
same uh my my question is is what impact
 
06:36:48.948 --> 06:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
will the federal changes in Immigration
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
policy that have been announced over the
 
06:36:54.430 --> 06:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
last couple of days and that also are
 
06:36:58.070 --> 06:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
are being uh contemplated in Washington
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
DC what will that what impact will that
 
06:37:03.270 --> 06:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
have on on the number of detainers that
 
06:37:06.750 --> 06:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
are out there and the requirements on
 
06:37:08.590 --> 06:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and local police is there
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
any way to estimate that at this point
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great question I I I don't
 
06:37:15.708 --> 06:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
know I have some guesses but I I'm
 
06:37:17.468 --> 06:37:17.478 align:start position:0%
always hesitant to guess you know being
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
a lawyer I think we probably can I think
 
06:37:22.430 --> 06:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably safe to say we're going to
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
see increased use of detainers and these
 
06:37:27.270 --> 06:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
documents being funnel to loc and law
 
06:37:29.468 --> 06:37:29.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement to ask local law enforcement
 
06:37:33.628 --> 06:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
to do detentions with local resources if
 
06:37:35.430 --> 06:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
that assumption is true then the
 
06:37:37.030 --> 06:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've raised would be even
 
06:37:38.670 --> 06:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
more pronounced because they would
 
06:37:38.680 --> 06:37:39.750 align:start position:0%
more pronounced because they would
require

06:37:39.750 --> 06:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
06:37:42.190 --> 06:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
local you know local talented
 
06:37:45.230 --> 06:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
communities to pay for those detentions
 
06:37:47.388 --> 06:37:47.398 align:start position:0%
for the the two days up to two days that
 
06:37:49.388 --> 06:37:49.398 align:start position:0%
they'd be authorized under under a
 
06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
detainer thank you thank
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
you represent Newman this is just one
 
06:37:57.708 --> 06:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
more thing about whether you're illegal
 
06:38:00.430 --> 06:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
in this country without papers yes cross
 
06:38:02.350 --> 06:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
the border and you're in the country
 
06:38:04.868 --> 06:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
just by not having
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
papers what what are your comments about
 
06:38:08.750 --> 06:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's due process or whether
 
06:38:10.548 --> 06:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
you are in fact illegal and even if you
 
06:38:12.230 --> 06:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
come in on like a Visa you explained
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
that one y but if you came in and then
 
06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
you cross the border illegally just are
 
06:38:18.868 --> 06:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
they illegal or not just because they
 
06:38:22.110 --> 06:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
have committed a crime and nothing else
 
06:38:24.150 --> 06:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
the guy's just standing there and he may
 
06:38:26.548 --> 06:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
have crossed the border yeah I could
 
06:38:28.468 --> 06:38:28.478 align:start position:0%
only speak legally because that's my
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
training and I think that is the most
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
accurate way to talk about
 
06:38:35.948 --> 06:38:35.958 align:start position:0%
um how to categorize certain groups of
 
06:38:37.628 --> 06:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
individuals so I think saying some
 
06:38:39.548 --> 06:38:39.558 align:start position:0%
someone is illegal or not is not an
 
06:38:42.030 --> 06:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
accurate reflection of someone's status
 
06:38:44.510 --> 06:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
you have individuals that have committed
 
06:38:46.708 --> 06:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
federal crimes by being in the United
 
06:38:48.670 --> 06:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
States what I mean by that is they have
 
06:38:50.830 --> 06:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
crossed the border once or maybe twice
 
06:38:54.350 --> 06:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
without authorization which is a crime
 
06:38:56.468 --> 06:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
or you have individuals who cross the
 
06:38:58.230 --> 06:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
border they had lawful authority to
 
06:38:59.590 --> 06:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
cross the border and this is most
 
06:39:01.868 --> 06:39:01.878 align:start position:0%
instances by the way they've overstate a
 
06:39:04.628 --> 06:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
Visa by some way shape or form they are
 
06:39:06.230 --> 06:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
not here lawfully but they haven't
 
06:39:07.948 --> 06:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
committed a crime they've committed a
 
06:39:10.030 --> 06:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
civil immigration violation I think
 
06:39:13.708 --> 06:39:13.718 align:start position:0%
those are accurate descriptors for those
 
06:39:14.948 --> 06:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
those groups and individuals and that
 
06:39:16.948 --> 06:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
becomes meaningful here with respect to
 
06:39:19.430 --> 06:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
what the authority is for local police
 
06:39:22.350 --> 06:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
to detain someone if there's a crime yes
 
06:39:25.070 --> 06:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
if there isn't cons constitutional
 
06:39:27.468 --> 06:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you to the best your
 
06:39:28.990 --> 06:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge are there different types of
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
detainers are there criminal detainers
 
06:39:32.990 --> 06:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
versus civil detainers I I'm I'm only
 
06:39:35.590 --> 06:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the the detainer form which I
 
06:39:38.388 --> 06:39:38.398 align:start position:0%
think is principally used for just
 
06:39:40.350 --> 06:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
anyone that's undocumented so it could
 
06:39:43.430 --> 06:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
be I suppose it could be someone who's
 
06:39:45.310 --> 06:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
crossed without authorization no but I
 
06:39:47.150 --> 06:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
mean someone who perhaps is wanted for
 
06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
murder um well if they're wanted for
 
06:39:51.750 --> 06:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
murder and they haven't Ser they haven't
 
06:39:53.628 --> 06:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
been arrested or served their sentence
 
06:39:55.110 --> 06:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
they should be arrested they will be
 
06:39:56.548 --> 06:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
arrested would that be reflected on the
 
06:39:59.468 --> 06:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
detainer form no but that the detainer
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
usually comes in in that instance after
 
06:40:04.468 --> 06:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
someone is actually served D their
 
06:40:06.190 --> 06:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
sentence so they'd be a criminal War
 
06:40:07.910 --> 06:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so that so that person will that
 
06:40:09.990 --> 06:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
person the murder in that example that
 
06:40:11.270 --> 06:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
person would have been adjudicated for
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
murder would have been arrested
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
prosecuted as they should right what
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are individuals who
 
06:40:20.388 --> 06:40:20.398 align:start position:0%
haven't committed crimes um you know who
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
visa overstate and whether or not
 
06:40:24.590 --> 06:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's authority to to hold them and
 
06:40:27.548 --> 06:40:27.558 align:start position:0%
require local police to use their
 
06:40:28.990 --> 06:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
resources to hold them and that's where
 
06:40:30.708 --> 06:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
we have concerns thank you
 
06:40:30.718 --> 06:40:31.788 align:start position:0%
we have concerns thank you

former student of mine um I'm looking at
 
06:40:45.310 --> 06:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh page
 
06:40:50.030 --> 06:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:53.110 --> 06:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
32 thank you we ran out of copies I'm
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
sorry fa enough you very much page two
 
06:40:57.750 --> 06:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
line 32 yeah and that that that that
 
06:41:00.110 --> 06:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
reads I asked uh representative Sweeny
 
06:41:04.910 --> 06:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
this question uh to preface that State
 
06:41:07.468 --> 06:41:07.478 align:start position:0%
entity may not prohibit or in any way
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
restrict a law enforcement agency from
 
06:41:11.750 --> 06:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
taking any of the following actions with
 
06:41:13.708 --> 06:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
respect to information regarding a
 
06:41:16.708 --> 06:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
person's immigration status now let's go
 
06:41:18.430 --> 06:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
back to what you said there are civil
 
06:41:20.868 --> 06:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
detainers somebody hasn't been charged
 
06:41:23.310 --> 06:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
in the state with a crime there's just a
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
civil detainer um and there the other
 
06:41:28.948 --> 06:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
group is people who've been charged with
 
06:41:31.230 --> 06:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
the crime the police department is aware
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
that there is a detainer uh
 
06:41:40.150 --> 06:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh if we CH and and my understanding is
 
06:41:44.868 --> 06:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
some many people's desire is to have
 
06:41:48.430 --> 06:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
police departments go ahead and call ICE
 
06:41:50.150 --> 06:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
when a person's charged with a crime and
 
06:41:51.628 --> 06:41:51.638 align:start position:0%
they know they have a detainer and let
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
them know that they have the person in
 
06:41:56.590 --> 06:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
custody if we were to change the word a
 
06:42:00.910 --> 06:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
persons into an inmates so and an inmate
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
is previously defined as somebody in
 
06:42:02.798 --> 06:42:03.948 align:start position:0%
is previously defined as somebody in
custody

06:42:03.948 --> 06:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
custody
 
06:42:07.190 --> 06:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh in some fashion uh would you be
 
06:42:10.190 --> 06:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that change to narrow
 
06:42:11.868 --> 06:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
down what this bill is it paying
 
06:42:13.388 --> 06:42:13.398 align:start position:0%
attention to I think that would be much
 
06:42:14.990 --> 06:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
more palatable and I I want to just kind
 
06:42:17.628 --> 06:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
of give two reasons for that first
 
06:42:20.310 --> 06:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're cabining the kind of Ambit of
 
06:42:23.670 --> 06:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
this bill to not individuals who are out
 
06:42:25.310 --> 06:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
on the street or driving you're cabining
 
06:42:27.230 --> 06:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
it to individuals who are already
 
06:42:29.510 --> 06:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
detained in some way shape or form I
 
06:42:30.590 --> 06:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:42:34.750 --> 06:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
is um would narrow it in ways that are
 
06:42:36.190 --> 06:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
helpful I I think I would still want to
 
06:42:37.388 --> 06:42:37.398 align:start position:0%
think a little bit more about it but I
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
think that would be a favorable change
 
06:42:41.230 --> 06:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
and in addition if we're not talking
 
06:42:43.830 --> 06:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
about detention but we're talking about
 
06:42:46.830 --> 06:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
just uh local law enforcement or a local
 
06:42:48.708 --> 06:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
governing body just providing the
 
06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
information um that's not as much of a
 
06:42:54.510 --> 06:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
burden obviously on them um and I would
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
be maybe maybe still concerned but far
 
06:43:00.750 --> 06:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
less concerned um with that I also think
 
06:43:03.190 --> 06:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
that like happens pretty regularly um I
 
06:43:04.990 --> 06:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
could tell you like I'm pretty sure
 
06:43:07.310 --> 06:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
County jails do that regularly as much
 
06:43:10.110 --> 06:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
as I may like that or not so if you
 
06:43:12.110 --> 06:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to memorialize that to say you
 
06:43:14.548 --> 06:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
know we think you should do that that is
 
06:43:16.590 --> 06:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
far better than saying you also need to
 
06:43:19.388 --> 06:43:19.398 align:start position:0%
hold them for ice you need to stop them
 
06:43:21.468 --> 06:43:21.478 align:start position:0%
you need to detain them you know I think
 
06:43:23.150 --> 06:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
that that is more dramatic of an
 
06:43:25.190 --> 06:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
intrusion and I think that that more
 
06:43:27.310 --> 06:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
dramatic intrusion is reflected in in
 
06:43:28.750 --> 06:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
the current version of this Bill thank
 
06:43:30.590 --> 06:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
you my understanding is uh that's the
 
06:43:31.948 --> 06:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
policy of the Portsmouth Police
 
06:43:34.070 --> 06:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
Department I believe also the policy the
 
06:43:37.590 --> 06:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department uh to to uh
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
call when they've arrested someone they
 
06:43:41.830 --> 06:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
know there's a detainer yeah absolutely
 
06:43:43.070 --> 06:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you agree because that's what
 
06:43:45.628 --> 06:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment does um well I think oh
 
06:43:46.948 --> 06:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment does more than that can I
 
06:43:49.910 --> 06:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
respond it does that as well I I it does
 
06:43:51.948 --> 06:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
that as well exactly but I think it goes
 
06:43:53.948 --> 06:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
beyond that I'm sorry to to be difficult
 
06:43:57.468 --> 06:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm I heard you um all right
 
06:43:58.910 --> 06:43:58.920 align:start position:0%

here in the state of New Hampshire if
 
06:46:12.910 --> 06:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
enacted HB 511 will prohibit
 
06:46:15.150 --> 06:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from employing dangerous
 
06:46:17.910 --> 06:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies that provide a safe
 
06:46:20.230 --> 06:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
haven in which illegal aliens can work
 
06:46:22.548 --> 06:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
and live without fear of apprehension by
 
06:46:24.150 --> 06:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
federal immigration
 
06:46:26.388 --> 06:46:26.398 align:start position:0%
authorities I just want to kind of touch
 
06:46:28.468 --> 06:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
on some of the points that were raised
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
before um I'm not saying everyone who
 
06:46:35.030 --> 06:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
comes here is a criminal alien uh what
 
06:46:37.150 --> 06:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that individuals who
 
06:46:39.150 --> 06:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
enter through our back door and not our
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
front door have not been vetted and
 
06:46:43.788 --> 06:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
their intentions are unknown even those
 
06:46:45.510 --> 06:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
who have entered legally such as
 
06:46:47.868 --> 06:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
students or tourists and overstay their
 
06:46:49.910 --> 06:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
visas remaining in this United States
 
06:46:52.388 --> 06:46:52.398 align:start position:0%
illegally have not had the same thorough
 
06:46:54.990 --> 06:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
background that is performed by someone
 
06:46:57.670 --> 06:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
who is legally immigrating to the United
 
06:47:01.628 --> 06:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
States um I just want to clearly state
 
06:47:03.788 --> 06:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
that just in the last fiscal year there
 
06:47:07.150 --> 06:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
were 410 individuals who were on the
 
06:47:08.948 --> 06:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
terrorist watch list that were
 
06:47:12.270 --> 06:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
encountered at our Northern borders and
 
06:47:13.868 --> 06:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
an additional three that were
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
encountered between the ports of Entry
 
06:47:18.270 --> 06:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
just to highlight that we don't know
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
who's coming
 
06:47:22.750 --> 06:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
in sanctuary policies come in all shapes
 
06:47:25.750 --> 06:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
and sizes as you've heard some are
 
06:47:28.150 --> 06:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
written some are not some are enacted
 
06:47:30.350 --> 06:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
through local laws while some are
 
06:47:33.510 --> 06:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
welcoming resolutions generally they bar
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
state and local officials including law
 
06:47:39.190 --> 06:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement from asking lawfully stopped
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
or detained individuals about their
 
06:47:44.230 --> 06:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
immigration status and from reporting or
 
06:47:45.830 --> 06:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise cooperating with Federal
 
06:47:48.150 --> 06:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
immigration officials regardless of how
 
06:47:51.548 --> 06:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
they're adopted and what form they take
 
06:47:54.868 --> 06:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
they are Sanctuary policies there are
 
06:47:57.628 --> 06:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
several in New Hampshire that um there
 
06:47:59.788 --> 06:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
have been a proliferation of counties
 
06:48:02.990 --> 06:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
Chester County Deerfield Dublin Durham
 
06:48:05.910 --> 06:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hanover Harrisonville Lebanon lime and
 
06:48:07.910 --> 06:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester they don't call themselves
 
06:48:10.510 --> 06:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary yet their practices make them
 
06:48:13.708 --> 06:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
function as sanctuary cities a question
 
06:48:16.910 --> 06:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
was raised about whether there are any
 
06:48:20.430 --> 06:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh law enforcement policies against um
 
06:48:25.110 --> 06:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
against detainers Hillsboro um County uh
 
06:48:27.670 --> 06:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
Correction Facility actually does have a
 
06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
policy that um does not cooperate with
 
06:48:34.110 --> 06:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
detainers um one of the things that was
 
06:48:38.628 --> 06:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
raised was the issue of whether it will
 
06:48:42.350 --> 06:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the reporting of crimes and
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
having people come forward about being
 
06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
criminalized besides the fact that
 
06:48:50.750 --> 06:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous tips can be given um a number
 
06:48:52.910 --> 06:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
of programs allow state and local police
 
06:48:55.070 --> 06:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
to encourage victim and witness
 
06:48:58.868 --> 06:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
cooperation by granting lawful status to
 
06:49:00.910 --> 06:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens who Aid in the
 
06:49:03.628 --> 06:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
prosecution of criminals if they provide
 
06:49:06.310 --> 06:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
helpful IM uh information to the police
 
06:49:09.670 --> 06:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
they can qualify for a UTS or vawa
 
06:49:12.270 --> 06:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
non-immigrant VISA which ultimately
 
06:49:14.788 --> 06:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
allows them to apply for permanent legal
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
status in the United States Sanctuary
 
06:49:20.750 --> 06:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
policies actually prevent illegal aliens
 
06:49:24.070 --> 06:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
victims of crime from taking advantage
 
06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
of these types of programs in addition
 
06:49:28.948 --> 06:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
there was a recent study by the center
 
06:49:31.510 --> 06:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
for immigration studies that looked at
 
06:49:32.868 --> 06:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
the data from the Department of
 
06:49:35.150 --> 06:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
Justice's National crime victim
 
06:49:37.510 --> 06:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
victimization survey and it shows that
 
06:49:40.270 --> 06:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
immigrant victimizations are just as
 
06:49:43.070 --> 06:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
likely in some cases more likely to be
 
06:49:44.830 --> 06:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
reported to the police than against the
 
06:49:44.840 --> 06:49:46.230 align:start position:0%
reported to the police than against the
native

06:49:46.230 --> 06:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
native
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
form uh one of the things that I would
 
06:49:54.788 --> 06:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
like to say is um detainers are issued
 
06:49:59.150 --> 06:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
by uh more than just the immigration
 
06:50:01.430 --> 06:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
officials they're issued by the US
 
06:50:03.468 --> 06:50:03.478 align:start position:0%
Marshall other local law enforcement
 
06:50:06.830 --> 06:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and um police departments even
 
06:50:10.230 --> 06:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
from other states there are no issues
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
raised about honoring those DET
 
06:50:14.830 --> 06:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
detainers so why are we raising the
 
06:50:17.230 --> 06:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
issue about honoring an immigration
 
06:50:21.110 --> 06:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
detainer and
 
06:50:24.430 --> 06:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
if the immigration detainers aren't
 
06:50:26.830 --> 06:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
honored that doesn't mean that ice won't
 
06:50:29.070 --> 06:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
go after someone in your communities and
 
06:50:30.788 --> 06:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
if they come into your communities it
 
06:50:33.270 --> 06:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
poses a danger to the public because
 
06:50:35.590 --> 06:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're now getting people off the
 
06:50:37.750 --> 06:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
street as opposed to in a secure
 
06:50:40.388 --> 06:50:40.398 align:start position:0%
location like a jail the other thing is
 
06:50:42.750 --> 06:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
if they have to come in there's probably
 
06:50:45.948 --> 06:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
going to be a much wider net cast and
 
06:50:48.510 --> 06:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
people who might not have been caught up
 
06:50:50.910 --> 06:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
could be caught up because of that so
 
06:50:53.190 --> 06:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies could in effect have
 
06:50:55.230 --> 06:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
the opposite um
 
06:50:58.030 --> 06:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
impact and with that I'll um allow
 
06:51:00.430 --> 06:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you we
 
06:51:02.910 --> 06:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time um we really have
 
06:51:07.388 --> 06:51:07.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:14.388 --> 06:51:14.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:18.548 --> 06:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
Costello hello uh Mr chairman and
 
06:51:20.590 --> 06:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
06:51:22.350 --> 06:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
AA Castillo I come from
 
06:51:26.750 --> 06:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester um I am in opposition to this
 
06:51:30.830 --> 06:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill um this bill would further erode
 
06:51:32.868 --> 06:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
the trust that the police department
 
06:51:36.030 --> 06:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
have worked so hard to build in all
 
06:51:37.990 --> 06:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of immigrant
 
06:51:40.990 --> 06:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
communities uh it is unnecessary because
 
06:51:43.510 --> 06:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
the police already collaborates with ice
 
06:51:46.510 --> 06:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
I can tell you many people that I know
 
06:51:47.948 --> 06:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
that have committed crimes that have
 
06:51:50.670 --> 06:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
gone to jail including the brothers of
 
06:51:55.468 --> 06:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
my adopted son ages ago and they go
 
06:51:58.430 --> 06:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
They're sent to prison and then the day
 
06:52:00.510 --> 06:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
they're released from their thing
 
06:52:02.590 --> 06:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
immigration is waiting for them outside
 
06:52:05.910 --> 06:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
right police departments that have put
 
06:52:07.708 --> 06:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
policies in place they know what they're
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
doing and what's good for the
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
communities not one of them has uh
 
06:52:15.990 --> 06:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
forbidden from collaborating with ice
 
06:52:18.670 --> 06:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
they turn anybody that commits a crime
 
06:52:22.350 --> 06:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
they go uh through the process with ice
 
06:52:24.548 --> 06:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
but we do not need to test the police
 
06:52:26.990 --> 06:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
with enforcing federal law which is not
 
06:52:29.150 --> 06:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
their job they're already asked to be
 
06:52:32.070 --> 06:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
social workers drug counselors they do
 
06:52:34.230 --> 06:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
all kind kind of stuff that psychologist
 
06:52:35.868 --> 06:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
they do all kinds of stuff that is not
 
06:52:39.070 --> 06:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
really their stuff we do not need to do
 
06:52:40.948 --> 06:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
the work for the fs that get paid way
 
06:52:44.510 --> 06:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
more than they do by the way so please
 
06:52:47.430 --> 06:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
just you know have the reasoning this is
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
not going to make a community safer and
 
06:52:51.150 --> 06:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
that it really doesn't make any
 
06:52:52.708 --> 06:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
difference anyways because we already
 
06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
are protected by from who we need to be
 
06:52:58.990 --> 06:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
protected and no human being is illegal
 
06:53:01.030 --> 06:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you God bless you thank you God
 
06:53:03.868 --> 06:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
bless you too next
 
06:53:11.628 --> 06:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:15.468 --> 06:53:15.478 align:start position:0%
Wellington good afternoon uh um and
 
06:53:18.070 --> 06:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be extremely brief um
 
06:53:19.510 --> 06:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple points I want to
 
06:53:21.468 --> 06:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
follow up on I'm Christine Wellington
 
06:53:23.948 --> 06:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
I'm from Derry New Hampshire I'm also a
 
06:53:25.468 --> 06:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire immigrants
 
06:53:28.788 --> 06:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
rights Network we did uh send you a
 
06:53:31.270 --> 06:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
letter that more in detail outlines our
 
06:53:35.030 --> 06:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
positions uh I want to say that uh first
 
06:53:38.430 --> 06:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
our our major concern isn't the the um
 
06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
carrying out of criminal law enforcement
 
06:53:43.510 --> 06:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
by any law enforcement entity that finds
 
06:53:45.110 --> 06:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
itself within the Hampshire whether it's
 
06:53:48.868 --> 06:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
federal state local um this is about um
 
06:53:50.990 --> 06:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that appears to prioritize the
 
06:53:54.830 --> 06:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement of civil uh immigration law
 
06:53:57.670 --> 06:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
over the interests of the communities
 
06:53:59.590 --> 06:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
that our local and state police
 
06:54:02.750 --> 06:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
departments serve I I just want to also
 
06:54:04.990 --> 06:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
um emphasize again that the detainers
 
06:54:08.910 --> 06:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
that are referenced in this um Bill are
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
civil detainers that um are based on the
 
06:54:15.548 --> 06:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
immigration officers belief that there's
 
06:54:18.990 --> 06:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause that the um immigrant is
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
removable from the country and and if
 
06:54:24.110 --> 06:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
that person is removable their case will
 
06:54:25.830 --> 06:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
be processed through an administrative
 
06:54:28.388 --> 06:54:28.398 align:start position:0%
law Court not the criminal courts we're
 
06:54:30.030 --> 06:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
not talking about enforcement of
 
06:54:33.230 --> 06:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
criminal law uh the best efforts issue I
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
just there's one other point we also are
 
06:54:37.990 --> 06:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
worried that the that best efforts
 
06:54:40.070 --> 06:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
remove so much discretion that even in
 
06:54:43.468 --> 06:54:43.478 align:start position:0%
the cases where somebody is a victim of
 
06:54:45.788 --> 06:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
um a crime or a witness to a crime or
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise cooperating in a police
 
06:54:50.070 --> 06:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
investigation of a crime uh where that
 
06:54:52.708 --> 06:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
person might be eligible for um some
 
06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
kind of uh t or U Visa or or something
 
06:54:58.270 --> 06:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
else that it may cause the police to
 
06:55:00.190 --> 06:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
still feel they have to report that
 
06:55:02.910 --> 06:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
person to immigration authorities
 
06:55:05.788 --> 06:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
last Point um it I think it's important
 
06:55:07.830 --> 06:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
to note that if there is liability
 
06:55:11.468 --> 06:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
attached to unlawful seizures of people
 
06:55:13.388 --> 06:55:13.398 align:start position:0%
based on detainers the federal
 
06:55:15.510 --> 06:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
government will not indemnify our
 
06:55:17.910 --> 06:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
officers and will not pay the liability
 
06:55:20.430 --> 06:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
cost and we ask the um the committee to
 
06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
consider that as
 
06:55:24.868 --> 06:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
well that is an important point of
 
06:55:28.590 --> 06:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
exposure thank you
 
06:55:38.590 --> 06:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:43.708 --> 06:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:46.150 --> 06:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair members of
 
06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Bob Dunn the director
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
of public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
dasis of Manchester and I'm here today
 
06:55:54.590 --> 06:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
speaking at the speed of sound on behalf
 
06:55:55.948 --> 06:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
of Bishop Peter
 
06:55:59.190 --> 06:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
labashi uh to respectfully oppose this
 
06:56:02.430 --> 06:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
bill um just want to highlight uh pretty
 
06:56:05.270 --> 06:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
much one thing as the folks in this room
 
06:56:09.468 --> 06:56:09.478 align:start position:0%
are well aware um and I've been working
 
06:56:11.948 --> 06:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
in the state government the legislature
 
06:56:14.070 --> 06:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
since I was an Assistant Attorney
 
06:56:16.070 --> 06:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
General back in the late 80s and the
 
06:56:19.190 --> 06:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
assistant Commissioner of safety in the
 
06:56:21.750 --> 06:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
early and mid 90s and one of the first
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
things I learned was that the department
 
06:56:26.430 --> 06:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
of safety and the New Hampshire Chiefs
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
of police are never shy about coming to
 
06:56:31.788 --> 06:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature to make suggestions
 
06:56:34.350 --> 06:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
about legislation that will protect the
 
06:56:38.110 --> 06:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
public safety and so I think it's highly
 
06:56:40.948 --> 06:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
notable that this legislation although
 
06:56:43.948 --> 06:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
it's intended as a public safety measure
 
06:56:47.708 --> 06:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
does not come from the very people that
 
06:56:51.070 --> 06:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
we have tasked with uh being responsible
 
06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
for Public Safety in our cities and
 
06:56:59.468 --> 06:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
towns and uh the police Chiefs uh in
 
06:57:01.468 --> 06:57:01.478 align:start position:0%
many of or some of those cities and
 
06:57:07.310 --> 06:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
towns uh I understand do have uh a do
 
06:57:09.868 --> 06:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
exercise some discretion with respect to
 
06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
how they deal with these detainers
 
06:57:16.590 --> 06:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
discretion that would be removed by this
 
06:57:17.590 --> 06:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
06:57:20.388 --> 06:57:20.398 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and they feel obviously
 
06:57:22.350 --> 06:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
that it's important to do that in order
 
06:57:24.590 --> 06:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that those lines of
 
06:57:28.670 --> 06:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
communication and Trust are maintained
 
06:57:32.430 --> 06:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
and that therefore crimes don't go unre
 
06:57:36.190 --> 06:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
reported um and so the to the extent
 
06:57:38.070 --> 06:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
that our Chiefs have made decisions
 
06:57:40.830 --> 06:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
about trying to exercise some discretion
 
06:57:44.270 --> 06:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
here I think that we need to rely on
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
them to know best what will protect the
 
06:57:51.670 --> 06:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety in this state thank
 
06:57:55.430 --> 06:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
