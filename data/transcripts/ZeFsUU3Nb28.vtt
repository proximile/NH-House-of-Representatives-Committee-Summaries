00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the allegiance for which it stands
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
one nation under god indivisible with
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
all was a little bit surprised when i
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
arrived this morning to see the message
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
boards down in the lobby didn't list
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
this meeting this morning but it is
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
listed in the calendar
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh trust that everybody who
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
needed to be here for this meeting
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
one person who is conspicuously absent
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
from this meeting is the subcommittee
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
chair representative doug
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
thomas when he scheduled this meeting he
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
forgot that he had an 8 30 medical
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
appointment in nashua
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
and he said he would be here as soon as
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
he could get here after that medical
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
appointment so we expect the arrival of
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
virtually any minute
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other things i'd
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
like to discuss
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee issues
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
before we get into this substance of our
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that is last tuesday we had a
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting about our interim
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we reviewed six interim study bills
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
and our committee researcher kristen
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back there
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
happened to notice that there were two
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
interim study bills from the previous
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
year that we forgot to
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
include in last week's organizational
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
meeting they were house bill 213
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
and senate bill
 
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
and senate bill
113

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
113
 
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
113
and

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
both of those bills will need to be
 
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.230 align:start position:0%
both of those bills will need to be
included

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by us in the fall
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to remind all committee
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
members of that
 
00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
members of that
and

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
point out that we will
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
make a judgment about whether to
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i guess we can begin our
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
meeting today now as i pointed out
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is the
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair and he had an agenda
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
for this meeting
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i do not know what that
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
agenda is or was
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how we're going to
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
proceed here this morning
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
i guess we could start by asking if
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
there are any committee members who
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%

one of the things that i
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
i feel is very necessary is education of
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
um towns and municipalities so
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%

the municipal association but
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for the new hampshire
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
municipal association but i can
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
certainly speak for the town that i live
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
in which is bedford
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
i was very instrumental in forming a
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
telecommunications committee in the town
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
and doing things that can help to
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
have all of our broadband which is
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
extremely important and all of our
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
technology because it's important to say
 
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
technology because it's important to say
that

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe anybody is saying we
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have it that we cannot go back
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
in time it's more about safer
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
sustainable technology and so we've been
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
able to put things in place
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
with safe setbacks and still maintain a
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
very good quality of broadband and at
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
some point if i can bring you lots of
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
information what we did how we did it
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
the ordinances that we put in we put it
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
on the ballot the people got to vote it
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
was done very well so hopefully that'll
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%

and a member of
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh two of their committees one is the
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
committee on man and
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
radiation which we're
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
actually considering changing the name
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
to mankind and radiation
 
00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
to mankind and radiation
and

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
the international committee on
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic safety which
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
is the one that writes of one of the
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
major safety standards in the world
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
for rf exposure
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
i chair the american radio relay league
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
or arrl rf safety committee that's the
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
society of amateur radio operators
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
also worked over in england
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
on with their amateur radio operators to
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
help them
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
conform to the
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
i i sit on a committee at the fcc called
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
the technological advisory council
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
and i'm also a member of the national
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
fire protection association public
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
today i want to talk to you about
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
four topics
 
00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:09.829 align:start position:0%
four topics
just

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably a review for many of you basic
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic principles but
 
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.389 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic principles but
why

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be afraid of radio
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
frequencies and
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
how they fit into the broad range of
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic signals
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
the safety standards and the scientific
 
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
the safety standards and the scientific
literature

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
literature
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
because there are groups that have been
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
studying this for a long time and want
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
to make sure it remains safe
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
the applicability of the fcc regulatory
 
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.189 align:start position:0%
the applicability of the fcc regulatory
limits

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
limits
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
which are based on those safety
 
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.069 align:start position:0%
which are based on those safety
standards

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit about 5g what's different
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
about it than the cellular that we've
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
if you want to flip over to page four
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
let me start with the basic
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic principles
 
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.629 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic principles
so

00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
so
electromagnetics

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
electromagnetics
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
covers everything down from
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
almost dc
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
within the engineering world we say dc
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
to light but it's
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
down to something with almost no
 
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
down to something with almost no
frequency

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
to the very very very high frequencies
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
which are which can be dangerous they're
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
all electromagnetic waves they all
 
00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
all electromagnetic waves they all
physically

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
physically
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
are similar to each other
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
but they have different frequencies and
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's the frequency that is the thing
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
the distinction between them
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
they're all called radiation because
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
they radiate they go from here to there
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with danger it just
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with the fact that it can move
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
through space
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
for human health there's a major
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
distinction which lies somewhere around
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet light
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
frequencies below this are called
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation and the
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
frequencies above are called ionizing
 
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
frequencies above are called ionizing
radiation

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
the ionizing radiation can damage tissue
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
by breaking apart molecules
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
which would include dna
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
and the non-ionization radiation really
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
can only interact with tissue by
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
generating heat
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
and on that
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
page five you can see
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
the way down at the lowest frequencies
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
our power lines are 60 hertz very low
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
we have radio the thing that says radio
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
is really fm radio there's am radio
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
below that
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh cell phones
 
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.710 align:start position:0%
uh cell phones
of

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
that we've been using all along fit in
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
along there
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
you get up into the microwave region
 
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.670 align:start position:0%
you get up into the microwave region
where

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
radar is
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the frequency keeps increasing until
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
you get to light
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
visible light is also an electromagnetic
 
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
visible light is also an electromagnetic
signal

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
signal
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
just like a radio wave
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
except that our eyes can see it our eyes
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
are attuned to see those frequencies
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
and then through the light spectrum when
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
you get up to ultraviolet light that's
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
when it starts to be dangerous and we
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
know that because people worry about
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
skin cancer from being out in the sun
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
too long and we use
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
things that filter out those frequencies
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
sun and then of course
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
higher and higher in frequencies it gets
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
more and more dangerous you have x-rays
 
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
more and more dangerous you have x-rays
which

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.189 align:start position:0%
you know
they're

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
not perfectly safe but they're necessary
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
for medical use
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then all the way up to gamma rays
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
when we communicate we try we try we do
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
stay below
 
00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:45.510 align:start position:0%
stay below
the

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
limit of ionizing radiation so that
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
everything we use for communication is
 
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.549 align:start position:0%
everything we use for communication is
non-ionizing

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
let's talk about electromagnetic
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic safety standards
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
so these are standards that examine the
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
scientific research to set human
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
exposure levels that have been shown to
 
00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:12.830 align:start position:0%
exposure levels that have been shown to
be

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
safe the preeminent
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
emf standards are the ieee c95 that's
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
the one written by the ice committee
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
which i sit on
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and ichnerp which is in
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
europe it's most of the european
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
countries follow that one the two are
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
very similar in their limits
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to talk mostly about c95
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
because that's the one i know best
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
in the u.s
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
ieee c95 is the basis for most of the
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
fcc regulations
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
standards examine experimental effects
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
of emf on laboratory animals and
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
epidemiological data
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
so the exposure limits
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
are then set to be 50 times lower
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
than the lowest exposure level that
 
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
than the lowest exposure level that
could

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
the ieee
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
c95.1 standard was the very first
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic standard
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
safety standard that was generated it
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
was initiated by the u.s navy and the
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
ieee in 1960.
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
the first version that was released the
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
first safety standard was in 1966 and
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
then versions were released in 17 1974
 
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.630 align:start position:0%
then versions were released in 17 1974

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
1991 1999 2005 and the latest in 2019
 
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
1991 1999 2005 and the latest in 2019
standards

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.789 align:start position:0%
standards
are

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
developed by the ieee international
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee on electromagnetic safety isis
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
which i sit on
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
they're actually meeting right now
 
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
they're actually meeting right now
but

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
this this is their week for meetings and
 
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.110 align:start position:0%
this this is their week for meetings and
they're

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
when i left them they were discussing
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
copyrights but uh
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
not something that
 
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
not something that
would

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
interest you all that much
 
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
interest you all that much
um

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.669 align:start position:0%
um
this

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
the 1991 standard was the one which the
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
fcc regulations were based on
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
the fcc regulations were written in 1986
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 1996
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the 91 standard was the latest for
 
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.789 align:start position:0%
and the 91 standard was the latest for
them

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
it was the first version of the standard
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
that chose to vary the exposure limits
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
with frequency so prior to that one
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
exposure limit was used for all
 
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.230 align:start position:0%
exposure limit was used for all
frequencies

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
frequencies
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
of course in time we are using more
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
frequencies than we used to
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh it covers the frequencies from three
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
kilohertz so very low frequency all the
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
way up to all the way up to 300
 
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
way up to all the way up to 300
gigahertz

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
gigahertz
 
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
gigahertz
um

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.909 align:start position:0%
you know for
uh

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
that that's uh i don't know how to say
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
this to a non-engineer but three
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
kilohertz is 3000 hertz
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
300 gigahertz is 300 billion hertz
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
oh it hurts yes a hertz is a cycle per
 
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.549 align:start position:0%
oh it hurts yes a hertz is a cycle per
second

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:11.350 align:start position:0%
second
and

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
we in the old days we used to call it
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
cycles for cycles
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
but now
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
they've named it after someone named
 
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
they've named it after someone named
hertz

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
it was based on 498
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
publications of
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
scientific work in rf safety
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
and it even in the millimeter wave
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
region which is the one i'll i'll bring
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
up why that's important it had 11
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
publications this this is back in the
 
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.669 align:start position:0%
publications this this is back in the
90s

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
90s
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
and again its safety limits were set to
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
be 50 times lower than any level that
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
the literature said could cause
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
the latest version on page nine the
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
latest version of the standard is 2019 c
 
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
latest version of the standard is 2019 c
95.1-2019

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
95.1-2019
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's based on
 
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.149 align:start position:0%
and it's based on
1550

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
1550
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
high quality studies
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
now i say high quality studies because
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that there's a
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
lot of literature out there that was not
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
science that was well done
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.750 align:start position:0%
and so
to

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
use the best science
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
each of those publications
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
was studied by five experts
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
um i i was one of those in fact
 
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
um i i was one of those in fact
so

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
rough today there are roughly 5 000
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
publications on this topic
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
going all the way from power line
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
frequencies all the way up into the
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
gigahertz frequencies
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a wide range
 
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.909 align:start position:0%
so it's a wide range
but

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
to determine which of those were worth
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
using or
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
something we could trust
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
five experts in whatever the topic was
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's the low frequencies or the
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
high frequencies or
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
medical based
 
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
medical based
research

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
each independently read each of those
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
five thousand papers it was a little
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
less than five thousand back then but um
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
then they all voted on whether it was
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
good science or not and
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
the consensus of those five was used to
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
choose the 1550
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the best studies that were used to
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
determine what the standards would be
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh that re that review went all the way
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
back to 1950
 
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.070 align:start position:0%
back to 1950
and

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
up till 2017 when the
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
standard was worked on
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
exposure limits were set by identifying
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
the levels at which any potential
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
harmful effects we're seeing so
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
previously it was based on heat heat
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
generation because that
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
was what was known to be
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
a danger
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
at uh around 2005 they decided let's
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
look at everything that could possibly
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
cause any harm anything that mentioned
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
a biological change
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
look at the limit of exposure that
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
caused that and then again divide by 50
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and set that to be the safety standard
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
the frequency range was also expanded
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
down to zero hertz or zero cycles per
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
second although and again up to 300
 
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
second although and again up to 300
gigahertz

00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
gigahertz
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
the safe exposure limits
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
that they came out with are very similar
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
to the ichner or the international
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
commission for non-ionizing
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
radiation protection in europe
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
they came out with a 2020 standard
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the limits are very similar they did
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the two groups didn't work together but
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
base it on the same science so it's not
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:05.909 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
just to show
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
who was working on developing those
 
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.630 align:start position:0%
who was working on developing those
standards

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
this these are the
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
back in 2006 that's when this
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
this statistic was made but these are
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the people working on the standard
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh people from academia people from
 
00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:22.870 align:start position:0%

government

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%

uh

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
some people from industry some
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
consultants and even a couple from the
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
general public and all those people took
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
part in developing
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
on page 11
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
the fcc made regulatory limits now
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
unlike the science the regulatory limits
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
are based
 
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.630 align:start position:0%
are based
are

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
are law
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um manufacturers have to meet when they
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
um manufacturers have to meet when they
generate

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
generate
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
rf signals and they make phones
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
their phones have to meet those limits
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
in order
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
um the experience
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
since the regulations were originally
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
written in 1996 has shown that they are
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently protective in 2019 the fda
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
concluded that no changes to the current
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
standards are warranted
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
based on their monitoring of public
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
health trends in other words they saw
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
that these limits
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
the american cancer society has
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
consistently shown no increases and many
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
decreases in the rates of most cancers
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
since cellular technology was first
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
introduced in 1985.

though this increase in cellular
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
cellular telephone use has grown
 
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.029 align:start position:0%
cellular telephone use has grown

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
no disease has increased

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
indicates something like that this is

this is concentrating on glioma's brain

the blue line shows that the glioma rate

deadly brain tumor
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
um that's the one that has
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
been decreasing over time slightly it's
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's hasn't changed much but it's
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
slightly decreased
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
since 1985 all the way to 2015.
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
yet the number of cell phones in use has
 
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:32.300 align:start position:0%

i have a question
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay go ahead
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the statistic you've uh cited to us over
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
the last three or four pages all had to
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
do with cancer
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
or there are there any studies that
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
study that have looked at other health

a lot of studies done and
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge not one of them has
 
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge not one of them has
shown

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%

00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i think
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
can and um
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think the uh
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
this this particular slide the the 15
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
i got a question for you sir um
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
i know the uh
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
the 2019
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
standard was set and no change from the
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
prior time that was set
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
but there was a lawsuit
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
in the uh district court of d.c
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
and the court said that
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the conclusions were arbitrary and
 
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.630 align:start position:0%
that the conclusions were arbitrary and
capricious

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
capricious
 
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
capricious
because

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
the the all the all the evidence was not
 
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.630 align:start position:0%
the the all the all the evidence was not
reviewed

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and that they had to go
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
they told the fcc to go back to the
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
drawing board
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that um
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
i haven't read the case but i am aware
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
that the fcc did go back to the drawing
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
board and
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think they they upheld their
 
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.909 align:start position:0%
i think they they upheld their
regulations

00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the implication was that not all the
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
science was looked at is the implication
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
from that is all i want to point out
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and when they did go back they have
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
been looking at
 
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
been looking at
uh

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
as much science as they can get their
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
hands on okay thank you
 
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
hands on okay thank you
representative

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:49.029 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
questions

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh with your indulgence mr chairman uh
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
you said that the
 
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.430 align:start position:0%
you said that the
ieee

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
ieee
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
standard is based on the 1991 version
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
of excuse me the uh
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
yeah the 1991 version of
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
ieee c95
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
um safety standards ieee
 
00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
um safety standards ieee
95.1

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
95.1
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh and you said that uh
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
the current recommendation was based on
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
the 1991 version the current standard
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
that's what i wrote
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between the 91
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
standard and the
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
91 version and the several versions that
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow about the 2019
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.630 align:start position:0%
um the
the

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh there's very little difference in in
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
the standard um they they've not
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
found anything
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would uh give them evidence to
 
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.269 align:start position:0%
that would uh give them evidence to
change

00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
change
uh

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
say there's a health
 
00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:49.350 align:start position:0%
say there's a health
problem

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
okay the fcc stand is based on uh the
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
most recent anyway 2019 you said is that
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
um when you said you
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
researched you had five researchers
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
review all of the studies
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
and selected those that are you the five
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
people from various industries various
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
backgrounds viewed as credible what
 
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
backgrounds viewed as credible what
criteria

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
how do you ensure that there is not
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what you're asking the the
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's simple if you have five people who
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
believe in the stuff
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying that's the case
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
you'll pick out ones that are that are
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of your of the viewpoint and
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
neglect the ones that are not supportive
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm not accusing anybody of that
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
but how do you ensure that there isn't
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
confirmation bias that it's based on
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
pure science
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
that they look at all the science that
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
i i
there's

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
a wealth of literature out there
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.270 align:start position:0%
and the
um

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know that people sit and
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
look over it and criticize it
 
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.829 align:start position:0%
look over it and criticize it
uh

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
as much as they possibly can
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.829 align:start position:0%
as much as they possibly can
and

00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the lit they look at the literature
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
of what has been written scientifically
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
about it
and

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
come up with a decision on
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
if if someone comes out with a study
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
that says that
um

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
says that there's a disease
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
what the conditions were that would
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
cause that disease
 
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.190 align:start position:0%
cause that disease
and and

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.069 align:start position:0%
and and
their

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
their
um

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know their conclusions have always
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
been that uh there is no not enough
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that that disease is
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
source

00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
i have two questions that
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
occurred to me and i was writing them
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
down to wait till you were in the
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
presentation but i'll ask them now
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
one is was the has the cumulative effect
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
been studied in other words well my cell
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
phone is not a problem
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
affected by other sources and when we
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
look just at one
 
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.190 align:start position:0%
look just at one
source

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
that may
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
precipitate a different outcome than the
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect that that's currently
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm very simplistic
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
i know when i go down
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
the highway in certain places where
 
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.990 align:start position:0%
the highway in certain places where
there's

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
high frequency say electric lines i
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
can't listen to my quote-unquote radio
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
because i don't have satellite and the
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
other question i'm just going to
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
dovetail it
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
um was there were two incidences that
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
that sparked my interest in this whole
 
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
that sparked my interest in this whole
subject

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
was one the evacuation of embassies and
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if that was the same
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
because it was radio frequencies i do
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
believe that caused the evacuation of
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
some american embassies overseas and the
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
fcc's concern over engines
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
and of course all that was cleared and
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
supposedly but is that the same type of
 
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
supposedly but is that the same type of
radiation

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
well when you talk about
 
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
well when you talk about
um

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
the when you talk
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
about say the embassies uh they were
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
being spun
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to when the
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
embassies that were being spied on
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
so so some very high powered
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
signals were being sent in to do that
 
00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
signals were being sent in to do that
spying

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the same thing i
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
think we are and i i'm may i follow
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
was that the same type of frequency not
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
intensity but the same types of
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
frequencies that we are all subject to
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
yes we're we're all subject to
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
a wide wide range of frequencies
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.430 align:start position:0%
so if um
but

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
the exposure level i think is what made
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the big difference
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
in what you're referring to
 
00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:36.390 align:start position:0%
in what you're referring to
that

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
and you're referring to the embassy
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
spying things the very high
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
could

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of damage to people
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
were being uh generated and does that
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
dovetail on our
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
cumulative exposure
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.109 align:start position:0%
cumulative exposure
daily

00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
daily
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know from from different things from
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh satellite dishes from everything in
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
our atmosphere i mean we seem to be more
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
and more dependent on you know bluetooth
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
and all these things
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
does that take into effect the
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
cumulative um exposure that we all have
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
every day so at the lower frequencies
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
considered to build up in your body
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
they do not so there's nothing
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
radioactive radiation which which will
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
build up
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
but these are transitory they just
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the biggest effect that's been seen
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest damage that's been
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
seen they they
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
generate heat in your in your tissues
 
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
generate heat in your in your tissues
and

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
if the levels are kept low enough then
 
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.670 align:start position:0%
if the levels are kept low enough then
that

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
heat is not a dent
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's not enough heat is built up to
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
cause any danger
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
i was thinking about this uh as you were
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
going through the different things here
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
and as you're probably aware as long as
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
we've been studying radiation in fact i
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
know you're aware uh we've been debating
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
the linear no threshold model and
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
whether that's the most accurate one
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
nuclear news just had an article in it
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
last month about some guy said it was
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely not the correct way that you
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
get to a certain cut-off point where
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
there is no negative effect from
 
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
there is no negative effect from
radiation

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
is this i'm and i'm not familiar with
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the fcc stuff as well as i'm nuclear is
 
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.829 align:start position:0%
the fcc stuff as well as i'm nuclear is
my

00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
but is this based on that linear no
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
threshold model that you're assuming so
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
that any amount receives some damage but
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's just infinitesimally small or are
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
these based on a cut-off point when we
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
say below this radiation level there is
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
no damage
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
more of the latter
 
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.309 align:start position:0%
more of the latter
in

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're referring more to
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh ionizing radiation
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
radiation and so non-ionizing radiation
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
the damage that it creates is is heat
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
it generates heat and if
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
if your body can deal with the heat then
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's no damage
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
is very different it's different
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
but you're basing on the idea that
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
at a certain level that even if it's a
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
minuscule amount of heat generated and
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about much then there
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
really really isn't any damage to the
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
person is that the point of this um
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
unlike the ionizing radiation you're
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
saying but for the 9993 yeah
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
there is no linear no threshold model
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's you get to a certain point when it
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's low enough it doesn't have any
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
harmful effects it's at least measurable
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right okay thank you i
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure i got that
 
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.750 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure i got that
correct

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes dr lo
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
layton latman lapin okay uh apologize
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
for being late if i repeat any questions
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that if it wasn't
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
previously stated at the start of this
 
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.589 align:start position:0%
previously stated at the start of this
meeting

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the interim study is
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
basically to determine if there's any
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
follow-on legislative action in the in
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
the coming year
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the testimonies that we'll hear
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
in this meeting and if we have others
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
will determine if we need
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
my opening statement would have been
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
i believe all this information that
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
you're briefing was previously studied
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
in another
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
study and i did some research prior to
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill that came before us
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
this year and
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
saw the same results that that you're
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
stating now more or less you went into a
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
lot better detail of of course
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
and if i was to look at those studies
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
i would say no brainer this bill had no
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
bearing and we wouldn't be here now
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
but one
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
little thing
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
kept me thinking that we might
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
want to further discuss this and see if
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
something could be could come up with
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps something that wasn't in the
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislative statute but perhaps might be
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
something that might be done
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
on a
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
quasi-voluntary nature and that one
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
little something was
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
we kept hearing person after person
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
after person coming in here
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
complaining of
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
some type of ill effects not necessarily
 
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
some type of ill effects not necessarily
disease

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't correlate this cancer or
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that but headaches
 
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
anything like that but headaches
disturbances

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
disturbances
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
um things in their life that just wasn't
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
going weren't going right and they all
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
seemed to correlate around being near
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
this type of technology now we know and
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
we're not here to determine if any
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
disturbances

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
disturbances
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
but there certainly appears to be a
 
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.270 align:start position:0%
but there certainly appears to be a
correlation

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
with distance and proximity to this type
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
of technology so what we're really what
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
i really like to hear
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
if if not from you but perhaps other
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
speakers is
 
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.589 align:start position:0%
speakers is
what

00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
we we need to we need to acknowledge
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of people in the
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
state that have had issues we need to
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily placing blame per se but
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
is there something
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
that this technology or the vendors of
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
this technology can look at
 
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
this technology can look at
and

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know without going bankrupt
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
is there something that they can do to
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
help mitigate uh or look at these people
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and say look if we if we went vertical
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
instead of horizontal or if went
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
horizontal instead of vertical
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
maybe this would help them even though
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
our stats kind of say
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to but perhaps
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
something could be done in that line of
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
work that's what i'm kind of looking for
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
here is some type of information that
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
without you know having to resort to a a
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
statute if if you will and and uh so if
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
there's anything that you could suggest
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
in your briefing or anyone else
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
following up on that it would be very
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
helpful just to hear that to see
 
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
helpful just to hear that to see
just

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
because you're the experts and we want
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
to know i know engineers we can do this
 
00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:37.910 align:start position:0%
to know i know engineers we can do this
way

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
the best way or maybe we can do it this
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
way it's a little more of an issue but
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll help solve this problem
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
over here that's how
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this and so i'd like to
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
get your comments and thoughts on that
 
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
get your comments and thoughts on that
um

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking for is can you give us
 
00:46:00.079 --> 00:46:02.069 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking for is can you give us
any

00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
potential solutions that we can look at
 
00:46:05.119 --> 00:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
potential solutions that we can look at
for

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.829 align:start position:0%
for
helping

00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
people that seem to be susceptible i
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
know there's a small amount of them but
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are still out there that
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
that are having issues being near this
 
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
that are having issues being near this
technology

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
i know i don't but i know people do
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
because they came before us and and and
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
they told us that's what we're not
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
saying blame i'm just saying is there
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
something that we can do to help help
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
them help mitigate something i i know
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
that the bill that we are studying here
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
talks about putting things at what 1700
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
feet away and i believe
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
it appears to be unacceptable to to the
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
vendors right
 
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
vendors right
so

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe there's something else we can look
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
at to help these people
 
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
at to help these people
uh

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
if you know what i mean you're referring
 
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.829 align:start position:0%
if you know what i mean you're referring
to

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
what what's often called
 
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.790 align:start position:0%
what what's often called
electrosensitivity

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
electrosensitivity
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh well if you want to label that i
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
believe that's what people are being
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
affected by yes okay but uh
 
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.390 align:start position:0%
affected by yes okay but uh
perhaps

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
we want to hear from this representative
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
loki before he answers that thank you mr
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh mr lapham um
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think one basic thing that we might
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to agree on is the you know what
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
happens with signal strength i know that
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
that thing i think is putting out 12
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
watts at i forget what the band is
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
now i'm receiving some amount of
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
radiation from that so are you so is
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative berezni now approximately
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
how much less energy is represented
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
rationally getting from that as compared
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
to myself
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
and how that changes with distance i
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
think that might be a useful thing to
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
are you asking
 
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.910 align:start position:0%
are you asking
[Music]

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
let me say it in words maybe i i i was
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:56.510 align:start position:0%
one way to
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
one way to
[Music]

00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
do your
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
technology work as a vendor if there's
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
one place to put it versus another place
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
but that one place you're putting it
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
might be a little more sensitive to
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
people that may be overly reactive as
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to a different place
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you are able to do that different
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
place would you not choose that option
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
in order to help mitigate and and at
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
least uh accept the fact that some
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
people may be more more sensitive at
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
certain distances versus others
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not an engineer but but i
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
was i was just saying that i am an
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
insult okay i apologize since i was late
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
coming in here but but
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
being a being
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
with engineers my entire life i know
 
00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.349 align:start position:0%
with engineers my entire life i know
there's

00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
the very best way there's 100 percent
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
word then there's 85 way i mean so i'm
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
can we look at is it possible to look at
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis positions of
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
antennas and so forth that might be
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
less desirable in one case but more
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
desirable in another case that's that
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm asking is something like
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
that that could be looked at
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure it could i'm not sure
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of considerations in
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
a system design
 
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.630 align:start position:0%
a system design
and

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that those kind of things could
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
i know you and i chatted before this
 
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
i know you and i chatted before this
subcommittee

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
about who you wanted to be here you
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
wanted representatives from the actual
 
00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:35.589 align:start position:0%
wanted representatives from the actual
industry

00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
that from the three major companies to
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
be here
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
to have this discussion
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
dr lapin
 
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
dr lapin
uh

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
is that i think he's a general
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
scientist engineer that consults i would
 
00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:54.390 align:start position:0%
scientist engineer that consults i would
imagine

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
to different companies
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh is is on the is on the
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh what did you call it the fcc
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
technical advisory committee which gives
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
you a certain amount of uh knowledge of
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on behind the scenes there
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
which i find interesting
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't think he's i don't think
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
he's in a position to answer that
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm the i'm the gentleman who i'm the
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman who
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
who chaired the the 5g commission here
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i know i know we we we tried for a
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
long time to try to understand the
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
antennas and what's inside those
 
00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:31.430 align:start position:0%
antennas and what's inside those
antennas

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
antennas
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
and how they're configured but none of
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's all proprietary
 
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.150 align:start position:0%
that's that's all proprietary
information

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
we could never get to that
 
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.670 align:start position:0%
we could never get to that
um

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.390 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know we were hoping for for the
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
industry i don't know if we really got
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
the industry here we got we got a
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
scientist which we appreciate an
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
engineer we appreciate
 
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.829 align:start position:0%
engineer we appreciate
but

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i i have some other comments
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
about let me let me mention one one
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
other thing uh when you and another
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
question for for him
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned all the recent work
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
the signs that you that the your
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee looked at
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
but how about the national toxicology
 
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.349 align:start position:0%
but how about the national toxicology
program

00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.790 align:start position:0%
program
um

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars program that's the
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
the national toxicology program is part
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the national science foundation
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
the government spent 30 million dollars
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
and came out with what a report that
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
said there is evidence of of certain
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
types of cancers due to due to
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that that you go
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
back to your group and say hey do we
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh and this is what we've been fighting
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
all along we've been fighting
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
the fcc it's very difficult for any
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
community any state any anyone
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
to battle the the
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
1996 uh
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
telecommunication act which gave
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
the industry free reign
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
and thereof there are
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
but okay i'm giving a speech so i i i
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
just i just hope you would carry that
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
message back to your group
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh that there are others there are a lot
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
of studies out there that are showing
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing effects
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
that are biological effects not just not
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
just heat heat's an old-school thing
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's beyond heat now there are
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
studies showing dna damage and and
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
they're showing cancers
 
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.150 align:start position:0%
they're showing cancers
so

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it is all about power density it's
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
all about power density and we don't
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
know what's coming out of those antennas
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
at all times we also have to watch out
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
for pulsing
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
the impacts of of pulsing
 
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.750 align:start position:0%
the impacts of of pulsing
signals

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
signals
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh things like that so um those are my
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
comments if you want to comment on any
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
of that i'd appreciate it thank you
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um please do
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
are you saying that that
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's evidence of
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
of um
say

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
some diseases from
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.470 align:start position:0%
excuse me
levels

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
under the limits
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes there are
 
00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:21.829 align:start position:0%
yes there are
um

00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's a whole discussion in
 
00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:24.309 align:start position:0%
that's that's a whole discussion in
itself

00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.190 align:start position:0%
itself
but

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
um and that's why i think
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's why i think like i just said a
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
moment ago that
 
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.589 align:start position:0%
moment ago that
that

00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:32.390 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
d.c district court said
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the results
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
of i would imagine your group
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
are arbitrary and capricious because all
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
the science wasn't studied the science
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
is there it's for you to study
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh and that's my comment
 
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
uh and that's my comment
okay

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not a position right now to start
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
showing you examples of that there are
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of examples of that i
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
understand yeah
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh representatives um
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a question pertaining to
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
what was said so far or to what he's
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
what i what i thought i heard
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we were trying to do
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
is proximity is there a safe range where
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
we should stay away from these things
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that's very simplistic because my
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
brain works that way
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's all is there a range that if i'm
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
so close
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
i'm in more trouble or if i'm back and i
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
think that's further on in your
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
think that's further on in your
uh

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
in your presentation the other thing i
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
i guess a little bit
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
argumentative but if the courts
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
and everybody thought there was such
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
great danger that we haven't all been
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
exposed to right now
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if there's been an
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
injunction placed against placing these
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
antennas and i don't believe so so i
 
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
antennas and i don't believe so so i
just

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
i would like you to
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
see if you could
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
hone in on what we're trying to figure
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
out is a proximity
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
how far away do i stay or do i
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
head into outer space
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.589 align:start position:0%
um
well

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's no simple answer to that because
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's not the distance as much as as it
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
is exposure
 
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.109 align:start position:0%
is exposure
so

00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
different things transmit different
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
you know
not

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't germaine necessarily but
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
you hold your cell phone right next to
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
your head
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so that that's very close you're
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
you're much further away from
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
what the cell phone is talking to
 
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:59.109 align:start position:0%
what the cell phone is talking to
and

00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
and they transmit difference of
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
different amounts of power so you just
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't give one distance
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
as as the correct
 
00:56:07.599 --> 00:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
as as the correct
answer

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.750 align:start position:0%
is
yes

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas's chairman
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
thomas's statement that a tweak here or
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
there could somehow improve things you'd
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
have to have a basis
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem right and you
 
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.430 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem right and you
don't

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
but but on the other hand i'm hearing
 
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
but but on the other hand i'm hearing
from

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative abrami that maybe you
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
didn't look at all the studies and and
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
so if you look at some of the studies
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
like the 30 million one would you reach
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
a different conclusion if not why not
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at that study and
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
discredit it for some reason or other is
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's what you were asking yeah um so
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
so the the safety standards do look at
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
all studies
 
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.270 align:start position:0%
all studies
and

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
comparing this one against that one to
 
00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:10.069 align:start position:0%
comparing this one against that one to
see

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
what is the most reproducible and what
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
is the most uh believable
 
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.309 align:start position:0%
is the most uh believable
of

00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's a great answer to
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.789 align:start position:0%
your question
but

00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
if i were to interpret that you did look
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
at this 30 million dollar
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
study and discredit it as not being
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
credible for
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
i didn't personally but i mean the group
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
a group looked at looked at all the
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
studies and and built a consensus
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think we've asked a lot of
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions here i'd like to have the
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
doctor continue with this presentation
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:52.069 align:start position:0%
so the
um

00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
can you remember where i left off i was
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
on slide 10 um just showing the makeup
 
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:58.789 align:start position:0%
on slide 10 um just showing the makeup
of

00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.069 align:start position:0%
of
the

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
i must've i turned back i'm sorry
 
00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
i must've i turned back i'm sorry
so

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
so i mentioned about the fcc regulatory
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
limits and then the uh
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
the different
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
agencies that
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and that there's a list here that you
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
can see
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
so let's get on
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
the 5g that um
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great catchword and it
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
really is a combination of communication
 
00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:58.549 align:start position:0%
really is a combination of communication
technologies

00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
um it's 5g obviously stands for fifth
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
generation so cellular technology
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
its claim to fame is it
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
advances the technology to provide
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
better performance than the previous
 
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.069 align:start position:0%
better performance than the previous
generations

00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
generations
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
higher speeds
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
better data transfer
 
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.710 align:start position:0%
better data transfer
and

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
it uses most of the same frequency bands
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the previous generations did and
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
adds a few more
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
and not all frequencies are used in all
 
00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.710 align:start position:0%
and not all frequencies are used in all
locations

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
so if you go on to the slide 17
 
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.950 align:start position:0%
so if you go on to the slide 17
the

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
frequency bands used
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
for 5g
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
consist of a low low band region
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
a mid band region and a high band region
 
00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
a mid band region and a high band region
the

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
low band
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
was used from the very beginning
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of cellular technology
 
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.950 align:start position:0%
beginning of cellular technology
mid-band

00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
mid-band
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
came a little bit later it added more
 
01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:03.510 align:start position:0%
came a little bit later it added more
more

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
data speed
 
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.750 align:start position:0%
data speed
and

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that as the bands get into
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
the higher and higher frequencies
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
they propagate
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
much shorter distances
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
a principle of of propagation of
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
frequencies so the
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
the low the low band
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
the cell towers were placed further
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
apart because they they could
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
talk further but in those low
 
01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
talk further but in those low
frequencies

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
frequencies
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
not as much data could be transmitted
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
and then a mid band was added
 
01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:46.069 align:start position:0%
and then a mid band was added
with

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
the 2g 3g and 4g
 
01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
the 2g 3g and 4g
uh

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
iterations of cellular
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
and then the high band is the
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
real addition to the
 
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.710 align:start position:0%
real addition to the
5g

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much propagates very short
 
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.069 align:start position:0%
pretty much propagates very short
distances

01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
distances
 
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
distances
so

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
as we go
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
you find that the low band because it'll
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
propagate longer distances you find it
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
more in rural areas
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
and often the towers are very high
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
because it can get down to the ground it
 
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.270 align:start position:0%
because it can get down to the ground it
can

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.710 align:start position:0%
can
um

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
reach the long distance and lots of
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
lots of users can make use of that those
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
low band frequencies
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the mid band and it's also called sub
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
six gigahertz
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
good in most locations and it has a good
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
balance between data transfer rates and
 
01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:50.390 align:start position:0%
balance between data transfer rates and
and

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
the density of cells by density i mean
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
how close you have to put the different
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
cell towers
 
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.069 align:start position:0%
cell towers
or

01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
transmitter receivers
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
and then the high band which is also
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
called millimeter wave
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
um is for is really used in very densely
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
populated areas
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's areas that need
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
high data transfer rates
 
01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
high data transfer rates
and

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
that have lots and lots of people
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
because all those people have to share
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
the same frequencies to get their data
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:24.870 align:start position:0%
the same frequencies to get their data
transferred

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
so you need you get a very high transfer
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
you can go to
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
slide 19 that's just a pictorial of
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
the frequencies that these different
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
bands are located in
 
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
bands are located in
the

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
low band
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh mid-band and high band
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
they still
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
set well below
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
um ionizing radiation or
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
where you get to uv light and higher
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a pretty important
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh point to any
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
person looking looking at physical
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
effects because
 
01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
effects because
the

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
signals sent from any of these bands
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the energy to ionize they
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the energy to create
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
to break down
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
anything like dna or any
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
cells or chemicals
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
which obviously is very important
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
because those are the ones
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
those breakdowns are the ones that
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
start to cause some of the diseases
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
small cells are
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
something that are a little bit newer um
 
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.270 align:start position:0%
something that are a little bit newer um
we're

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
all familiar for many years with the
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
very high cell towers
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the cell cells that are on top of
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
big buildings
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
that cover wide areas
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
but as you saw with the different
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
frequencies some of them don't travel as
 
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
frequencies some of them don't travel as
far

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
so you have to be able to
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
um put more cells in and those are
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
called small cells
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
in order to get
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
the signal to travel in sufficient
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
strength to be used by the people in
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
another thing that small cells do which
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
existed before
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
was to fill in gaps let's say you have a
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
high cell tower but
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's a big building that makes a
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
shadow that the people on the other side
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
of that building can't get any service
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
so you could put a small cell in that
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
building that would just
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:56.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
small cell is also good for providing
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
more high speed data
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
in a in a small cell you have fewer
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
people that are being serviced so
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
the sharing of the data that's going
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
over those frequencies is less so each
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
person gets more
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
if there are more users in a service
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
area than can be handled
 
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
area than can be handled
so

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
say in a city region a very dense city
 
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
say in a city region a very dense city
where

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
where
a

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
high cell
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
just has so many people in its area that
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
they they can't share those frequencies
 
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
they they can't share those frequencies
adequately

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
then you can
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
supplement it by adding small cells that
 
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.029 align:start position:0%
supplement it by adding small cells that
will

01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
and of course as i said previously when
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
you get get up to millimeter waves
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
and you have very high data rates the
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
signals just can't travel far enough to
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
be effective
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
so you need a small cell
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
to be close to the people that are using
 
01:05:57.039 --> 01:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
to be close to the people that are using
it

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
now one thing that
 
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.069 align:start position:0%
now one thing that
um

01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
with with these increasing frequencies
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages that we
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh realized
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
is that we could make smarter antennas
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
antennas that point right to where
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're talking
 
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.309 align:start position:0%
they're talking
and

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
give less
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
radiation to other people around it
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
not that that radiation would be
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
dangerous but it just
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
is a more efficient way of transmitting
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have to use as much power
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
you can direct all the power at the
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
people that you're talking to
 
01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:39.589 align:start position:0%
people that you're talking to
so

01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
the going back like pre-cellular
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
antennas sent their signals in all
 
01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.789 align:start position:0%
antennas sent their signals in all
directions

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
directions
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i use the example of a whip antenna
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
on a police car
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
when that police car drives by
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
when it transmits its signal is going
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
so no matter where you stand on that 360
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
degree circle
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
the newer antennas are called multiple
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
input multiple output or mimo
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
you may have heard that term
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
and they use lots and lots of different
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
antennas that are
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
phase related and that phasing of the
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
antennas allows them to direct beams
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
in different directions
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
which focuses the signal
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
what that gives is
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
more power
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the signal that
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the direction
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be to the cell phone
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
that is talking to it
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
and much less to people who are just
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
the major exposure is the person that's
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
communicating but because
 
01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.150 align:start position:0%
communicating but because
it

01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
jumps around that exposure doesn't last
 
01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
jumps around that exposure doesn't last
so

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
for a few milliseconds pointing to you
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
and then it'll jump over to someone else
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
and because the frequencies are very
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
high the data rates are very high
 
01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
high the data rates are very high
so

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
if your phone if you're talking into
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
your phone and this is happening
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
so fast that you don't realize it
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
it can buffer up or hold on to some of
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
your speech
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then dump all that at the very high
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
frequency over to the cell when the cell
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
is pointing at you
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
so it's not real time it's not
 
01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
so it's not real time it's not
hearing

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
always what you say as you say it
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
and again this is a
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
millisecond ranges so you don't realize
 
01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
millisecond ranges so you don't realize
this

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
this
but

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:49.829 align:start position:0%
but
it

01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
allows you to concentrate your energy
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
for very short time
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
to get all the data or the voice
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
information from a person that's talking
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then move on to the next person and
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
the next person and so on
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
and it moves around that way it's um
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's where the phrase multiple input
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
you know the advantage of that is that
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
other locations around that antenna
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
receive very little exposure
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
because it's only
 
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.829 align:start position:0%
because it's only
exposing

01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
exposing
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
what it who it needs to expose and then
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
only for a short time
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
whereas you know going back to the
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the old antennas like the whip antenna
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
on the police car
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's exposing lots of people that
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
technically don't need to be exposed
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the police cars talking in a direction
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
say toward the police station and
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
someone standing on the opposite side
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't really need to be exposed to
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
anything from that police car but that's
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
the way that technology works
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
so as a result those power levels have
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
to be much lower to make sure that no
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have another speaker that came here
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
specifically and i'd like to him as soon
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
as i can so if without uh objection if
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
you'd like to just continue here no
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
problem either way go ahead
 
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.669 align:start position:0%
problem either way go ahead
um

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
so the the mimo antennas work best at
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
higher frequencies and that's because of
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
the wavelengths um
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
not to get to engineering
 
01:10:52.159 --> 01:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
not to get to engineering
technical

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
technical
 
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
technical
uh

01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
at a higher frequency your antenna can
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
be smaller and you have
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
smaller antennas you can put lots of
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
them together and then you can phase
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
them so that you can direct the beam
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
so at mid band
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
the the mimo antennas have very few
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
elements because the wavelengths are
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
larger so they just can't fit as many
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the focused beam is fairly wide
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then as the frequency increases the
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
number of antenna elements can then
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
increase and
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
at millimeter wave antennas can have
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of elements and and the phrase
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
for that is massive mimo or little m
 
01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
for that is massive mimo or little m
mimo

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
mimo
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
when you see that
 
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
when you see that
they're

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
phasing the signal to each of those
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
elements differently so it
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
it generates a well focused
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
beam of radio frequencies
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that allows the small cells then to
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
decrease their power they don't need as
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
much power if they're not wasting it
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
going in other directions that aren't
 
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.830 align:start position:0%
going in other directions that aren't
needed

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
needed
and

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
they get the same coverage that way
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
and on the slide 23 there's a pictorial
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
of what i just described
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
um on the left
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a police car with a little
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
antenna on it and people
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
on a circle all around it are all
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
getting the same exposure
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
from that police car now that's i'm not
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
saying that's a problem
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
to the police car because they don't use
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
as much power
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not i'm not pointing that
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
out as a problem that's just an
 
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
out as a problem that's just an
inefficiency

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
inefficiency
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the mimo
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
antennas at mid-band
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
can't don't have as many elements so
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
they can't focus as effectively
 
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.390 align:start position:0%
they can't focus as effectively
and

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
but they point to a region
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
and that's an improvement certainly
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
so they can transmit less power because
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're it's all going into that region
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the right the massive mimo with lots
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
of elements
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
generate very narrow
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
fairly narrow beams
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
talking to each person
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
and ident just
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
for the graphic graphical purposes i use
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
the light pole because many of these
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
a millimeter wave is the highest
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
frequencies and the stuff that's new in
 
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.630 align:start position:0%
frequencies and the stuff that's new in
5g

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
5g
 
01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
5g
and

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh so it's new in 5g but is it really
 
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
uh so it's new in 5g but is it really
new

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
such that we don't know anything about
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
it and that answer to that is no
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
frequencies in the tens of gigahertz the
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves have not been used in
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
cellular telephony before
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
but they have been used by the military
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
for a very long time
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the safety standards have always
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
been developed with military input
 
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
been developed with military input
usually

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
they are the first ones out there to
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
work on the safety standards
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the research studies on millimeter wave
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
interactions have been performed for a
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
long time uh so in 1986 there was a
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.709 align:start position:0%
long time uh so in 1986 there was a
study

01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
but you might know the name gandhi from
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh las vegas
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
from the university of nevada
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh he and ryazi measured the penetration
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
depths for different frequencies and at
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
30 gigahertz is
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me which is one of the
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave frequencies being used
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
in 5g
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
he measured that the signal goes
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
penetrates about 0.8 millimeters into
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the skin so it doesn't go through your
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
whole body it gets stopped
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
that is one of the the features of well
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the feature but one of
 
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the feature but one of
these

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics of those high
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
frequencies that they don't penetrate as
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
well they get stopped by things
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
on slide 25
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
as the frequencies get higher they
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
approach the frequency of visible light
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
which is something that our bodies have
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
adapted to
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
so the frequency of red light which is
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
is about 10 000 times higher than the
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave frequencies that cell
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
phones are using
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
for comparison
 
01:15:21.679 --> 01:15:22.470 align:start position:0%
for comparison
those

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves are about ten thousand
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
times higher than am radio frequencies
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
so and also the exposure is very
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
different if you stand out in the full
 
01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
different if you stand out in the full
sun

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
sun
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
you get a higher exposure than
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave safety standards
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i i just threw in a little comment
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
make sure you wear your uv sunscreen
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
sunlight gets into ionizing radiation
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
which radio waves do not
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the uv
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
is part of the sunlight
 
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.950 align:start position:0%
is part of the sunlight
whereas

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
it certainly is not part of any anything
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that a cell cellular radio would send
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
um but by comparison the fcc millimeter
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
wave exposure limit is 10 milliwatts per
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
square centimeter and you can be exposed
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
to 100 milliwatts per square centimeter
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
10 times that
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
moving on to
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
slide 26
 
01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
slide 26
where

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
let me summarize
 
01:16:33.679 --> 01:16:34.390 align:start position:0%
let me summarize
so

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
after many years of use by the majority
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the people on the planet
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
cellular telephone use has not increased
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
5g introduces something new the
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave frequencies to cellular

telephony million millimeter waves have
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
been used by the military for many years
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
commissioned studies that have not shown
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
any damage to those

the safety standards that have proven to
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
be protective to society and by that i
 
01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.910 align:start position:0%
be protective to society and by that i
mean

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
mean

epidemiologically there's
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%

millimeter waves
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
in other words much less than you would
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
have received from standing out in the
 
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.910 align:start position:0%
have received from standing out in the
sun

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the

massive mimo antennas which are used for
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
these highest frequencies
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
greatly reduce the exposure to
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
bystanders from millimeter waves from
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
small cells they point right to who
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're talking to and they jump around
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
they don't spend much time because they
 
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.430 align:start position:0%
they don't spend much time because they
can

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
transmit data at such high rates and by
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
data i mean your voice becomes data when
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking into a phone so
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
your voice is part of the data or or if
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're using your phone for the internet
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that data is
 
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
whatever that data is
um

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
it gets packetized it gets put together
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and it's instead of real time it gets
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
dumped up to the cell
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
all at once
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
so it it doesn't have to point at you
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
on slide 27
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
as communications frequencies continue
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
so light is is also composed of
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic energy just like
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
cellular it's all electromagnetic energy
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
down to am radio all the way up into
 
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
down to am radio all the way up into
light

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
light
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave interactions with human
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
tissue are similar to that of light they
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't penetrate far below the upper
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
surface of the skin
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
and we're regularly exposed to much
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
higher levels from the sun
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
than are allowed from millimeter waves
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
and let me clarify something again
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're exposed to a lot more from the sun
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
than we are from a cellular tower
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the sun
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
has ionizing energy in it and that's why
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
you get a sunburn
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh you won't get a sunburn from anything
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
from your radio because there's no
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
ionizing energy you won't get cancer
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
from non-ionizing energy
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
fcc exposure limits
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
follow the safety standards that have
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the end of my formal
 
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the end of my formal
presentation

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
if there are any other questions i'll be
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for an excellent
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
presentation i i appreciate you coming
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
here and giving us this
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
very technical and interesting
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
dissertation on frequencies which i
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
think is very important to know anyway
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a time constraint in that
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
we have a person here that came this way
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'll allow me one or two quick questions
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
with some quick answers sure
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative platt thank you you
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
referred to the towers and you refer to
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
the low band towers being far apart and
 
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
the low band towers being far apart and
big

01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
then the mid band towers closer together
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
not doesn't have to be as big and the
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
high band towers have to be close but
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
fairly small you sell you use the term
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
cell would you consider sort of a cell
 
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
cell would you consider sort of a cell
phone

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh a uh
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
in other words you're talking to towers
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
but a cell phone also propagates does it
 
01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.430 align:start position:0%
but a cell phone also propagates does it
not

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
um the cell phone talks to the towers
 
01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
um the cell phone talks to the towers
yes

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
so so i mean we all have cell phones
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
most of us is there a problem there
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
um well i guess that's not really the
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
this point of discussion but those
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
things are studied together so
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is no there's not a problem
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
there because this the energy in the
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone is kept low enough
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
the last question represents here i'll
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
try to make this quick just one comment
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh you keep uh a number of times you
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
stressed on the military doing this in
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i've seen documents from the
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
military where people were actually able
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
to see the bones in their hands and
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
their arms because they're being exposed
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
to radiation uh when they were doing
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear testing in the in the 1950s so
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
now these militaries doesn't necessarily
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
warm up feeling there but i'm i want to
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
get back to this a linear knoll
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
threshold because you seem to be saying
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
no that doesn't apply if it's
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation there's no damage
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
then why are we spending so much time
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
covering the amount of exposure i mean
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
me tapping on the table here i can do it
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
for 50 years and my finger is not going
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
to go through it but why do i bother
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
keeping count of how many times i tap
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
then okay i'm sorry if i was unclear
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
that um there can be
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
damage from non-ionizing radiation
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's a different type
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's heat generated so if the non
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
if the non-ionizing radiation generates
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
too too much heat
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
it can damage your tissues and inside
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
your body is held to a very
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
tight uh temperature limit
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
this real quick so there is a limit but
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
we the debate is where that limit is yes
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
dr levin are you 11 are you
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh planning to leave right away or can
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
you stay for a while
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
can be here
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
early afternoon
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh then
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
if if if you don't mind standing by i'd
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
like to call up another
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh briefer and appreciate you coming by
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can have some more
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions for you later on
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
i have here uh mr james hancock who has
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
come here especially to speak and i i
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
know you have a time constraint so
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for being a little late but
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
my pleasure and uh i'm happy to be here
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
so whatever i can do to help
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm james hancock i'm from
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
chesterfield new hampshire i have
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
extensive background uh working with
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
cell phone companies uh and the
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
companies that produced the technology
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh that did dsl services and things like
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
this and uh you would think that cell
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
phone technology and dsl and network
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
cables uh and all these things and even
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
the light bulbs in a room
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh all are different well they're not
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
a really brilliant gentleman i can't
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
remember his name at the moment uh
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
developed a technology that creates a
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
wave that we think of a wave as a sine
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
wave right but what he actually
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
recognized is that the best way to block
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
against interference is to broadcast a
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
positive one and a negative one at the
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
same time so if we want to have an on a
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
binary we would broadcast both a
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
positive and a negative frequency
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the same thing okay and then if we
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to zero we would broadcast
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
nothing and you could go and use a
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
mathematical formula to eliminate all of
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
the interference in the air okay and
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
this technology is in your usb cable
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
that you use to plug in your phone or
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
plug your printer into your computer
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is in every single computer for
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
every single communication and every
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
single computer it's used it's called
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
pulse width modulation and various
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
different versions of it are used in
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
light bulbs so every one of these leds
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
uses tiny amounts of voltage but to get
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
that tiny amount of voltage from the
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
wall socket it uses pulse width
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
modulation at kilohertz and even
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
megahertz to bring the voltage down
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
and to be able to provide you the light
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
you you receive with an led light bulb
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
so everywhere around us right now is
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
pulse width modulation and what 5g and
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
even 4g and 3g are is a version of
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
broadcasting both a positive and a
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
broadcasting both a positive and a
negative

01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
negative
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
frequency of radio waves
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
so that it can go and create this signal
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
as our steam guest before us talked
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
about he talked about memo and all these
 
01:25:04.719 --> 01:25:05.910 align:start position:0%
about he talked about memo and all these
things

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
those things are all great technologies
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
and they'll go to my second point in
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
this but really what we're fundamentally
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
talking about is pulse width modulation
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
literally every single thing that you
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
interact with in the world today that
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
isn't your oven
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
uses pulse width modulation if you have
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
a ground source heat pump or an air
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
source heat pump or an air conditioner
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
they're emitting
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
pulse width modulated waves and in fact
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
the fcc regulates those in exactly the
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
same way that they regulate your cell
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
phone and cell phone towers and in fact
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
if i take a frequency measuring device
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i hold it over as an example the
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
brick for your your laptop that you plug
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
into the wall that converts ac power to
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
dc i will get exactly the same type of
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
signal close to the power brick as i do
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
my cell phone
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it will look exactly the same if i
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
hook it up to an oscilloscope it will
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
look exactly the same
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay because there's no difference
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're literally all the same
 
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.229 align:start position:0%
they're literally all the same
technology

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay so it's very very important to
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
understand this and to understand that
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
when we actually look at 5g what 5g
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
actually is which is an encoding
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
standard it's how the the ones and zeros
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
are encoded it's not the frequencies it
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
on it's on the only difference between a
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
5g signal
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
and a 4g signal is how often it checks
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
for errors in the message
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
and they all they did was they delay the
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
number of error checks that occur in the
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
signal by 30
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
which increases the amount of bandwidth
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
in any given frequency by about 30
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
percent because they get rid of the
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
error checks real literally imagine say
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
making a sentence
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
and broadcasting across a string and you
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
want to say did you hear me right
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the person on the other end repeats
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
back what they heard
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's effectively what's happening and
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
the less you can do that while still
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
getting the signal across the faster you
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
can communicate information so when we
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
look at lte or 4g or 3g or even 2g
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay they're all broadcasting in exactly
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
they slightly change how the information
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
is grouped together within that pulse
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
width modulation
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they change how often it checks for
 
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
and they change how often it checks for
errors

01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
errors
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
but between 2g 3g 4g and 5g on the same
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
frequency there's no difference
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
and just as importantly you could put a
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
2g signal
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
in what our steam guest called
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
at very high frequencies 38 48 28 12
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
gigahertz you could easily broadcast 2g
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
in those frequencies there's no reason
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't except we've developed
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
much better ways of doing it so it's
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
more efficient to use 5g to in those
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
frequencies than it is to use 2g okay so
 
01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.229 align:start position:0%
frequencies than it is to use 2g okay so
and

01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
just as vitally if we look at
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
frequencies and this is the vital thing
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to understand in this
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
conversation is that as technology
 
01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.149 align:start position:0%
conversation is that as technology
improves

01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
improves
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
we broadcast less
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
we get quieter as a human race
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
specifically because our technology is
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
improved consider wmur that's
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
broadcasting right now
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
okay in the same frequencies that
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
t-mobile has 5g
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay and they're broadcasting a digital
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
television channel which uses pulse
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
width modulation which is just a variant
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
of lte at the time when it was developed
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's broadcasting right now right
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
at you using exactly the same technology
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
exactly the same wave in exactly the
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
same format because it's digital when
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
the digital transformation happened it's
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
broadcasting at 50 000 watts of power
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's 50 kilowatts
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
your cell phone in that same range is
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
less than one watt
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
one watt
 
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
one watt
okay

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
one okay so even
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
where 35 40 miles from from wmurrow's
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
tower you're still getting over a
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt of energy
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
in those same frequencies hitting your
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
body right now and it's at a frequency
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
that goes through walls
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay so it's hitting you right now and
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
by the way has been hitting you your
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
entire lives
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay with no change
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
did anybody care about the television
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
channel that was broadcasting or the
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
radio channels because radio has gone
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
digital so every single radio channel
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
has uses the side of their frequencies
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
they made their their regular analog
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
frequency for old radios uh sound worse
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
and they use the side frequencies for
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
digital well it made it vastly more uh
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
capable of hold carrying data
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
but its pulse width modulated data so
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
literally every single radio station in
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state is broadcasting at least a
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
carrier wave and most of the time
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting at least one
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
probably two
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
digital radio frequencies and they're
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
using exactly the same technology as
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
cell phone service does to do it and
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting at 50 000 watts
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
on average there's a few that are lower
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay but that's coming into you all the
 
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.390 align:start position:0%
okay but that's coming into you all the
time

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
now how many have heard about starlink
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
elon musk starlink from spacex i think
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
everybody right
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
starlink is in 12 gigahertz
 
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.709 align:start position:0%
starlink is in 12 gigahertz
okay

01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
so with the exception of millimeter wave
 
01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
so with the exception of millimeter wave
5g

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
5g
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
that is vastly higher frequency than all
 
01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:21.270 align:start position:0%
that is vastly higher frequency than all
other

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone communication we're talking
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
just recently the fcc just approved 3.5
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
gigahertz for cell phone service okay so
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking at least three times more
 
01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:32.709 align:start position:0%
we're talking at least three times more
higher

01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
well right now concord where we're
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
sitting is in serviced area by starlink
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
at 12 gigahertz and i just looked it up
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
before i got in here it's at 66 db which
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
works out to 4.16
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
kilowatts of power
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
broadcasting that's hitting us right now
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
so as soon as you go outside no matter
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
what this committee does
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
no matter what any actions are taken
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
here because you have no control over
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
starlink you're getting orders of
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
magnitude more radiation hitting you
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
from the starlink satellites than you
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
are from any cell phone or any cell
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
phone tower because an average cell
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
phone tower in the united states
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
broadcast between 100 and 300 watts and
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's really rare to see any one of them
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
over 200 watts and
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about millimeter wave
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
they're less than half of that
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
so the higher the frequency according to
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
the fcc regulations the lower the
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
broadcast power so if i'm in
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
low band okay 700 megahertz 800 900
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
megahertz we're talking one to two watts
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm in mid band so 1700 megahertz to
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
about 26 2700 megahertz typically
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes up to three depending on who
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
you talk to we're talking a half a watt
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
of power that your cell phone's
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
broadcasting okay and the telephone
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
towers broadcast at half the power
 
01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
towers broadcast at half the power
because

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
they understand that the higher the
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
frequency the lower the power level has
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
to be so when we go and put those
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in perspective because just
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
above elon musk's starlink
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
is a form of phased pwm
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
used by noaa for weather satellites
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting down on you and
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting at 15 times more
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
power than starlink does
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
on your bodies and have been since 1979.
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
the world gets a massive benefit from
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
those towers those satellites because we
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
know when a hurricane's going to hit we
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
didn't know these things before unless
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
somebody flew a plane and happened to
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
spot one and could report it but we have
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
these things now and we have it because
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
of this technology which is pulse width
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
modulation so
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
the the key here is is that everything
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the entire world i mean i don't know
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether any of you saw uh what's called
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
the current wars the movie between the
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
war between tesla and edison between ac
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
and dc power
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
everybody says that tesla won that war
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
because ac one
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
except actually he won a battle
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
the entire world is dc literally
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
everything in this room if it consumes
 
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
everything in this room if it consumes
electricity

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
is dc power and dc power is run off
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
pulse width modulation
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
every single thing we do uses exactly
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing so there have been claims
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
to this committee in the past that i've
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
heard they're disingenuous saying that
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
5g is different than lte or 2g or
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
different than a network cable it's not
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're identical okay and i'll stress
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
that there's been claims that well we
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
could ban 5g
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
um because it really just uses lte for
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
its sending of data anyway so it doesn't
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
matter that's not true anymore
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
t-mobile's already turned on uh
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
stand-alone 5g which means that
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
and it's all over the state already by
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
the way you can go to cellmapper.net and
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
you can go and look at t-mobile's
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
coverage for for
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and there's 5g all over
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
the state and it's standalone it does
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
not use lte
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
lte will be phased out within the next
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
six or seven years because it's not like
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
2g it's not a foundational protocol that
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
requires voice
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the reason why 2g stayed around so
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
long is because we didn't have a way of
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually sending voice communication
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
over 3g so it skipped an entire
 
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.950 align:start position:0%
over 3g so it skipped an entire
progression

01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
progression
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
before it got to lte and we could do
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
voice over lte so we had to when we were
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
3g you had to have 2g still
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it lasted from the mid 1990s all the
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
way to this year
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
but that won't happen with lte we're
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
talking five to seven years at most
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
before they start decommissioning lte
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
because there's simply no reason to
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
because 5g handles voice and it's
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
completely standalone so if you ban 5g
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're banning the future of the of cell
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
phone technology and if you expect the
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
cell phone companies to expend the money
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to support legacy
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
technology that likely won't even be
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
built within the next 10 years they
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
won't actually build lte radios
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
then you're going to send new hampshire
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
back into the stone age very very
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
quickly as as the broadcast towers stop
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
working and the cell phones stop
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
supporting lte so it's just a matter of
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
time before a decision made
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
based on false assertions
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
is going to cost new hampshire
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
technology and a technology lead and all
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the things that come with technology
 
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.870 align:start position:0%
of the things that come with technology
but

01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
the the key point here and we going back
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
to wmur as an example
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay we watch tv over the airwaves at 50
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
000 watts
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
we watched their digital television at
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
50 000 watts
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
now on our cell phones with a half a
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
watt in our pocket and less than 200
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
watts at the cell phone tower that's at
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
a distance
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're watching television you can watch
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
wmur on your cell phone over your lte
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and 5g connection at thousands of times
 
01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.709 align:start position:0%
and 5g connection at thousands of times
less

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
radiation hitting your body
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay this is true throughout history so
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
most people don't realize this but when
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
spot nick went up
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
it broadcast at like 5 000 megawatts of
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
power to get a single signal through
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay so the history of human endeavor to
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
do with radios is to make them more
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and less radiating
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
everything gets less and less radiating
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
and more and more quiet
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
so if you ban this technology
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're literally stopping the very thing
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is going to actually improve the
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
health of people if you were to believe
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
that there's actually something wrong
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
with the technology and that's dangerous
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're literally banning the technology
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
that lessens the amount of radiation
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
you're receiving from these devices
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're not actually stopping the
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
radiation they're just going to use the
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
more radiative version of the old
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
technology and as our steam member said
 
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.430 align:start position:0%
technology and as our steam member said
nemo

01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
nemo
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
limits your radiation even more
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
it makes it even more efficient and it
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
has less and the one last thing that i'd
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
like to mention so everybody asks well
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
these radio waves they do generate
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
radiation uh and they they do cause a
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
side effect of heat that was just the
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
question it was asked this is an
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
important thing to talk about
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
think of a bucket of water
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
or a pot of water on your stove right my
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
my wife my daughter who's watching us
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
they were just talking about this the
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
other day they were talking about why is
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
the pot not boiling over
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
right and my wife says it's because she
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
turned the temperature down
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay so she reached an equilibrium where
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
it was boiling but it was not boiling
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
all over the place okay
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
the important part there is that our
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
bodies and everything around us
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
radiate heat at a specific level well
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
the fcc knows exactly what that is the
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
fda knows exactly what those numbers are
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
with specificity in every single human
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
body okay so all of the input that goes
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
in with the energy of these waves that
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
generate heat
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
it would have to be higher than what our
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
bodies can radiate that heat back out at
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
to actually cause damage from the heat
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't cause damage from the actual
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
radio waves because the universe has
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
been spewing radio waves in exactly
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
these frequencies and continues to do so
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
at multiple levels higher than what we
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
have today
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
the key is it would have to broadcast it
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and generate so much focused energy in a
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
specific spot where it actually heated
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
your skin faster than your skin could
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
radiate the heat
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
right so if you've ever gotten a sunburn
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
when you burn your skin's really hot
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
well a large part of a sunburn is
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
actually caused by the fact that the
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
solar rays the
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet is so powerful that it's
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
super heating your skin
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
and your skin can't release the heat so
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
most of the damage most of the peeling
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
from a sunburn actually happens as a
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
result of the fact that your skin gets
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
so heated so quickly by those radio
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
waves the light waves that are hitting
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
you that it causes the damage it isn't
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually the uv that's causing that the
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
uv breaks apart dna but it's actually
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
the heat generated that causes
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
everything that we normally associate
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
with with a sunburn okay so it's exactly
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing with radio waves the
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
difference is is that at the levels
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it's 10 times less
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
than what the equilibrium point is
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay so if you think about this right so
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
if you've got your your oven in it or
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
your your stove top and it's got to dial
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
to 10
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay and let's say seven is where it
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
keeps boiling but it doesn't boil over
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if you went to eight it would boil
 
01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:21.669 align:start position:0%
and if you went to eight it would boil
over

01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
your and you equate this to your cell
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
phone it's on less than one
 
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
phone it's on less than one
okay

01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
less than one so the water isn't even
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting lukewarm
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
it would take over two hours of you on
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
your phone with it pressed against your
 
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.750 align:start position:0%
your phone with it pressed against your
face

01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
face
 
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
before you would even notice any heat
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i guarantee most of the heat you
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
would notice is simply because the cell
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
phone itself trapped the heat against
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
your skin that your body was already
 
01:39:44.159 --> 01:39:45.350 align:start position:0%
your skin that your body was already
radiating

01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
radiating
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay so it's vitally important to
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
understand these things
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
and it's vitally under important to
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
understand that the technology behind 5g
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
is no different than the technology
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
behind 4g and everything that came
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
before there's nothing unique about it
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay so questions
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent kelly pitts
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
again with my very simplistic mind if
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
the technology is the same
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
why won't
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
some of the devices
 
01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.870 align:start position:0%
some of the devices
work

01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
right so they weren't designed for it so
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
um you there's there's a hardware and a
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
software component okay so if you look
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
at the way a radio is built you're
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
talking about a thing that's is
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
fluctuating millions of times a second
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay so if we go and look at a cell
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
phone it's fluctuating millions of times
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
a second and to do that they can't do it
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
in software to control it they have to
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
use a hardware algorithm okay so the
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
hardware itself generates the
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
fluctuations because the software can't
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
run fast enough to do it so if i was to
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
go and create a radio they're called
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
software to find radiators you can buy
 
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.149 align:start position:0%
software to find radiators you can buy
them

01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to go and generate an lte or
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
5g signal in lower mid band i can do
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
this you can buy these that are off the
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
shelf and you plug your computer in okay
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
your cell phone has a chip that uses a
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
few watts of power
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
that same software-defined radio doing
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
the work that your cell phone is doing
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
will use about a kilowatt of electricity
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
and require the very fastest computers
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh that you can buy from your local best
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
buy will barely be able to keep up with
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
the processing necessary to drive that
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
radio so each one of these cell phones
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
has a specific piece of hardware that
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
its only job is to actually control the
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
broadcast and reception of those signals
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it would generate
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
consume so much electricity nobody be
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
able to have them in their pockets
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's why the original bag phones were
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
so huge and they plugged into 12 volt
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they used to even pop the breakers
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
in your 12 volt cigarette lighter and
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
the reason why is because they were
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
right at the limit of the cigarette
 
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.709 align:start position:0%
right at the limit of the cigarette
lighters

01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
lighters
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
fuse because they were drawing so much
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
power to be able to process it well
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've gotten so much better at building
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
them in hardware that they're they use a
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
lot or less but the problem is is that
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
every single time you do that is
 
01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.030 align:start position:0%
every single time you do that is
specialized

01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
specialized
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
for the technology at that moment as
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
soon as a new technology comes out a new
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
frequency they have to go and build a
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
new specialized version that will handle
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
those new frequencies that's why they
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
become obsolete
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
and part of that's quite honestly they
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to sell you a new cell phone so
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
they will actually design the cell
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
phones in a specific way so that they
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
can apply that later okay
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
i can i follow it i just wanted to say
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
that my 1960s transistor radio works
 
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.830 align:start position:0%
that my 1960s transistor radio works
fine

01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
for now
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
for now until they turn off analog radio
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go with representative wiki
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh you talked about uh wmur transmitting
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
50 kilowatts and you said one kilowatt
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
would get to us now is that each of us
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
as an individual the whole city of
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
concord uh
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
it just uh it seems like an awful lot of
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
energy going into me if i'm getting a
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
whole kilowatt i'm gonna cook um so how
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
separate that out is uh so so power
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
levels over the air in open air with no
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
interference so no trees no walls
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
nothing uh it uses the inverse
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
proportion of square law okay so for
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
every meter because it's all in metric
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
for every meter the power will drop by
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
the square of the square root of the
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the frequency okay so i did a back in
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
the napkin calculation using an online
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
calculator i took three of them just so
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
i made sure that i wasn't using a wonky
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
one or something like that and i looked
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
at the distance from here there to here
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
from where the tower is and golf down to
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
here okay and came up with because it's
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
an omnidirectional antenna so if you go
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
and look at the fcc's diagrams for wmur
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
you'll see off the top of that big stick
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's broadcasting relatively evenly
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
relative to train
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
a signal that's in basically a circle
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay or a cone that shape that uh fires
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
downwards okay and that's true of every
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
single radio tower except for early am
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
radio that we're in a phase three three
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
tower array um
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're all basically omnidirectional as
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
said before okay so everybody's getting
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
an equal part of all of that radiation
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay um and it's hitting you and because
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's so low frequency it's going through
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
the walls and
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
the higher the frequency so if you
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
double the frequency it will penetrate a
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
solid object the same solid object half
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
as much okay yes there are details and i
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
apologize to the sinus in the room
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
because i'm simplifying but effectively
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
if you take the same piece of concrete
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
and double the frequency it will go half
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
as if it's far through or if it does go
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
through the concrete it will be half as
 
01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
through the concrete it will be half as
powerful

01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um where does the one
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
kilowatt go does it go to the whole city
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
of concord does it go to
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
you you said 50 kilowatts out that says
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
50 parts total there and then you said
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
something about one kilowatt i'm trying
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
to understand where that one kilowatt
 
01:44:56.719 --> 01:44:57.590 align:start position:0%
to understand where that one kilowatt
goes

01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
so concord based on its distance open
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
air directly from the tower we'll get
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
about one kilowatt right about here i
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
just took the middle of the state house
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay but if i was five miles down the
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
road it would be less than that
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
if i was in the lakes region it would be
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
ten times less than that
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay but if i'm in manchester
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's significantly more than a kilowatt
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the closer you are to the tower
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the stronger it is but interestingly
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
with towers they actually broadcast like
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
this so if you're standing at the base
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
of the wmur tower you're probably not
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
even going to be able to receive the
 
01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
even going to be able to receive the
channel

01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank you mr hanson for
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
teaching me how to write while you were
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
speaking at 5g speeds
 
01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
speaking at 5g speeds
sorry

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
i know you guys are packed so i try to
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
speed up so
 
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.229 align:start position:0%
speed up so
harrington

01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
01:45:52.239 --> 01:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
harrington
um

01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
i guess my question would be and i don't
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
know if you have any answer to this or
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
not but
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
it seems as if we're being inundated by
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
all types of radiation constantly uh of
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
all different frequencies and
 
01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.669 align:start position:0%
all different frequencies and
wavelengths

01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
wavelengths
 
01:46:05.679 --> 01:46:06.470 align:start position:0%
wavelengths
and

01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
now we're trying to hone in on this one
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
particular thing cell phones is it did
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
you have any concept of percentage-wise
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
in other words if we were to make cell
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
phones go away completely
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
how much would that reduce the overall
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh radiation burden that we're absorbing
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh as people would that be
 
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
uh as people would that be
10

01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.390 align:start position:0%

50
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
2 any ideas i can't give you an exact
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
number but
 
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.830 align:start position:0%
number but
um

01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking like one one trillionth of
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
with the majority of that coming from
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
the sun i'm assuming the sun cosmic
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
radiation x-rays
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know if a supernova goes off
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and when it hits the earth you'll get a
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
hundred million times more radiation
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
than you will in your entire life
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise as an example so
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you take all of those sources and
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
then you take
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
natural radiation sources all over the
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
globe that happen lightning strikes even
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
friction in the air is generating radio
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
frequencies when you take the totality
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
plus all of the other noise that we have
 
01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
plus all of the other noise that we have
from

01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors
 
01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:17.670 align:start position:0%
you name it even coal
 
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
you name it even coal
[Music]

01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
fire plants will generate radiation
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's a pet peeve of mine they actually
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
can be they can emit more radiation than
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
a nuclear plant can legally admit but
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's another issue exactly right if
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
you take in the totality of everything
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's going on it's minuscule because
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
just consider the number of computers
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are in this building
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay and they're they're
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're sitting right beside it you're
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of a screen probably
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
this far away if you just consider
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's broadcasting more radiation than
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
your cell phone is
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay so you know and yes
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
you have to be specific that those are
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
different types
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that might be x-rays and
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
they might be uv ray maybe visible light
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
and stuff like this but we're talking
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
about the most safe type of radiation
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay we're talking about the least
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
damaging radiation that a hundred plus
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
years of evidence proves i mean ben
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
franklin was literally doing experiments
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
on this stuff okay so we've had a lot of
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
experience with this and there's no
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
evidence that this isn't the most safe
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
form of radiation that you can
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
experience a quick follow-up
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
um i know you're not a medical doctor
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
but you've obviously been associated
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the cell phone and radiation for
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
quite some time you know we have people
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
coming in here telling us
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's safe if you stay below
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
these limits it's you know 50 times less
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
than anything that's going to hurt you
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera that we get other
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
people coming in and saying i'm sick
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
from cell phone towers do you have any
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
plausible is there an explanation of
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
that have you heard anything that would
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh lead us to understand why certain
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
people at least believe they're very
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
sick because of this so first of all i
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
hold five patents in epidemiology i
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
wrote the software that's used for all
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
distributed epidemiology in the united
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
states through the fda through the
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
sentinel program you can look me up i
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
stand corrected you much more qualified
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
to answer the question than i thought so
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
by all means do i i am not a medical
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
doctor i am a statistician okay and i've
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
written statistical analysis that goes
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
directly to epidemiology um so one there
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's two issues when you look at
 
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
there's two issues when you look at
statistics

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
that really throw people for a loop and
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use an example i'm going to
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
use the dirty word in the room it's
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
called ivermectin
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
when we look at the studies that have
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
been done on ivermectin the reason why
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
you'll find 15 studies and i'll draw 15
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
separate conclusions
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
is specifically because of what's called
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
a multivariant problem
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing occurs with vitamin d
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay so you have to control for all the
 
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.350 align:start position:0%
okay so you have to control for all the
variables

01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
variables
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay and when we're talking about
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
radiation it's effectively impossible so
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
if anybody's ever tried to uh go and
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
look at their vitamin numbers
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
all right they go and get a vitamin test
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
done to see exactly what their levels of
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
vitamin are
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
and then they try and modify their diet
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
to try and address those numbers and
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
they completely and utterly fail
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay and almost everybody does the
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
reason why is because there's so many
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
moving variables including even men's
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
time of the month will affect a male's
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
values for their vitamin deficiency or
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise okay even the time of day will
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
change those numbers so it's almost
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
impossible to control these things
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
because there are so many variables okay
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
so if i look at one study on on
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
radiation non-ionizing radiation and i
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
look at another one it could be
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know so as an example your microwave
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
uses 2.4 gigahertz which is right in the
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
middle of mid band it's broadcast in a
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
way like crazy right
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
well it boils water
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay so it has a deep effect on water
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a deep effect on
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
anything else because that's not the
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
harmonic frequency that if you vibrate
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
the thing at it won't boil water right
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
well but if i use 2.6 i could boil
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
something else you can literally
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
turn aluminum into liquid if you fire
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
the right radio waves at the right right
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
frequency and the right strength you can
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
literally melt it
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
right you can do the same thing with
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
mercury or any other element they all
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
have a sympathetic frequency so just
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
changing it slightly will change your
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
results they may not be meaningful but
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
they'll change your results and this is
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the important part of epidemiology is
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we look at the totality of the
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
evidence from multiple different levels
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
an average out and this is the same
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
thing in climate change data and other
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
other fields we try and average out the
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
noise to try and eliminate those false
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
positives and false negatives and it's
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
called the p rate okay so you'll see
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
this in in studies all the time they
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
call the it's called the p rate and
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's the uh estimation using a really
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
really really tight formula of how much
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
noise could be affecting
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
your results
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay if you look at the p rate of most
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
of these studies it is embarrassingly
 
01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:05.669 align:start position:0%
of these studies it is embarrassingly
low

01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay meaning that it is very very very
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
low confidence that there isn't other
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
noise in the numbers that's why you get
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
this and then you also win please
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
interrupt but i'm trying to get back to
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
the do you know of any reason these
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
people are not dealing with statistics
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with their health they
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
say i mean i've got a
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
piece here from a woman from my town who
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
says she has her blood treated and all
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
this other stuff she's run up 80 000
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
worth of bills and she claims it's all
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
because of exposure to cell towers and
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's why she moved is there any
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
can you know of of why these things are
 
01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
can you know of of why these things are
happening

01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
other than you know i don't think this
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
person's making up her illness but
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
is there anything out there that you've
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard of because you've obviously very
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
experienced in the field so there's no
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence anywhere and i
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
scoured before i
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
do this testimony and i
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
really really work hard to try and
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
understand all the perspectives on this
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
stuff there's no evidence of any
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
syndrome disease or otherwise of
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to radio frequencies okay
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
there however i will say
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
that you can't prove a negative okay so
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
all i can tell you is right now there's
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
no evidence of this occurring how and i
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
would make the point
 
01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
would make the point
that

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
these people have been exposed to these
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
exact frequencies
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
since the advent of television
 
01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.390 align:start position:0%
since the advent of television
okay

01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
if they were going to experience what
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing now
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
given that television is at as high
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
power if not higher
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the same thing with radio even
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
before that i mean marconi broadcast at
 
01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.310 align:start position:0%
before that i mean marconi broadcast at
megawatts

01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
megawatts
okay

01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
we would be seeing other people long
 
01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:48.790 align:start position:0%
we would be seeing other people long
before

01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
recent history have this my wife's a
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
behaviorist she does she's a director of
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
special ed we saw this with autism okay
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
so autism everybody thinks that autism
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
came about in 1992 or so it exploded
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not true we just
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
didn't diagnose it so we had a whole
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
pile of people that had autism we're
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
suffering in silence we have you know if
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
you go back and look at the behavior of
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
einstein newton um mary curie
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
they all had autism or at least
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
apparently did based on their behavior
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and comments that people made they
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
were never diagnosed it still existed
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay so we discovered that we weren't
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
treating autism and diagnosing autism
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
effectively so rates of autism went
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
through the roof okay but what we also
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
have discovered is that you can diagnose
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
autism at five months before any
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations have occurred
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i would draw a direct parallel to
 
01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.350 align:start position:0%
and i would draw a direct parallel to
that

01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
because we've we've confused correlation
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
with causation
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay and it's very important and i'm
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to everybody on these
 
01:54:54.239 --> 01:54:55.270 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to everybody on these
topics

01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
topics
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i would love for medical science to
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going on with these
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
people that do have these conditions
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
because we need to fix it but at the
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
same point we have to recognize that
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
correlation is not causation and we're
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
not controlling the variables so we
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
can't simply can't know
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
but all of the controlled data
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
says you know it's like it's like the
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
greenhouse effect
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
we know for a fact the greenhouse effect
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
exists because if you fill a fish tank
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
seal it and you fill it with co2
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
the fish tank will heat up faster than
 
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.430 align:start position:0%
the fish tank will heat up faster than
the

01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
tank that has regular oxygen in it we
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact okay but then you
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
put it in the wider systemic ecosystem
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden it becomes not
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
so clear it becomes much more difficult
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
to control and understand
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
right and that's why all the projections
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
are off so while these because we don't
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
know all of the things that are going on
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
all the inputs
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
but we do know that if you go and put a
 
01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
but we do know that if you go and put a
hand

01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a box that is sealed as a faraday
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
cage and you expose it to radio waves
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
below ionizing radiation you will not
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
see any dna damage no matter how long
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
you leave it in there at whatever rate
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
you want to broadcast it at you will not
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
see any dna damage whatsoever you will
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
see heat build up they will tell you
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
that their hands getting uncomfortable
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
because of the heat if you expose it to
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
their ears at specific frequencies they
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
will experience pain
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of doing that because
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a specific frequency that causes
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
your eardrum to vibrate and cause pain
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
but what it won't do is it will not
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
cause dna damage it will not cause your
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
cells to break down it will not cause
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
your red blood cells to deform or do any
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
of these other claims it just doesn't
 
01:56:34.159 --> 01:56:35.109 align:start position:0%
of these other claims it just doesn't
happen

01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:56:35.119 --> 01:56:35.910 align:start position:0%
happen
so

01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely probably something
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't understand that is
 
01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.350 align:start position:0%
that we don't understand that is
correlative

01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
correlative
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
to cell phones but not caused by cell
 
01:56:45.599 --> 01:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
to cell phones but not caused by cell
phones

01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i like to say a few words uh thank
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
you much for your presentation and i
 
01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.470 align:start position:0%
you much for your presentation and i
am

01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
am
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
thankful that you that you mentioned the
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
phrase correlation versus causation
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
because i think we've used that phrase
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
here often
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh obviously people are experiencing
 
01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.790 align:start position:0%
uh obviously people are experiencing
difficulties

01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.910 align:start position:0%
difficulties
um

01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
in certain areas that seem to correlate
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
with certain types of technology but
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
causation may still be up
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
up in the air
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
the bill that we
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
had before us here
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
had suggested that
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
a safe distance of i forget 1760 feet or
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:57:28.639 --> 01:57:29.830 align:start position:0%
something like that
16

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
16
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
1640 i'm sorry
 
01:57:32.719 --> 01:57:33.990 align:start position:0%
1640 i'm sorry
would

01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be an acceptable um
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
solution to uh
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
to help with some of these people's
 
01:57:40.719 --> 01:57:41.669 align:start position:0%
to help with some of these people's
issues

01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:57:41.679 --> 01:57:43.430 align:start position:0%
issues
um

01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
how what you're feeling uh would be of
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
that distance
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to get your thoughts on
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
that distance but also
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's maybe the very best way you can
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
build something and then maybe there's
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
something that will still work but maybe
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
give a little relief to someone else
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
even though it may or may not be the
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
cause for it so i guess i'll ask you the
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
same question is there anything with
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
this technology and i don't mean just
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
the new 5g but just anything
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
going up there
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
is there anything that could be
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
redesigned or repositioned in a way that
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
at least we might
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
say that we're attempting to mitigate
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
some of these people's issues that they
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
have even though we're not quite sure
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
what's causing
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
there is that on there we go um so
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
to answer your the first part of your
 
01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.830 align:start position:0%
to answer your the first part of your
question

01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
i understand exactly where the 1760 feet
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's what
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
500 meters or whatever the actual number
 
01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.109 align:start position:0%
500 meters or whatever the actual number
is

01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
rounded it i understand where that
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
number comes from it's using the inverse
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
square law that i uh used a little while
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
ago to come up with what what's the
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
dissipation in open air of these
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
frequencies that will get you to a
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
specific lower level okay
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'll note that millimeter waves don't
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
even go through glass okay so if you're
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
using a millimeter wave 5g signal and
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
you stand in front of that window
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
and there's one
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
and there was a light pole on that
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
street on the street right back here
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
that had a milliliter millimeter wave
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
broadcast your signal would be 95 less
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
just going through the glass
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
and if you walked
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
along the wall
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
it would be gone
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it would automatically fall back to
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
mid band and low band frequencies okay
 
01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:36.070 align:start position:0%
mid band and low band frequencies okay
so

01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
so it's dubious to me
 
01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.510 align:start position:0%
so it's dubious to me
that

01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
without outright banning millimeter wave
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
that number is meaningless because
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you can get 765 feet
 
01:59:47.679 --> 01:59:48.550 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you can get 765 feet
away

01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
where millimeter wave is actually going
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
to be useful
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay so literally if you go and put in
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
that limitation you're effectively
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
ending millimeter wave
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that you are going
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
to absolutely harm the least privilege
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
in our community by doing so because the
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
most cost effective way to deliver
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
internet and thus technology which is
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
the number one indicator for somebody
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
having access to being able to rise up
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the ladder in our society is having
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
access to information and education
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you go and ban this technology you're
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
banning the cheapest most affordable and
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
most accessible form of internet that we
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
have in the world
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay and even if you were to do so and
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna stress this because it's vital
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that starlink is literally
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
broadcasting it over your head right now
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
so the second you step outside and
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're not under a concrete wall
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're getting it so no amount of bands
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is going to stop that
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
because that's federal you can't stop it
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's been approved by the fcc
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
i it would be a token jester at best in
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to go and ban this because
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to happen and for
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
the record jeff bezos's competitor to
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
starlink uses 18 gigahertz even higher
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
frequency so if you think that well 12
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
gigahertz is okay but 18 isn't there's
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i did have a second part of the
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
question was
 
02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.550 align:start position:0%
question was
um

02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
is there anything that could be done
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
with insulation designs that could
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
pay homage to the fact that
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know a little further away
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
maybe vertical or horizontal whichever
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
way it is would any of that make any
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
difference at all or
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
be in any way
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
contributory to perhaps um
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
finding out if the people have a less of
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
an issue
so

02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's actually technology built in to
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
5g and lte which is nemo which we we
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
talked about so you're effectively and
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
cumulatively getting about 1
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
10 24th
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
the power so 1 1000 and 24th the amount
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
of exposure in any given period of time
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
as a result of that technology because
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's the cycle frequency of 5g in
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
amiimo is is it will cycle and reframe
 
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
the antenna and rephrase the antenna
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
1024 times a second
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
okay and they're the second generation
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
of 5g which will just be continually
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
added onto and your phone will likely
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
have to be replaced um when they go and
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
add that on the next version quadruples
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
that to 4096. okay so you're going to
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
get less and less radiation as 5g
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
continues to develop because
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
memo is the number one way that they
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of bandwidth that
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
they have in any given frequency range
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
so it is going to get better over the
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
lifespan so as an example lte has 23 i
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
believe different versions of it
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay and every single one of those got
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
better every single one of those use
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
less and less power 5g is going to do
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing we're on version
 
02:03:01.599 --> 02:03:03.109 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing we're on version
7.

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
7.
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's every reason to believe that
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be at least 20
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
variations of that before we get to 6g
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
so every single version of it will get
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
better okay but
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
the difference between vertical and
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
horizontal that you might hear about is
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
only the antenna okay so if you if you
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
have an antenna that's shaped vertically
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
okay it's not going to receive a
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
horizontal polarity properly because the
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
slits like this the radio waves like
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
this it can't fit
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
but if it's vertical like this and the
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
radio waves this way it can come in and
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
it will be amplified through the horn of
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
the receiver okay so if anybody's got a
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
radar detector you don't have to admit
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
it um but if you have a radar detector
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
this is out you can absolutely prove
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
this to yourself right now go find a
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
police officer friendly police officer
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's broadcasting on his radar gun and
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
just turn your radar detector sideways
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
the signal will drop in half
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
because police radar broadcasts
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
horizontally and if you turn it this way
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
it will
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
receive less than half because the
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
signal will be less uh it will not be
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
amplified as much through the feed horn
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay so the human body yes is vertical
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about waves that are
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
in centimeters and things like this
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
a millimeter wave is smaller than the
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
width of an average man
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh in signal strength and width versus
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
other ones like like
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
low band is is feet and meters wide
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
right and even longer so
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're still going to pick it up and
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any significant
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
large difference between it and it's
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
built the way it is because um
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
the the way it's designed maximizes the
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
coverage area at the at a given strength
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
so if you go and do anything else it's
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to be less efficient which is
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
going to mean you're going to either
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
have to increase the strength
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
or more likely you're going to have to
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
increase the number of towers to cover
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
the same number of people
 
02:04:56.079 --> 02:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
the same number of people
okay

02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative abrami
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair i have a couple of
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
questions so first um let's talk about
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that experiment
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked that well
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh that that some of the companies have
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
are thinking of banning or already
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
abandoned that strategy
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
because of like what you're saying it's
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's very low frequency it doesn't go
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
through walls very well
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's subject to interference trees
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
so is is that a true statement that is
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
that from your perspective has has that
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a failed the millimeter wave
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
concept and they've
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
by all indications the answer is yes um
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
to an extent so there are specific uses
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
there it's being used and i think it's
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
being used very effectively but if you
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
actually look at any of the cell phone
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
companies uh deployment they all have
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
maps on their website you can go and
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
look them up that show where their
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
millimeter coverage is they started mass
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
deployments in new york city and a few
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
other heavy urban populations um
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and they've all but stopped
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay there is some
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
new developments that are occurring that
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of that um are
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
really complex ways of broadcasting that
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
may change that
 
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that functionally
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to see massive widespread
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
distribution and honestly i don't even
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
know if there's anywhere in new
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire where it would actually make
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
monetary sense to deploy a millimeter
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
wave you might in like downtown concord
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
or um maybe in a shopping mall or let's
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
say in uh fisher cast stadium right
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
something like that that's where it
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
would make sense if you've got 30 000
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
people for a baseball game
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and it's all open air because
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's sitting in a stadium that's
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
an ideal spot to use millimeter wave
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay because you have so much bandwidth
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it's open air and there's nothing
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
obstructing you so you can directly fire
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the beam right at wherever the cell
 
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
phone is and it will just work okay but
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
in a city street even with mimo bouncing
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
off walls and things like this
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
it appears and obviously 18t verizon and
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
all the rest of them that might
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
come in here may disagree and they may
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
say that they're going to start new
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
deployments but
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
when you go and look at their maps and
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
you look at their applications for
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
deployment you're just not seeing it
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
like literally vermont goes and puts
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
every single one of their cell phone
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
towers is actually publicly available
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
online you can see the application for
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
them and they approve them at the state
 
02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
them and they approve them at the state
level

02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
so it actually creates an ideal
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
environment to you see exactly what's
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
being deployed
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
if you go through those filings which i
 
02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:34.069 align:start position:0%
if you go through those filings which i
have

02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
as far as i can find anywhere in any of
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
their documentation there are literally
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
zero cell phone towers in the entire
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
state of vermont even in burlington that
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
have deployed 5g uh millimeter wave
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you for that and as far as i
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
can tell here in new hampshire there are
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
zero as well right
 
02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:51.189 align:start position:0%
zero as well right
so

02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
one thing the 5g commission that i
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
showed again that
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
we concluded right early on that 5g is a
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
marketing concept
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
and that what we're really talking about
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
is radiation in general so we we kind of
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
morphed as a 5g commission to a
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
radiation commission if you will
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
so let me use your mur
 
02:08:12.159 --> 02:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
so let me use your mur
example

02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
so someone someone's not going to have
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
build a house run underneath that tower
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
now are they
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions and most of those are
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
actually to do with the tower falling
 
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.310 align:start position:0%
actually to do with the tower falling
down

02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
as to how far away from the tower the
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
towers have to be and it's mostly to do
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
with the risk of it getting hit by
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
lightning because it's a massive
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
lightning rod if the power is if the
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
pole is i don't know how those are
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
pretty high right those are yeah they
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
can be a thousand feet higher more but
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are people that live right beside
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
radio towers but power density i mean
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's all about power density i mean it's
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's the it's the watts per meter
 
02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's the it's the watts per meter
squared

02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
squared
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
i agree with you 100 on that
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
so if it's if it's broadcasting at
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
500 whatever you said 500 watts fifty
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
so how far away would it have to be safe
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
for someone to even be near it
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
underneath the antenna
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
underneath it the signal's so weak that
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's irrelevant because it's going that
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
way because it creates a cone if you're
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
underneath it like if you go and stand
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
right underneath the cell phone tower
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
just go find one you'll find that you
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
have very little signal off that tower
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
but as soon as you step out into the
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
cone it will get significantly stronger
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm not aware of the exact
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
fcc regulations but i can tell you that
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
there is very very limited little
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
limitations on how close to a tower you
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
can be because as an example before the
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
world trade center uh happened uh the
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
top of the world trade center had
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
literally every single television
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
channel in new york was broadcasting off
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
the top of the world trade center
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
they lost 90 of their cell phone
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
coverage for their backbone because
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
virtually all the low band frequency
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
coverage uh for new york city that would
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
get you into parking garages and things
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
like this was broadcasting off the world
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
trade center and literally there were
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
people inhabiting the floor immediately
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
below the tower right
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
so let's get back to the 500 meter um
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
we were looking for
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
a solution
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh and we we looked at the research out
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
there and yes there's research in this
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
research i agree with you on that
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
but it seemed like the studies that we
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
saw showed epidemiological studies i
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
mean that actual actual
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
cancers and things like that
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
that once you hit the around 500 meters
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be where
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know studies shown that the cancer
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
level off
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that that that was the basis of our
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
of our our conclusion
 
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
of our our conclusion
so

02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do here today is to
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
say is there an is there a compromise i
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
mean how how i mean i asked myself how
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
far away would i want to sell tower for
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
my forget about the 5g
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the small cell towers let's talk about
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
the big cell towers which have multiple
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
antennas on them by the way all
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
broadcasting at the same time
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
at very low wattage
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
that very low wattage
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
at 100 to 300 watts of power
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
there isn't a cell phone tower in the
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
united states that
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
broadcasts over a kilowatt right and
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
those are only in the in the midwest
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
where they cover hundreds of miles right
 
02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.709 align:start position:0%
where they cover hundreds of miles right
so

02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
how safe would you feel how you know
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
i've climbed towers that were active
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
to answer your questions but living but
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
living next to one is a different story
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean you you have a constant
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
buildup of exposure over time so no
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's not true let's let's be specific
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's exactly like my pot of water
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
boiling example
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
you have to have an excess amount of
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
energy more than whatever the body is
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
that it can radiate out
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
before you have any buildup at all
 
02:11:59.119 --> 02:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
before you have any buildup at all
okay

02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.709 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:00.719 --> 02:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
literally it's exactly the same thing as
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
if i boil that water if i can go to a
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
seven and i get a perfect boil and i go
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
to eight and it boils over if i stay at
 
02:12:10.719 --> 02:12:11.669 align:start position:0%
to eight and it boils over if i stay at
seven

02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
i've not i have no excess radiation and
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
no buildup because it's literally the
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
same thing we're just talking about heat
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
radiation it's a radio wave okay versus
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
a cell phone tower so until you get past
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
that tipping point
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
of radiation there is literally no build
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
up and in fact your body will radiate
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
out all of it back to zero
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it won't build up at all but you're
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
still talking about heat
 
02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:36.310 align:start position:0%
still talking about heat
but

02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
radio waves are the same thing
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
yeah but but there's but
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
but there are studies showing that
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's impact on dna
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
only in ionizing radiation above uv i
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't know i just talked about the
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
american toxicology program study
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
every single study of
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
this was a 30 million study by the
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
federal government right so i've i've
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
looked at all of these studies and maybe
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is a new one from the last time
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
that i spoke before this committee and
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
literally every single one of them was
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
either withdrawn or had significant
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
issues identified with it upon research
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
when i researched them okay every single
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
study that made a positive assertion
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
about correlation
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
and causation to radio waves and cancer
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
or any other dna damage okay there are
 
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:21.669 align:start position:0%
or any other dna damage okay there are
no

02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
studies by the fda and i understand
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
after the last few years that some
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
people may or may not put weight in that
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
but there are no accepted studies by the
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
fda that have not been withdrawn that
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
show that there is any possibility of
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
dna damage below ultraviolet
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
well again a year ago we had the
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
the folks who
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
were involved in the study that i was
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
just talking about
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
testifying to us right at that point
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
they didn't withdraw anything so i just
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
want to point that out go on to the
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
fda's website again if he does if he
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do studies does the fda accepts
 
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
the studies and they're there for this
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
purpose and there are multiple studies
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
and submissions and working groups
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
within the fda
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
on this exact topic so
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
well there are lots of studies that
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
suggest that there may be something
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
there are absolutely none that i am
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
aware of none that the who even admits
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay because they've studied this
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
backwards and forwards and have claimed
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
made these exact same same claims there
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
are no studies that even the who who is
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely obsessed with this admit show
 
02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
absolutely obsessed with this admit show
causality

02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
causality
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
well wh so causes it a uh
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
they call it as uh uh was that second
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
level carcinogen
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
group two b
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
probable but also the state of
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
california why would they do that why
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
would they do that hedging their bets
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
for exactly the same reason that the
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
state of california calls virtually
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
every single thing that is made by human
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
your best
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to ascribe motivation
 
02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
because i don't know their motivation
 
02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
but if you look in in california because
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
of prop 65 or whatever it is
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
basically every single thing that you
 
02:15:01.599 --> 02:15:02.390 align:start position:0%
basically every single thing that you
buy

02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
buy
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
shows a label on the bottom saying that
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
this has been is known by the state of
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
california to probably cause rape cancer
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
question one last question mr chair all
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
right me quick please okay
 
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
right me quick please okay
so

02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
is there any distance
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
that you would think would be reasonable
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
for setback on a cell tower from
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
someone's home or property
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
i would say whatever the
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
fcc regulations for risk of lightning
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
strike and towers falling is probably
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
also a reasonable setback and i'm sure
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
the fcc actually has a setback for how
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
close you can actually be i don't know
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what the regulation is
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
based on a given wattage i would say
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
that those regulations are based in
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
science based on safe testing that all
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
of the evidence shows this and even i'll
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
give you an example there was a claim
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago that police officers
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
were having higher levels of testicular
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
cancer because they were leaving their
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
radar guns and their laps turned on
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
turned out to be fiction they're
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
literally and and to be clear a radar
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
gun broadcast
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
well more than a cell phone tower does
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
and they were putting it in their laps
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
and that that same
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
study was withdrawn because they didn't
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
control it for all the variables so
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
literally a police officer putting us a
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
radar gun blasting away on his lap is
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
not causing cancer
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i would suggest that the fcc's
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
numbers are absolutely accurate and and
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
quite honestly very pessimistic why did
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
why do the firefighters in california
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
win their case
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
and there's no there's no towers on top
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the fire stations any longer in
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
california a legal verdict is not a
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
scientific verdict
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
there are countless cases of courts
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
ruling in favor of plaintiffs based on
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
an emotional response to horrific events
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
that had nothing to do with science
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
we we're into our lunch period here i'll
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
take one last question from
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki and i but before
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
how many other people are here that
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak today
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh we we will have another interim study
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
meeting but it won't be until the fall
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm just trying to get a judge for
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
for right now how many people want to
 
02:17:21.679 --> 02:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
for right now how many people want to
speak

02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we we can break for lunch and
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
let's have one last question and then we
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
can determine what time to expect from
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
lunch okay thank you mr chairman thank
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question returning to
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
the actual bill might not a standard
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
based upon street level exposure in
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
watts per square centimeter or any unit
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
of measurement be more sensible than
 
02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
of measurement be more sensible than
something

02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
arbitrary saying 500 meters for
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
everything because clearly a 2 watt
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
transmitter at
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
lamp post level is going to be a whole
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
lot less of an issue than a cell phone
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
tower doing hundreds of watts
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
the obvious number for that would
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
literally be the tipping point it's
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
exactly like the pot of water if the
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
water boils over you obviously have too
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
much radiation too much heat being
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
generated which can damage your skin
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
exactly like a sunburn where your skin
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
peels and things like this
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
so literally that would obviously be an
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
excellent limit to use as a measurement
 
02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:24.469 align:start position:0%
excellent limit to use as a measurement
scientifically

02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
scientifically
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
the good news is is that the fcc
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll break for lunch because we
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
have more speakers for this session and
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
we can come back here by quarter past
 
02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
we can come back here by quarter past
one

02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll finish up this
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
session before too long after that with
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
our additional speakers
 
03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh 20 past one so i guess we
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
can get going on this i understand that
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this next session in
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the form of a panel so
 
03:21:28.710 --> 03:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
if i'd like to have everyone's names it
 
03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
would be great for the record and for
 
03:21:32.630 --> 03:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
the clerk's enjoyment
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
you want to start searching
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'll start um i'm gary woods i'm a
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative from merrimack 23
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
serving beau and dunbarton
 
03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
i served on the 5g commission back in
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
the day
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit of my background the reason
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say some of the things i'm
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
going to say is
 
03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
i was originally a physicist
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and did work with quantum mechanics and
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
molecular orbital theory
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
relative to light and
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
molecular interactions
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
then did my graduate at berkeley
 
03:22:13.830 --> 03:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that little school on the west coast
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
and they did my graduate work at hopkins
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
before i went into medicine
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
and retired as an orthopedic hand
 
03:22:19.600 --> 03:22:20.790 align:start position:0%
and retired as an orthopedic hand
surgeon

03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
along the way i did serve on national
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
council for
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
scientific affairs for the ama
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
and have stayed involved with a lot of
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
physics and its relationship to medicine
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm ken chamberlain i too served on the
 
03:22:40.710 --> 03:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire commission
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
while i served on the commission i was
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
professor and chair in the department of
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
electrical and computer engineering at
 
03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
right now i'm working i've left the
 
03:22:51.990 --> 03:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
university i'm working as a founder in a
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
high tech startup company i think the
 
03:22:56.070 --> 03:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
message there is i'm very much in favor
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
of high tech and there's nothing that i
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
that would impair that
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
moving forward with high tech so
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
everything that we're going to be
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
can be done hand in hand with the
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
promotion of high tech
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's about all i have to say
 
03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:14.830 align:start position:0%
i think that's about all i have to say
about

03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:16.550 align:start position:0%
about
me

03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you dr chamberlain and he did also
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
serve on the new hampshire commission
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
that investigated this issue my name is
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
cecilia doucette from ashland
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i'm the director of
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for safe technology as
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
well as an international non-profit
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
called wireless education
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
like many of you i had no idea there was
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
anything to be concerned about with
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
biological effects of today's wireless
 
03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:42.150 align:start position:0%
biological effects of today's wireless
technology

03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
i ran many campaigns for our local
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
school district that helped us to bring
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
technology in
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
wireless infrastructure ipads
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
chromebooks smart boards minis
 
03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
and then one night a friend of mine
 
03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
who's an electrical engineer tipped me
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
off that there could be biological
 
03:23:59.279 --> 03:24:00.389 align:start position:0%
off that there could be biological
effects

03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
effects
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
i am a master's level technical and
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
professional writer
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
and so i began to do my own
 
03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
investigation into the science and i was
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
astounded to find literally thousands of
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies all over the world
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
showing that today's wireless technology
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
is indeed highly bio active and we
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
helped my public school district in
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
ashland massachusetts become the first
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
in the united states to begin taking
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
precautionary measures
 
03:24:31.510 --> 03:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
with radio frequency so today's message
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
is certainly not no technology but now
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
that we have the science showing it is
 
03:24:39.910 --> 03:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily biologically active it's
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
time to bring the pendulum back into the
 
03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
center and learn how to deploy today's
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
technology safely

03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
1644
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
is a really wonderful start to that i
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
would like to correct something in the
 
03:24:57.190 --> 03:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
record that was stated earlier today in
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
that when you get to that 500 meter mark
 
03:25:00.990 --> 03:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
or 1
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
640 feet that that's where it it stops
 
03:25:07.349 --> 03:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's not that's where the slope begins
 
03:25:09.269 --> 03:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
to drop off
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
we don't catch up till death rates in
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
the regular population until double that
 
03:25:17.190 --> 03:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
amount at about a thousand meters so it
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
is it is already a compromise
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
a 500 meter setback when the science is
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
showing us that the death rates the
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
neurological impacts with sleep anxiety
 
03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:31.670 align:start position:0%
neurological impacts with sleep anxiety
depression

03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
depression
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
and other neurotoxicities are happening
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
well within that range
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is a panel so feel free to jump
 
03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
uh this is a panel so feel free to jump
into

03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
to state your next statement
 
03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
to state your next statement
okay

03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:53.349 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
so something that was stated earlier in
 
03:25:57.910 --> 03:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
earlier presentations is that science
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
does not show harm from a radiation
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
exposure at least not below 9i in
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
ionizing and non-thermal
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's not what we found on the
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
commission remember you formed the
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
commission the legislature formed the
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
commission to kind of figure out what's
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
going on because there's been a lot of
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
contradictory information out there
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
so the commission was formed to bring
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
together the right people with the right
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
expertise to really come up with a
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
definitive answer about what's going on
 
03:26:27.510 --> 03:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to radiation
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
so people were brought in like
 
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
physicians couple of physicians
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiology toxicologists physicists
 
03:26:36.150 --> 03:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
people with a background to understand
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on to be able to interpret
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the scientific literature and then come
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
up with a report
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
that says what's going on and we've done
 
03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:44.710 align:start position:0%
that says what's going on and we've done
that

03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
back in
 
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
2020 in november we released our report
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
and that reports pretty clear
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
that there is harm from
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
exposure to radiation from low-level
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
radiation like what you get from a cell
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
tower and like what you get from your
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
cell phone we didn't make a distinction
 
03:27:04.710 --> 03:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
between 5g and 4g because what we found
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
is that radiation from any of these
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
sources particularly digital radiation
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
has roughly the same effect and we can
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
talk more about that in a moment because
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
that effect has been documented many
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
many times but what i wanted to talk
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
about was how do we know that and this
 
03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
is something that of course is very
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
important how did you come to your
 
03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:25.429 align:start position:0%
important how did you come to your
conclusions

03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
conclusions
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
well we brought in experts is one thing
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
and so we brought in nine experts with
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
backgrounds related to cell phone
 
03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
radiation exposure radiation exposure
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
period and health
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
and all of those nine experts except one
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
told us about the dangers of cell phone
 
03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:43.110 align:start position:0%
told us about the dangers of cell phone
radiation

03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
in in you know in very clear terms the
 
03:27:45.760 --> 03:27:46.630 align:start position:0%
in in you know in very clear terms the
one

03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
outside expert that we brought in that
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
said that there's no harm associated
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
with radiation exposure
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
was a representative from the cell phone
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
industry and the only paid person all
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
the other experts that came in and
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
talked to us were volunteers and this is
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
the only paid person and the paid person
 
03:28:04.870 --> 03:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
the owner who said that there is no harm
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
associated with exposure
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
so going back and i'm sorry to be going
 
03:28:11.190 --> 03:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
on and on about this but it's important
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
i was listening you know to what people
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
were saying earlier and i just totally
 
03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:16.150 align:start position:0%
were saying earlier and i just totally
disagree

03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
because the science is crystal clear why
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
else would a group like the the new
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire commission you that was
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
convened by the legislature why would we
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
come up with some statement about harm
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
when there is no harm
 
03:28:29.670 --> 03:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
none of us were getting paid and none of
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
us are affiliated uh i mean all the
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
signers of the majority report i should
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
say are not affiliated with the cell
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
industry so why would we come up saying
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that there's harm when there is no harm
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
and how did we come up to that
 
03:28:41.359 --> 03:28:42.710 align:start position:0%
and how did we come up to that
conclusion

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
well the first thing i did uh when i was
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
appointed to the commission is i started
 
03:28:47.279 --> 03:28:48.229 align:start position:0%
appointed to the commission is i started
reading

03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
reading
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
i went to the peer-reviewed journals
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
and started reading and by the way one
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
reason one function i performed on the
 
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
commission was to help vet the the
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
referee journals when you'll hear from
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
the cell industry that the only issues
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
or only articles that show harm are
 
03:29:06.309 --> 03:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
those from fringe journals and they're
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
cherry picked so one function i
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
performed was to vet those articles
 
03:29:13.190 --> 03:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
because i was an associate editor for
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
ieee transactions
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
in a prestigious journal so what i did
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
when i first started finding articles
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
showing harm i got together with our
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
college uh librarian you know phd and
 
03:29:27.510 --> 03:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
library sciences to say hey are these
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
fringe journals how could we how can we
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
refi identify a friend's journal what
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
are they all about
 
03:29:34.870 --> 03:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
well so what we did is we found the
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
articles that made these claims very
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
strong claims about harm associated with
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
radiation exposure and started looking
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
at those journals are is this a fringe
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
journal and the answer
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
just saying it very quickly is no high
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
quality journals with people from
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
recognized universities making claims
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
about the harm there are no fringe
 
03:29:55.439 --> 03:29:56.550 align:start position:0%
about the harm there are no fringe
journals

03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
journals
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are friends journals but we did
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
not use fringe journals we use high
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
quality journals in coming to our
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions now the other thing
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
they claim is that we do cherry picking
 
03:30:08.229 --> 03:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
but let's look at that let's look at the
 
03:30:08.239 --> 03:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
but let's look at that let's look at the
numbers

03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
back in 2010
 
03:30:11.279 --> 03:30:12.229 align:start position:0%
back in 2010
fully

03:30:12.229 --> 03:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
fully
 
03:30:15.750 --> 03:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
28 percent of the articles
 
03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
about radiation harm 28 percent of them
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
from the under industry funded studies
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
showed harm so only 28 of
 
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
industry-funded studies showed harm in
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
2010 now to me that would be a concern
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
but apparently to industry it wasn't but
 
03:30:33.510 --> 03:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
in that same year
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh fully 60 it was over 60 of
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
non-industry funded studies showed harm
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing a pattern there but now
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
let's fast forward to 2020
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
and in that year over 90 percent of
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
studies performed by anybody showed
 
03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
oxidative stress as being associated
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
with exposure to fields
 
03:30:54.960 --> 03:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
with exposure to fields
now

03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
oxidative stress that has to do with
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
free radicals many of you have heard of
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
them oxidative stress
 
03:31:04.870 --> 03:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
oxidative stress leads to inflammation
 
03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
which leads to cancer so there is a
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
well-known mechanism that is shown in
 
03:31:12.070 --> 03:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of papers well over the
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
majority of scientific papers so this
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
isn't just something obscure that we're
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
making up no we have hard science
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
showing this to be the case
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
either if you want to take it from there
 
03:31:24.880 --> 03:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
either if you want to take it from there
well

03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have to
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
bear with me i'm going to try and
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
explain a couple of basic physics
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
principles and terms that will help you
 
03:31:41.429 --> 03:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
understand some of the
 
03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
terms that have been used but also the
 
03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:44.550 align:start position:0%
terms that have been used but also the
implications

03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
implications
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
of some of the processes that are in
 
03:31:46.479 --> 03:31:48.070 align:start position:0%
of some of the processes that are in
place

03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
i again i would like to emphasize that
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
at no time
 
03:31:52.800 --> 03:31:53.590 align:start position:0%
at no time
have

03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion of being
 
03:31:55.520 --> 03:31:57.429 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion of being
anti-technology

03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
anti-technology
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's
 
03:31:59.120 --> 03:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's
the

03:31:59.830 --> 03:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
careful use of technology uh that we're
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
after uh and i emphasize again and again
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh having been in physics and medicine
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
technology is taking off at an
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
unbelievable rate
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
our social cultural parameters for which
 
03:32:18.389 --> 03:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
we deal with that
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
are coming along at a percolating pace
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're not able to keep up and we see
 
03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
that across the board another commission
 
03:32:28.150 --> 03:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm on fire on is the pfas or the
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
peripheral carbon
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
um again
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
teflon everybody loves technology teflon
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
but it's plefural carbons and look what
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with uh some of the
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
artificial turf is
 
03:32:44.790 --> 03:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh pfas uh and that leeches in so we're
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
but we're struggling with our technology
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
what do we do with it
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that requires us to think about
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
the science as well
 
03:32:52.319 --> 03:32:53.670 align:start position:0%
the science as well
um

03:32:53.670 --> 03:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
i would like to hit on a couple of
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
points one is the
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
pot of boiling water
 
03:33:03.389 --> 03:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
that's a good analogy for what's called
 
03:33:03.399 --> 03:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
that's a good analogy for what's called
macroscopic

03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
macroscopic
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
consideration in other words
 
03:33:08.710 --> 03:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
our size
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
except we're dealing with
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
interactions of
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
radiation at the micro
 
03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
radiation at the micro
level

03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
the physics is very different
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
at the micro level
 
03:33:20.560 --> 03:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
at the micro level
um

03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i the boiling pot uh is
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
water boils at 212
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean all molecules are
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
running around at the same rate some you
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
can see even are
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
going off
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
and some are not
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the temperature you measure is an
 
03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:42.710 align:start position:0%
the temperature you measure is an
average

03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
some are much hotter and
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
often they go into space
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
some are not
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what i mean by we're looking
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
at it by sticking the thermometer in the
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
boiling pot that's a macroscopic but we
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
know at the microscopic level things are
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
very different and that's we have to
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that that can rule the
 
03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:05.750 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that that can rule the
world

03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
world
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
just like we found like coveted 19 is
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
how big
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
and it's rule in the world
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
right now so the microscopic is really
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
crucially important for us
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the microscopic we have to
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
use terms like statistical
 
03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
use terms like statistical
thermodynamics

03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
thermodynamics
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
and we see that
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
happen even even with ice you put ice
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
out on the pavement even though it stays
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
below 32 degrees you come back in a few
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
days and the ice is gone
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
it sublimates because the activity
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
nothing sits still
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
even at zero things are moving around
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh and one second please the clerk has a
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
question i'm trying to clerk and use the
 
03:34:51.030 --> 03:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
word i didn't catch statistical what
 
03:34:53.190 --> 03:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
thermodynamics thank you though i heard
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
it that's okay sorry about that
 
03:34:55.439 --> 03:34:56.469 align:start position:0%
it that's okay sorry about that
um

03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
so even though it's below 32 degrees
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
there are certain molecules that are
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
moving faster and they pop off into the
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and eventually they all pop
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
off because their things are moving
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
around and they disappear
 
03:35:11.120 --> 03:35:12.070 align:start position:0%
around and they disappear
yes

03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
isn't that evaporation that that well
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
and it says it's called sublimation when
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's from the solid state
 
03:35:21.190 --> 03:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
into the gaseous phase
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's from a liquid
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
to the gaseous phase is evaporation
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay the same idea but yes
 
03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:30.309 align:start position:0%
okay the same idea but yes
that's

03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:35:30.319 --> 03:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
that's
um

03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is that the bonds
 
03:35:36.870 --> 03:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
that hold molecules together
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
in ice are broken
 
03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
in ice are broken
and

03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:41.040 --> 03:35:42.070 align:start position:0%
and
can

03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
disappear into the atmosphere
 
03:35:45.190 --> 03:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
sublimation or in the case of water
 
03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
sublimation or in the case of water
evaporation

03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
evaporation
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
so we have to make sure we focus on the
 
03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:51.429 align:start position:0%
so we have to make sure we focus on the
microscopic

03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
microscopic
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the term ionization is the next term i'd
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
like to address
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the role of ionization
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
is crucial for our bodies
 
03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:02.389 align:start position:0%
is crucial for our bodies
okay

03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
but our whole body is ionized
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
how do your nerves work
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
by transporting ions
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
across membranes potassium and sodium
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
ions are transported across membrane
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.389 --> 03:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
muscle contraction how do your muscles
 
03:36:24.399 --> 03:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
muscle contraction how do your muscles
work

03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
by controlling ions calcium ions in what
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
are called the lateral cisterni in a
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
sarcomere the little unit of your muscle
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
gets released that causes the
 
03:36:36.399 --> 03:36:37.830 align:start position:0%
gets released that causes the
contracture

03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
contracture
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
but that we're controlling ions
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
we love ions our whole body is on it how
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
do your bones grow
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
their bones grow because of what's
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
called piezoelectricity
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the bones bend and that causes a
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
change in the physical separation or in
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
a sense local ionization
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that stimulates the cells nearby
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
that sense that
 
03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
charge difference
 
03:37:07.510 --> 03:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
and they put down some calcium
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
our whole body's ionized
 
03:37:16.950 --> 03:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not ions themselves
 
03:37:19.030 --> 03:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's how they're misused
 
03:37:19.040 --> 03:37:23.269 align:start position:0%
it's how they're misused
okay

03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the last complicated term i'd like to
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
explain which has a significant
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
difference and i
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
actually did a lot of work in this area
 
03:37:34.469 --> 03:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
it's called proton tunneling and don't
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'll explain what that means
 
03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:38.710 align:start position:0%
i'll explain what that means
water

03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
is made of hydrogen which is basically a
 
03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
is made of hydrogen which is basically a
proton

03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
proton
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
and electrons basically okay
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
now when dna comes together we know how
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
dna is put together they're sort of like
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
fingers and there's hydrogens here
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
and they come together and they bond by
 
03:37:55.760 --> 03:37:56.830 align:start position:0%
and they come together and they bond by
hydrogen

03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
bonding okay
 
03:38:01.190 --> 03:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
hydrogen bond on one side of the dna
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
says i want the proton
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
the other side of the dna says no i want
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
the proton
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
and so this this proton is is caught in
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
between and there's called a potential
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
barrier in other words it's on this side
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
and it's there's a barrier like a wall
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
and the proton sits on one side of that
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
wall with one molecule
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
the other molecule here can't get it
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
because there's a wall there
 
03:38:26.399 --> 03:38:28.150 align:start position:0%
because there's a wall there
but

03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
in quantum mechanics
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's a certain probability
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
that that proton can sneak through the
 
03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:38.469 align:start position:0%
that that proton can sneak through the
wall

03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
wall
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
and get on the other side well what
 
03:38:42.790 --> 03:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
happens if that happens
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
well uh t
 
03:38:47.910 --> 03:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
then becomes an a when it's red
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
and a g
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
becomes a c
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
when that's red you go have an error
 
03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
well our bodies can control that to some
 
03:38:56.800 --> 03:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
well our bodies can control that to some
degree

03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
notice i said to some degree
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
but that can occur even at just room
 
03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:04.150 align:start position:0%
but that can occur even at just room
temperature

03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
temperature
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
that proton tunneling
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take a level of ionizing
 
03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:13.110 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take a level of ionizing
radiation

03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
to make that happen
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
that's at a very low level
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that was discussed
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
in a paper by a fellow named pair all of
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
louv dean in 1963
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
when i was a senior at berkeley
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i thought well that's pretty cool so
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
i began studying it myself
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
and he postulated back then because of
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
this proton tunneling that errors might
 
03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:38.309 align:start position:0%
this proton tunneling that errors might
occur

03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
occur
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
and indeed we know that that can be the
 
03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:41.910 align:start position:0%
and indeed we know that that can be the
case

03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
we know that these hydrogen bonds also
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
play not just in dna
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
but in almost every reaction in our body
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
our body is controlled by little gadgets
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
proteins called
 
03:39:55.760 --> 03:39:58.070 align:start position:0%
proteins called
enzymes

03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
enzymes
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
enzymes are collected into a mass
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
and their structure their
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
three-dimensional structure
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
is absolutely crucial
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the activity that they perform if
 
03:40:14.309 --> 03:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
that shape is changed
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
we have a problem
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
enzyme doesn't work
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
or it works in a way that's detrimental
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
again those are hydrogen bonds
 
03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that do that
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's that proton tunneling sneaking
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
up again
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
running through the tunnel
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
so dna
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
enzyme control
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the proteins
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that is a major factor and it is at a
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
level that is
 
03:40:42.319 --> 03:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
level that is
way

03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
down below the ionization level
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
lastly i would like to introduce you a
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
term called a superposition principle
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
some places would call it resonance
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
these activities working together
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay and it's very easy to an example
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
you have your grandchild actually
 
03:41:06.469 --> 03:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
grandkids because i do it with my
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
granddaughter all the time she likes to
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
be out on the swing
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
so what do you do you get behind the
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
swing you
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
push okay
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
comes back again a little bit of a push
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
you don't push very hard
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
but you keep the swing and even just a
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of extra goes higher
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
that means you're in sync
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay you're in resonance
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
now if you pushed when she was coming
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
back with the same force
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
she'd come to a stop
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
so you're
 
03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
so you're
out

03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
of resonance
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the same thing can happen inside
 
03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
and the same thing can happen inside
molecules

03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
molecules
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
this force
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
that force
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
that force come together and they're all
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
little forces but when they come
 
03:41:54.239 --> 03:41:55.269 align:start position:0%
little forces but when they come
together

03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh oh
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
big time
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
you run into some problem potentially
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
run into some problems
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
so much for the technical stuff but i
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
think these are issues
 
03:42:08.710 --> 03:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
that are crucially important and
 
03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
understanding not the macroscopic not
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
the boiling pot of water
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
but the actual interaction
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
at the molecular level which we know
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
happens and i hearken back as early as
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
1963 parallels ludene published a paper
 
03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
saying hey guys
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
this happens
 
03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
this happens
and

03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
i've tried to stay up with it since but
 
03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh sorry for the technical aspect i'll
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
um represent brummie yeah so so dr
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
what's you you're saying that
 
03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:43.750 align:start position:0%
what's you you're saying that
that

03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
that with enough radiation all around us
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
that the potential of the interaction of
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
that radiation with these mechanisms is
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
part of the issue
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely they can work together they
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to work independently
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
now they have the whole issue of what's
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
called super
 
03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:02.309 align:start position:0%
called super
superposition

03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
superposition
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's the basis of
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's the basis some of some of the
 
03:43:07.750 --> 03:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
more recent papers that are coming out
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
on this issue correct thank you
 
03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
on this issue correct thank you
remember

03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
i heard you listen to you
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
why what is different about 5g as
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to television that's causing uh
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
in your view any difference no we're not
 
03:43:26.469 --> 03:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
we as as was pointed out by
 
03:43:28.150 --> 03:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
the term 5g was used as a guidepost but
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
became very clear that we had to be
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
aware of all radiation and we did we
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
we looked at that so the the the issue
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
of 5g that it that its energy range
 
03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:45.510 align:start position:0%
of 5g that it that its energy range
is

03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
carries more energy than
 
03:43:49.750 --> 03:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
longer wavelength the shorter the
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
wavelength the higher the energy
 
03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
or frequency the wavelength and
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
frequency are sort of interchanged
 
03:43:57.279 --> 03:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
frequency are sort of interchanged
interchangeable

03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable
 
03:43:58.960 --> 03:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
interchangeable
but

03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:00.630 align:start position:0%
but
so

03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
once you get up into the higher
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
frequency range they carry more energy
 
03:44:06.550 --> 03:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's really the concern but
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't restrict ourselves just to
 
03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:10.349 align:start position:0%
we didn't restrict ourselves just to
that

03:44:10.349 --> 03:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.359 --> 03:44:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:15.359 --> 03:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
about

03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:18.389 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
four hours ago
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
i suggested
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
so if we have to shave
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we can't eliminate
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
i mean you you take people's cell phones
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
away you talk about revolution
 
03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
away you talk about revolution
um

03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
i mean that i'm serious and it also is
 
03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
what then
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
are we to do
 
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have to find ways such as having your
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
cell phone automatically stop radiating
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
when you're
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
not reusing it
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
and that can be done already with
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
technology on your cell phones you can
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
have it such you can pick when it's
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
radiating or not
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
um but id is like that so you you
 
03:45:11.910 --> 03:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
minimize it as much as you potentially
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
can being aware of these other factors
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that come into play but get industry on
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
board to help us
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh and diminish
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
both the intensity the frequency and the
 
03:45:24.479 --> 03:45:25.830 align:start position:0%
both the intensity the frequency and the
proximity

03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
proximity
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
with the radiation again it's smart
 
03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
usage not non-usage
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
so may i follow up
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
on on my particular cable box
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
i can
 
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
after a certain amount of time it'll
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
shut off
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
if i'm not watching it
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
does that save radiation by just
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
shutting it off
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes i mean the radiation that's going to
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
occur sure yeah if you shorten the time
 
03:45:54.150 --> 03:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes but if you just shut your phone off
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
does that
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because it's still
 
03:45:57.439 --> 03:45:58.630 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because it's still
receiving

03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
03:45:58.640 --> 03:45:59.349 align:start position:0%
receiving
uh

03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
yeah it's still interacting there's just
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
because you're not talking doesn't mean
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not interacting
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
so does that mean again with the
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
simplistic mind that i have and all my
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
chemistry and other classes that came
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
rolling back like a nightmare
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
do

03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's the proximity so what's right close
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
to us like this particular these things
 
03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
in here and his computer
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.920 --> 03:46:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
are

03:46:34.830 --> 03:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:46:39.269 --> 03:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
radiating but when we add something
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
bigger like
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
like a higher frequency like a 5g
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
does that do
 
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
more harm especially when we can get
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
away from it if we are sheltered we we
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that any that the
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
intensity and duration and proximity are
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
the things that increase the level of
 
03:46:58.399 --> 03:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
the things that increase the level of
harm

03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
harm
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
now we understand you can't get away
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
from all radiation okay cosmic rays are
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
coming through all the time okay
 
03:47:10.150 --> 03:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
now probably the biggest
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
particle you're subjected to is
 
03:47:11.760 --> 03:47:13.349 align:start position:0%
particle you're subjected to is
neutrinos

03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
neutrinos
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
probably on the order of 10 trillion to
 
03:47:19.349 --> 03:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
15 trillion per second penetrate your
 
03:47:19.359 --> 03:47:20.630 align:start position:0%
15 trillion per second penetrate your
body

03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
right now as you sit there
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
count up cow thousand one thousand
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
fifty ten to fifteen trillion neutrinos
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
went through your body while i said that
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
and that comes from primarily the sun
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
but i i we can't avoid all radiation
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
we have to live with it
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
and we want to take advantage of it to
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
our to to our advantage that's not the
 
03:47:47.199 --> 03:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
our to to our advantage that's not the
purpose

03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:47:51.750 --> 03:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
our purpose is to ask the question
 
03:47:51.760 --> 03:47:52.950 align:start position:0%
our purpose is to ask the question
okay

03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
are we doing harm if we find we're not
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay it's like i used to
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
tell my daughter they'd come and have
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
three daughters and
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
they'd come in and give me an argument
 
03:48:03.269 --> 03:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
about something i'd say great that
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
sounds pretty good
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
what about the other side
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
roll the eyes and
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
nothing happens and i said well you do
 
03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:13.349 align:start position:0%
nothing happens and i said well you do
know

03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
until you can argue both sides
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
you're prejudiced
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
now the side you are
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
arguing may be correct but if you can't
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
argue the other side what you are
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
arguing is a prejudiced position
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do here in the
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner we did
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
is to try and look
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
and be objective and ask ourselves
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
what where does this fall in the
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
spectrum of the rise of technology it's
 
03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.349 align:start position:0%
spectrum of the rise of technology it's
usefulness

03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
usefulness
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
versus its detraction
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a question we're trying to
 
03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:51.910 align:start position:0%
and that's a question we're trying to
address

03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
i will ask at the end the same question
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
i asked the previous speaker however
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these things
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know in terms of
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
resonance we're talking about
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
frequencies and one would think that
 
03:49:10.150 --> 03:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps the frequencies are critical and
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
some may be worse than others
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then the amount of power and it gets
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
back to
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
would it not make more sense rather than
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
saying 500 meters to say
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
watts per square centimeter or
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square centimeter
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
at street level or in residence nearby
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that would give us a
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps more difficult standard to
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
administer but it would give us a
 
03:49:34.960 --> 03:49:36.550 align:start position:0%
administer but it would give us a
reasonable

03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
thing to work with which would allow us
 
03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
thing to work with which would allow us
to

03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
use the prop technology as well as we
 
03:49:43.590 --> 03:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
can i would i was going to say i'm
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
getting a tap on my shoulder which i was
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to do anyway um the engineer here
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
will be much more facile so as i
 
03:49:56.389 --> 03:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned i am a radio oh sagan
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
all right clunk sorry about your ears so
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a radio frequency engineer and so
 
03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
come up with answers to questions like
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
this all the time
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
um so
um

03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually could you kind of rephrase it
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh basically what i'm saying is uh
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
would we not be better off with a
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
standard that uh tells us about a
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
particular you know radiation in terms
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
of watts or microwatts per square
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
centimeter and that would let us give a
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
variable position if we've got a 200
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
watt transmitter uh at street level that
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
might be a more serious issue than a two
 
03:50:45.429 --> 03:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
watt transmitter uh at tree level and so
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
using that standard are using a flexible
 
03:50:49.590 --> 03:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
standard that is watts per square
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
centimeter possibly with a frequency uh
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
variable involved also right thank you
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
for that question it's it's a good one
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's one that we discussed in the
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee as we were trying to figure
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
out what would be the best way to write
 
03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation yes that is what matters
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i know from somebody who's made a
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot of these measurements myself that i
 
03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
can have a tower and i can go a distance
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
away from that tower and i'll get one
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
reading and then i'll move a little
 
03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
distance and i'll get a very different
 
03:51:14.319 --> 03:51:15.429 align:start position:0%
distance and i'll get a very different
reading

03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
reading
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
so what you said earlier about that
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
being hard to enforce was exactly the
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
reason we came up with distance
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
so we looked into the referee journals
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
again and we found that there are
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
plots of how signal level drops off for
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
a typical
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
facility so if you take a typical cell
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
tower and you go
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
1 640 feet away from it you you reach a
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
level that has been identified by many
 
03:51:42.150 --> 03:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
as being an acceptable level and the
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
fact that also shows up that 500 meters
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
at 1 640 feet shows up in multiple
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
multiple studies i can think of at least
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
eight studies that recommend that as
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
being the criterion for distance away
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
from a cell tower so it's just
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward to implement
 
03:51:58.960 --> 03:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
straightforward to implement
and

03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
nobody can question whether or not it's
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
right because here's something else that
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
fits into that and that is signal level
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
can vary depending upon atmospheric
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
conditions so you might go 500 meters
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
away on a sunny day and get a very
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
different reading than you get on an
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
overcast day
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
so it just seemed like it was the most
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward approach to finding a
 
03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable and that's what we're looking
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
for is something that's reasonable and
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
protects most people
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lauder
 
03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:30.950 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lauder
please

03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
not her
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing i have all my
 
03:52:37.590 --> 03:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
notes from that one of the questions i
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
asked was have any states banned 5g and
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
the answer was no
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
so my question this time is have any
 
03:52:44.720 --> 03:52:47.030 align:start position:0%
so my question this time is have any
states

03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
implemented setting back
 
03:52:49.120 --> 03:52:50.630 align:start position:0%
implemented setting back
5g

03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
5g
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to move this around a
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
little bit without smashing your ears on
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
a state level no new hampshire is the
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
first to take this on there are
 
03:53:05.189 --> 03:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
communities that are banning 5g easton
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
connecticut for example there was a
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
grandmother there who figured out the
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
radio frequency biological effects she
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
brought this issue to her town leaders
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
they investigated and they put a
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
moratorium on 5g just this month they
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed that moratorium out to the
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
end of next year until it can be proven
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
biologically safe
 
03:53:29.110 --> 03:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
hawaii also had a ban on 5g on one of
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
their islands
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
in brussels and other areas around the
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
world we are seeing this happen
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
and if i could offer a suggestion
 
03:53:40.389 --> 03:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
what the world is starting to move
 
03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
toward for safe technology is fiber to
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
and through the premises
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
5g is powered with a backbone of fiber
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
optics that runs down the center of the
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
road and because it's
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
very much more inexpensive to just throw
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
up a small cell antenna off of that to
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
go the last however many feet into your
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
home or to the person walking on the
 
03:54:04.399 --> 03:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
home or to the person walking on the
ground

03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's where the wireless industry would
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
prefer to have us going is to put up all
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
these small cells and when they talk
 
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
about those millimeter waves not being
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
able to go very far
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
what that translates into is the
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
industry wants to put a cell tower
 
03:54:22.150 --> 03:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
every two to twelve houses
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
inside our neighborhoods there are
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
people all over the country in the world
 
03:54:29.189 --> 03:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
today waking up with a cell tower in
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
their front yard
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want to try and
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
prevent with the 500 meter setback that
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
is supported by the epidemiological and
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
the in vivo in the in vitro studies as
 
03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:40.790 align:start position:0%
the in vivo in the in vitro studies as
well

03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
as to where biological harm is happening
 
03:54:45.910 --> 03:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i know there was some confusion
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
about whether our earlier experts today
 
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
were current with their science
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
and when we heard from dr lapin he said
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
that their investigation concluded in
 
03:54:57.600 --> 03:54:59.429 align:start position:0%
that their investigation concluded in
2017

03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%

world's gold standard on toxics research
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
they went in 20 years ago expecting to
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
prove that cell phones and towers and so
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
forth are safe
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
they held an unprecedented three-day
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
peer review at the national institutes

effects of radio frequency
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
they weighed in and for three days they
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
talked about this report at the end of
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
the day and you can all get this right
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
online just go to the national
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%

at the end of the day
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
they concluded clear evidence of tumors
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the hearts and these were done on
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
rodents in the hearts of male rats these
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
were malignant schwannomas the schwann
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
cells are in the lining of the heart
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
evidence of tumors in the brains of the
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
rats and additional evidence of tumors
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the adrenal glands of male rats and
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
when we use that term clear evidence
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's the highest categorization they
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
can give so we now have conclusive
 
03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:27.189 align:start position:0%
can give so we now have conclusive
causation

03:56:27.189 --> 03:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
causation
 
03:56:29.189 --> 03:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
not just correlation
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
and as the industry is prone to do
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
they'll say oh that's just one study
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
well right on the heels of our
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
government again the world's gold
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
standard on toxic investigation after
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
they concluded clear evidence of dna
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
damage and cancers the ramazzini
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
institute in italy completed another
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
large study on cell phone base stations
 
03:56:53.670 --> 03:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
or cell towers that corroborated
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
everything that we found on the cell
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
phone study so we do not need more
 
03:57:00.790 --> 03:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
science science is always evolving we
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
can always improve on it but today
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
we have enough information to know
 
03:57:06.239 --> 03:57:07.349 align:start position:0%
we have enough information to know
better

03:57:07.349 --> 03:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
better

this document is the bio initiative
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
report and it compiles peer-reviewed
 
03:57:15.750 --> 03:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
published scientific literature from
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
around the world the actual
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
public document is about 1600 pages that
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
has summaries of all these scientists
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
scientific investigations but i will
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
just read to you from the table of
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
contents and this is what the science
 
03:57:30.880 --> 03:57:32.070 align:start position:0%
contents and this is what the science
today

03:57:32.070 --> 03:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
shows us
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
evidence for damage to sperm and
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
reproduction and when i started reading
 
03:57:40.150 --> 03:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
the reproduction studies that's the day
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
that i found my voice on this issue they
 
03:57:45.670 --> 03:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
have taken male human sperm
 
03:57:48.150 --> 03:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
exposed it to a laptop with the antennas
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
radiating it changed the dna which we
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
know as a road map to grow a proper
 
03:57:53.279 --> 03:57:54.389 align:start position:0%
know as a road map to grow a proper
anything

03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
it slowed the motility
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
and it caused far fewer sperm to be
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
viable or apoptosis which is programmed
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
cell death in four hours of radiation
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
exposure so that's how serious this is
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
evidence that children are more
 
03:58:10.720 --> 03:58:12.150 align:start position:0%
evidence that children are more
vulnerable

03:58:12.150 --> 03:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
one of our previous presenters mentioned
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
dr gandhi's work well dr gandhi has also
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
done studies that show that children are
 
03:58:23.510 --> 03:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
not just little adults biologically
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
their dna is still forming and we are
 
03:58:27.910 --> 03:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
damaging the dna
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
their skulls are thinner their brains
 
03:58:33.990 --> 03:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a higher water content
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we are allowing radiation to our
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
children as their central nervous system
 
03:58:41.910 --> 03:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
is developing as their immune system is
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
developing and the science shows this is
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
a neurotoxin and a genotoxin
 
03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
evidence for fetal and neonatal effects
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
the fetus is the most sensitive stage of

human development
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
i know a doctor who wore her lab coat

during her hospital rounds through both
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
of her pregnancies
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
both of her children now she carried

that phone right on top of the babies
 
03:59:08.830 --> 03:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
both of her children are now
 
03:59:08.840 --> 03:59:10.830 align:start position:0%
both of her children are now

what she sees in the children in her
 
03:59:25.830 --> 03:59:25.840 align:start position:0%

03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
about exposure to radio frequency

and it goes on and on the blood-brain
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
barrier we have membranes throughout our
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
bodies that protect sensitive areas from
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
toxins entering
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
the science shows from dr powell patcher
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
and others that this radio frequency
 
03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.950 align:start position:0%
and others that this radio frequency
bombardment

03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
bombardment
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
as dr chamberlain would say
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
jackhammering our systems night and day
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
is causing the blood brain barrier to
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
open it's opening the membranes that are
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to protect our brain
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
and now we have toxins going through the
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
bloodstream that can now take a turn
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
into the brain and so now we have a
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
whole host of neurological diseases that
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic we were at epidemic
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
levels of anxiety and depression we're
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
having suicidal ideation among children
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
like we have never seen and we are
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
leaving this radiation pulsating 24 7
 
04:00:34.150 --> 04:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
unless we know better because when we
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
know better we do better and that's why
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're here today we've already talked
 
04:00:41.429 --> 04:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
about cancers and so forth but there was
 
04:00:43.110 --> 04:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
a new paper that came out just this
 
04:00:43.120 --> 04:00:44.229 align:start position:0%
a new paper that came out just this
spring

04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
spring
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
on earlier and earlier onset alzheimer's
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
it used to take 25 years to show up
 
04:00:54.070 --> 04:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing alzheimer's and 20 year
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
olds 30 year olds
 
04:00:58.150 --> 04:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
and it's a neurotoxin
 
04:00:58.160 --> 04:00:59.349 align:start position:0%
and it's a neurotoxin
so

04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
dr martin paul is one of our world's
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
leading scientists on this and for a
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
long time the industry would say well
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism of harm identified
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
well you've already heard about a couple
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
of them here today with the oxidative
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
stress with the rouleaux effect when you
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
start changing the way
 
04:01:19.110 --> 04:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the blood moves through the
 
04:01:19.120 --> 04:01:20.550 align:start position:0%
that the blood moves through the
bloodstream

04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
bloodstream
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
red blood cells free floating
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
you put
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic fields on those they
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
start glomming together and forming a
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
chain called the rouleaux effect where
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
your blood can't get to where it needs
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
to go to oxygenate all your systems
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
chronic fatigue headaches nosebleeds
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
nausea dizziness anxiety
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
we know scientifically
 
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
why and how this is happening
 
04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
so that's all the good news we know and
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
now we can fix it right
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
rep cali pits to your question
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is what you do with your cell phone
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
you plug it in with an ethernet cable to
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
the back of your router
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
you buy a little adapter for 20 or 30
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and you plug your phone into it
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
anything that you do on the internet you
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
can safely do
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
through a cable you just go into your
 
04:02:17.910 --> 04:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
device and you turn off all of the
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
antennas the wi-fi the bluetooth the
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
locator the hotspot the cellular the
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
data and if anybody has already upgraded
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
to a 5g phone
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
those have separate antennas included
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
so just with our regular phones we had
 
04:02:34.640 --> 04:02:35.670 align:start position:0%
so just with our regular phones we had
six

04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
each one individually pulsing microwave
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
radiation to make or maintain a
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
handshake with the nearest cell tower or
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
router we don't need that
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be taught to use the
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
equipment in the safest way possible or
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
as the centers for disease control would
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
we want to get to alara as low as
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
reasonably achievable that's already in
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
place with the cdc for ionizing
 
04:03:00.720 --> 04:03:01.990 align:start position:0%
place with the cdc for ionizing
radiation

04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
04:03:04.389 --> 04:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
now that we have this it's time we get
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures in place to get
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
to as low as reasonably achievable
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
and for example
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
if you know you had your cell phone and
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
rhett partial had his
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
tablet or laptop there
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you need to plug in more than one
 
04:03:21.189 --> 04:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
all you need to do is buy a little
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
fifteen twenty dollar device called an
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
ethernet switch
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
then you can plug in as many devices as
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
you want and the kicker is you are going
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
to get such a faster speed your
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
reliability hands down will beat
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
anything wireless is ever going to
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
provide your data your security your
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
privacy is all so much better through an
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
ethernet cable so that's what we can do
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
for our own devices and then you turn it
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
off and you have perfectly safe
 
04:03:50.720 --> 04:03:52.790 align:start position:0%
off and you have perfectly safe
technology

04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the infrastructure level in our
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
communities the solution is fiber to the
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
premises we should not allow the
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
wireless industry to promote their
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
agenda to put a cell tower anywhere near
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
where we live work learn or play
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
we should be bringing the fiber optics
 
04:04:13.269 --> 04:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
right to the premises which we already
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
paid for time and again on our bills for
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
our cell phones but the industry did
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
some fancy shell game with the fight the
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
financing they took the hardwired
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
broadband money and they started putting
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
in their bucket for wireless so we have
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
excellent resources to teach our
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
communities how to do this
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
efficiently effectively and safely and
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
this reinventing wires the future of
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
landlines and networks is out of a
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
policy group in washington d.c
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
dr timothy sheckley was one of the
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
invited guests to the commission
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
and this tells us what we need to do so
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're not flying blind here we know the
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
solutions and at the national level with
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
the broadband funding that's coming
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
just this last month they said we are
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
giving preference to fiber to the
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
premises so the wheels are starting to
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
come off the bus for the wireless
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
industry and they know that
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
but we need to start protecting now
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
because it takes time for the science to
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
catch up to the federal public policy
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is why our country needs the state
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to do the right thing
 
04:05:20.319 --> 04:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to do the right thing
here

04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
with the time we have left i'll
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
entertain a couple more questions and
 
04:05:32.229 --> 04:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
then i'll ask if anybody would like to
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
say anything else that may still be
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
sitting down here before we uh adjourn
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i'll go to representative kelly pitts
 
04:05:38.720 --> 04:05:41.189 align:start position:0%
so i'll go to representative kelly pitts
next

04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
i understand what you said about the
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
i've heard it before but one of the
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
things this
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
i believe society is
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
addicted to and i'll say addicted is the
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
mobility we want everything here and we
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to be
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
into a plug
 
04:06:01.520 --> 04:06:02.229 align:start position:0%
into a plug
so

04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
that is one of the problems
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know i find it myself when i
 
04:06:09.670 --> 04:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
plug in my phone i can't reach it
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
i get really upset so i i
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
i it's not a neat it's not going to be
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
an easy solution
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
so you could do that while you're in
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
your house maybe if you had a long
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
enough cord like the phone call it used
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
to stretch 30 feet if you really tried
 
04:06:25.520 --> 04:06:26.790 align:start position:0%
to stretch 30 feet if you really tried
um

04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
but what do you do about
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
places like this where you're
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know you're surrounded well when
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're in a meeting we're not going to
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
get brain tumors unless that's an
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
explanation for what's wrong
 
04:06:40.800 --> 04:06:42.950 align:start position:0%
explanation for what's wrong
but

04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know again that's society yeah it's
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
education it just comes down to
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
education once we are able to tell the
 
04:06:49.600 --> 04:06:50.710 align:start position:0%
education once we are able to tell the
public

04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
what the biological risks are and what
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
the better solutions are it's going to
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
be like drugs and alcohol and gambling
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
and pornography adults will make their
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
choices but it is our responsibility
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
to protect our children above all else
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if you want a little encouragement
 
04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
the legal handbook for the massachusetts
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
boards of health when you asked about
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the municipal level
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
they've added four pages into theirs
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
about cell towers
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
so this is coming mainstream the
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
industry would prefer it not but when
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
rep abrami talked about that lawsuit
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
against the fcc
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
there was eleven thousand pages of
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence medical evidence and
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
over six thousand members of the public
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
who have been harmed or their loved ones
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
have been harmed
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
all in the public record on docket 1384
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the fcc
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the fcc closed
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
that docket and said we don't need to
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
change anything
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
once that hit the federal register the
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits began
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
and when the lawsuits began and the
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
judges at the federal level the d.c
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
circuit court ninth district court of
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
appeals they were presented with 27
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
volumes of 11 000 pages of evidence and
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
they looked at the fcc and said
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
please share with us what homework did
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
you do to prove
 
04:08:21.189 --> 04:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
that your fcc public radiation limits
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
that are set way high
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
what is your due diligence and they had
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
none they said oh the fda said it was
 
04:08:28.640 --> 04:08:29.750 align:start position:0%
none they said oh the fda said it was
fine

04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
well it was the fda who 20 years ago
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
commissioned this national toxicology
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
program that found clear evidence of
 
04:08:38.080 --> 04:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
program that found clear evidence of
cancerous

04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
cancerous
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
one might ask why
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
the fda would turn around to the fcc and
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
say keep doing business as usual
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
well when you look at the gentleman who
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
did that that was dr jeffrey shurin at
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
the fda and when you investigate a
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
little bit into his background you will
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
see that he is married to a woman who is
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
a partner in a law firm that represents
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry dr sharon has a
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
clear conflict of interest and when some
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
of our earlier testifiers
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
rattled off or gave to you in his packet
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
a list of organizations
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
that support the fcc we need to do our
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
due diligence on those and you don't
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
have to dig very far to find heavy
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest with the wireless
 
04:09:20.159 --> 04:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest with the wireless
industry

04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
so we can't take things at face value we
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
have to do the homework
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent plenty you still
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
i heard everything you said
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
and you you you're
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
pointing this all at 5g
 
04:09:38.159 --> 04:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
pointing this all at 5g
okay

04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
should we shut down television
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
no what happened with five with
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
television as dr chamberlain was saying
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
when we started television it was a
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
rolling continuous sine wave that was an
 
04:09:53.429 --> 04:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
analog signal when we got into digital
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
technology we added a square wave to
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
that and that's that spiked wave that's
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
going pulse pulse pulse
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
megahertz at a million times per second
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
gigahertz at a billion times a second
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
and we are not evolved to have that kind
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
of battering on our cells so it's
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
everything that's radio frequency
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
radiation and when the world health
 
04:10:15.439 --> 04:10:17.189 align:start position:0%
radiation and when the world health
organization

04:10:17.189 --> 04:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
classified this as a group 2b possible
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
human carcinogen in 2011
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
they were very clear to state this is
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
all man-made radio frequency it doesn't
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
matter what generation it is we need
 
04:10:30.319 --> 04:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
matter what generation it is we need
safety

04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial question
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thomas bob thank you for
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
addressing uh these issues particularly
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to hear a lot more about the
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
fcc and their involvement uh i am
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh the
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
level playing field that uh we're
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
getting and i'm not sure if that's
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
actually occurring one thing i didn't
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
hear today is too much is very much talk
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
about security concerns
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
i know that if i have a um
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
landline coming in my home that's fairly
 
04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:02.309 align:start position:0%
landline coming in my home that's fairly
secure

04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
secure
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
but 5g technology i've heard that it's
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
entity to come in
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
take the information they want
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
through a little bit of software close
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
it back up and you never know they're
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
well we as a commission didn't address
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
that particularly we knew that it is and
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
they know that it is an issue uh i know
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that but i don't feel
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
maybe like going into we should address
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
that here but yes you are very insecure
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
with wireless with wired your orders of
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the panel for
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
giving us their presentation today i'm
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
going to ask is there anyone sitting out
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
there now that would like to come up and
 
04:11:52.880 --> 04:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
there now that would like to come up and
speak

04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the next few i intend to end this by
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
2 30 so
 
04:11:57.760 --> 04:11:58.710 align:start position:0%
2 30 so
uh

04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
oh mr hancock would you like to come up
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
and say a few words
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
so in listening to the
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and this goes to what i was
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
talking about first of all that cable
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
right there
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the network cable
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's how an antenna is made so
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is extensive data and there was
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
advisory put out by the fda and cdc back
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
in 2011 advising people to
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh minimize the use of use of tethered
 
04:12:42.960 --> 04:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
uh minimize the use of use of tethered
ear

04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
ear
 
04:12:44.399 --> 04:12:45.349 align:start position:0%
ear
buds

04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
buds
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
with cell phones because it acted as a
 
04:12:48.000 --> 04:12:49.429 align:start position:0%
with cell phones because it acted as a
antenna

04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
antenna
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
and so as a result it actually magnified
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of radiation caused by the
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
cell phone and cell phone towers and
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
drove it directly into your head through
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
one of the openings in your head that
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
allows radiation to go in through your
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
ears and it was actually the wire that
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually caused that so as soon as you
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
plug a network cable
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
into your cell phone what you're
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
actually doing is creating a massively
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
long antenna of however long and what
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're actually doing is because it's so
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
long it will pick up low frequency
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
radiation significantly better so when
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking low frequency radiation
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
that could be wider than this room when
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
you have a 30 foot network cable you're
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
actually creating an excellent antenna
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
to go and receive those frequencies so
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
using a wire that's not fiber optic
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
to go and try and ameliorate the
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
radiation you're causing is actually
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
disingenuous and we know for a fact that
 
04:13:41.110 --> 04:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
the wire from your ear pad uh earpods
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
that uh apple saw fit to delete the port
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh so you can't do it anymore we know
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
for a fact that that was actually
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
causing more radiation and actually
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
exceeding fcc regulations on the
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
limitation of
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
radiation okay
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we know for a fact that that actually
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
is a really not good idea as for fiber
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
you asked the question about security uh
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
5g uses the same encryption as your web
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
browser does
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
every single website that you go to now
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
is encrypted uh using it in fact um
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
there was a study done by the pci
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
does the uh security and protection for
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
all uh online payments all all payment
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
terminals etcetera and they found that
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no benefit between a
 
04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
completely insecure wi-fi
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh access point with these terminals
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
using the encryption that these
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
terminals already use which your web
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
browser uses to go and view the websites
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
versus an encrypted wi-fi access point
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
because even if the data can be captured
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter because the data is
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
already encrypted so literally
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
everything you're doing is already
 
04:14:44.399 --> 04:14:45.429 align:start position:0%
everything you're doing is already
encrypted

04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
encrypted
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
the way that uh you're most at risk
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
from anything to do with your cell phone
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
is that your wireless carrier is
 
04:14:54.149 --> 04:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually uh intercepting every single
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
request you make um for websites you go
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
to so they can track every single
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
website you go to and they go and sell
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
that information in fact they've been
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
fined multiple times for doing so so
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
be more worried about the fact that
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're monitoring what you're surfing
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
not what you're actually entering while
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
you're surfing okay um because that's
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
where they're getting you you're you are
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
literally the product that they're
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
selling and they make a significant
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
portion of their
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh revenue that way but to talk
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
specifically about oxidative stress i
 
04:15:25.110 --> 04:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
brought up the most recent article there
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
are three on the nh nih gov website uh
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
the most recent one that i could find is
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
pathos physiology of cell phone
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
radiation oxidative stress and
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
carcinogenesis with focus on male
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive system
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
it gives you an abstract and some
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
definitions of their theoretical process
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
for which radiation might affect the
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive sperm counts and damage and
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
dna within sperm
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to scroll down to the abstract
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
on my cell phone ironically um
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
and uh what we'll see when i get down to
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
there i just got to find the right rate
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
so it says therefore the sar
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
limit maximum acceptable exposure limit
 
04:16:07.830 --> 04:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
should be lowered in cell phones however
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
more studies are necessary providing
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
definitive evidence against cell phone
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
radiation which can be provided in any
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
virtual studies combined with
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
computational bile monoling
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
and then it says it says uh stimulation
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
of plasma membrane n-d-a-a-d-h
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
oxidase might you don't need to know any
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the rest of the stuff might play a
 
04:16:29.110 --> 04:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
central role in the above-mentioned
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
effects i read this entire thing while
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony was just occurring
 
04:16:35.110 --> 04:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
literally the word might is the most
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
prevalent word in the entire document
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no conclusive actual
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
evidence in the document whatsoever that
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
shows that this process actually does
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
what they think it might do
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay and there is absolutely no claim
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that there's any causal
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
effect between this
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
and cancer
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of radiation
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
so again
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
we stereo faced with the fact that there
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
may be people that are sensitive to this
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of radiation there may be some
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of this of which we have no
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
evidence of causality and i can go
 
04:17:11.670 --> 04:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
through and i have i can forward to
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
whoever uh evidence of the other uh
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
assertion of
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh that was made as well that also
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
starts with an assumption that it that
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're correct
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then says based on that our
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that this might be
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
happening except they assume
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
that cancer is being caused by this
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
radiation of which there is no evidence
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
epidemiologically or otherwise in any
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
statistical form that has any
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
probability of
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
that is actually happening so they've
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
made an assumption that's false to go
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
and prove their claim from the beginning
 
04:17:43.199 --> 04:17:43.990 align:start position:0%
and prove their claim from the beginning
so

04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:44.000 --> 04:17:45.189 align:start position:0%
so
and

04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's very very very important to
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
hear what was said
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
by the members
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
that were just up here
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
what they were effectively saying
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
is this is the problem the cell phone
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
not the tower
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
this being in your pocket is a problem
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
this exposed to
 
04:18:05.520 --> 04:18:06.630 align:start position:0%
this exposed to
bare

04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
bare
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh semen is a problem which by the way
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
your cells are actually specialized and
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
your skin cells are specialized to
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
protect you against radiation of which
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
none of this radiation
 
04:18:21.510 --> 04:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh permeates your skin beyond a
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
millimeter so
 
04:18:25.110 --> 04:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way that any of these body
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
parts are going to be exposed in the way
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
that they're suggesting they would be
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
exposed to
 
04:18:29.600 --> 04:18:30.389 align:start position:0%
exposed to
so

04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
the issue is fundamentally first of all
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
they want this controlled
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
not the towers
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
because there's no way that you can turn
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
off the towers
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
and yes we can all do our part to turn
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
off cell phones and things like this
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
when we're not using them however every
 
04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
one of these devices goes into power
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
saving mode and it just sends a
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
heartbeat periodically and by
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
periodically i mean many many many
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
seconds if not minutes between
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
communications to the tower to say it's
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
still there when it goes into power
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
saving mode
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
so at night time this phone's generating
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
almost no radiation whatsoever because
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's in power saving mode okay it's
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
drastically reduced and even the cell
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
phone towers and memo is the thing that
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
allows this to happen if there are very
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
few cell phones on a tower as often
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
happens at night when they're not active
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the tower goes into what's called skip
 
04:19:18.000 --> 04:19:18.870 align:start position:0%
the tower goes into what's called skip
mode

04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
mode
 
04:19:20.790 --> 04:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it will actually start skipping
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
broadcasts to be able to save power
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
because it's in their interest to save
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
power so as a result they actually skip
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
and they skip all
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
a ton of broadcasts that they would
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise do so these towers are already
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
doing this our cell phones are already
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
every single study that's on the cdc's
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
website uses words might may could
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
this process might work this process may
 
04:19:47.590 --> 04:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
be what's causing it this problem
 
04:19:49.110 --> 04:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
process may or may not be causing
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
something this might be occurring
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
might what meanwhile starling is
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
broadcasting down in your head and
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
nobody in this room is going to be able
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
to stop it
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
we are running out of time time here i
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
want to ask the question uh to the
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
general audience uh
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
speakers or vendors or anyone that might
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
like to come back or come here for an
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
another meeting
 
04:20:19.520 --> 04:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
another meeting
um

04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
i see
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.680 --> 04:20:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
change your name please my name is galen
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
beach and i'm a licensed certified foot
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
reflexologist in the state of new
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire been practicing for
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
about 15 years and that's the science of
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
nerve reflex response in the body
 
04:20:52.080 --> 04:20:53.429 align:start position:0%
nerve reflex response in the body
and

04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
one of the comments that i just wanted
 
04:20:55.359 --> 04:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
one of the comments that i just wanted
to

04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:56.159 --> 04:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
to
make

04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
about um security
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
and such like is we're dealing with our
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
personal individual telephones
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
but what the proliferation of
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
cell towers and telephones and the
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
increases of power and energy and
 
04:21:14.399 --> 04:21:16.309 align:start position:0%
increases of power and energy and
frequencies

04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
frequencies
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
leads to is the capability for
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
cyber security
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
incursions on a large scale so i'm
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
thinking more of things that have
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
already happened
 
04:21:29.279 --> 04:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
already happened
since

04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
no different technology has been
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
introduced i'm thinking for example of
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the water treatment facility that was
 
04:21:41.840 --> 04:21:42.870 align:start position:0%
the water treatment facility that was
hacked

04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
hacked
 
04:21:42.880 --> 04:21:44.309 align:start position:0%
hacked
and

04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know the levels of some
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
substance were added to
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that would ostensibly make this water
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
poisonous this was done remotely
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
um anonymously
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
it was documented in a number of news
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
programs and
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
reports so it's not false
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
um these types of things attacks on
 
04:22:08.399 --> 04:22:09.990 align:start position:0%
um these types of things attacks on
infrastructure

04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:22:10.000 --> 04:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
and

04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
the embassy attacks supposedly
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know attacks may not have been it
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
might have just been stupidities just so
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
many people observing this and i've seen
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
people with like two or three
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
cell phones on them and they're all
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
iphones and those are all
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know pumping out in this room right
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
now like my heart rate is soaring i've
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
got a terrible headache i always feel
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
bad in here i'm just wondering does
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
everybody feel really good
 
04:22:36.159 --> 04:22:37.030 align:start position:0%
everybody feel really good
um

04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
since they've had their cell phones on
 
04:22:40.800 --> 04:22:42.389 align:start position:0%
since they've had their cell phones on
so

04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
that for
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
at least 20 to 30 years
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
the frequencies that
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
and technology devices
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
that are required and used in
 
04:22:56.399 --> 04:22:57.349 align:start position:0%
that are required and used in
five

04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:22:57.359 --> 04:22:58.389 align:start position:0%
five
5g

04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
5g
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
technology are considered and called
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
weapons grade
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is a concern
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
their weapons grade because of the
 
04:23:08.800 --> 04:23:10.309 align:start position:0%
their weapons grade because of the
capacity

04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
what is the weapon
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
sound basically in the capacity for
 
04:23:15.279 --> 04:23:17.349 align:start position:0%
sound basically in the capacity for
remote

04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
remote
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
operation of
 
04:23:18.960 --> 04:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
operation of
devices

04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
devices
 
04:23:20.560 --> 04:23:21.990 align:start position:0%
devices
is

04:23:21.990 --> 04:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
the weapon and do we really want
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
the capacity the capability of you know
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
more cell towers with more power being
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
remo controlled by god knows who and
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
will require
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know all new devices
 
04:23:40.000 --> 04:23:40.830 align:start position:0%
you know all new devices
more

04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:23:43.149 --> 04:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing you know so
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
environmentally with climate change
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
bad idea
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
security wise with
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know cyber security bad idea
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the body the the effects on the
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
human body
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
totally bad idea
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you know reflexology is a science
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
of nerve reflex response everything is
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
being electro
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
chemically neurotransmitted
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
by electric
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
and magnetic forces in your body so
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot saturate the body with more
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
they talk about hitting the skin
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
if these things are going through walls
 
04:24:22.149 --> 04:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
they're certainly going deeper than your
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
skin in reflexology we learn that
 
04:24:25.600 --> 04:24:26.469 align:start position:0%
skin in reflexology we learn that
the

04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:26.479 --> 04:24:28.309 align:start position:0%
the
body

04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't sense temperature except on the
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
outside so there's nerve endings on the
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the body that can detect heat
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
but when heat is going on within the
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
body with the heat buildup
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
the body is not sensing that
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
one of the problems one of the causes
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
for male infertility
 
04:24:46.880 --> 04:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
for male infertility
is

04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
that because of the eyeballs and the
 
04:24:52.640 --> 04:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
that because of the eyeballs and the
testes

04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
testes
 
04:24:54.000 --> 04:24:55.590 align:start position:0%
testes
the

04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
body cannot
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
circulate heat
 
04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
out of them fast enough
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
and this is why the the sperm is
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
basically cooking
 
04:25:06.070 --> 04:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
is why your eyeballs are basically
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
burning all the time
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's very poor circulation
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the eye structure and in the testes
 
04:25:13.680 --> 04:25:14.870 align:start position:0%
in the eye structure and in the testes
structure

04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
structure
 
04:25:14.880 --> 04:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
structure
so

04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
heat is retained in those tissues
 
04:25:18.640 --> 04:25:19.670 align:start position:0%
heat is retained in those tissues
and

04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know unless you can
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
run the heat off
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's sitting there
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
cooking your sperm basically
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
one of the other things is not just
 
04:25:31.520 --> 04:25:32.550 align:start position:0%
one of the other things is not just
cancer

04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's um also infertility it's kidney
 
04:25:35.520 --> 04:25:36.630 align:start position:0%
it's um also infertility it's kidney
disease

04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's diabetes
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
all of these things anyway so
 
04:25:41.199 --> 04:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
all of these things anyway so
um

04:25:43.110 --> 04:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
sorry that was incoherent but i get very
 
04:25:45.199 --> 04:25:46.790 align:start position:0%
sorry that was incoherent but i get very
discombobulated

04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
discombobulated
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
in um
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic frequencies that
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
are a little higher than they used to
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
and are nervous so anyways uh any
 
04:25:56.080 --> 04:25:59.189 align:start position:0%
and are nervous so anyways uh any
questions

04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.790 --> 04:26:00.800 align:start position:0%

much um i'm going to conclude this
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
meeting now with one question to our sub
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee members who i think
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.440 --> 04:26:41.450 align:start position:0%
my basic question is this do
 
04:26:41.450 --> 04:26:43.269 align:start position:0%
my basic question is this do
[Music]

04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
i i know i said that the next meeting
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
would be in the fall but uh some people
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
came to me during lunch and said if we
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
could have one sooner the only time that
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
i would have to have one sooner would be
 
04:26:58.229 --> 04:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
next week uh next tuesday um and so i'm
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to ask the subcommittee if if they
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
have an appetite for coming here next
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
week for
 
04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
one meeting we might uh we might even
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
discuss what we've heard and we might
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
even decide on something at the at that
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
meeting or there might be more people
 
04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
that want to come to
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
speak i'm not sure uh i understand there
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
might be some more people that would
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak i'm not sure but i think
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
the senator would like to speak and
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
the senator would like to speak we could
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
would you will you accept zoom testimony
 
04:27:33.279 --> 04:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
would you will you accept zoom testimony
no

04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
no they they can set a team up for us
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
what day would that be june
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
june 7th and i have a dinner
 
04:27:40.479 --> 04:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
june 7th and i have a dinner
plan

04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
consistently sent out on the 7th i don't
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
know why people have the eighth in their
 
04:27:54.000 --> 04:27:54.790 align:start position:0%
know why people have the eighth in their
mind

04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay well we could i i could ask to have
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
it on the eighth which would be a
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
wednesday if the subcommittee would like
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
to meet then if not i'm not available
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of the month after that so it's
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
either then or it would be sometime in
 
04:28:08.880 --> 04:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
either then or it would be sometime in
september

04:28:11.110 --> 04:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
september
 
04:28:11.120 --> 04:28:12.070 align:start position:0%
september
any

04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative partial can i make a
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion if i may be the chair and of
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh rep blood that's right here um we are
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
you are planning a lunch
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
for a retiring uh
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist could we mix a little business
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
with pleasure and attend both do you
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
believe it's down in manchester with the
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
110 grill that's closer to me than where
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm living here i'd be glad to meet in
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
the morning and adjourn
 
04:28:40.950 --> 04:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
oh you mean to like to meet here and
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
then go down to lunch
 
04:28:43.520 --> 04:28:45.349 align:start position:0%
then go down to lunch
oh

04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we could do that um certainly we
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
could we could start here at nine
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right and then um adjourned by
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%

11 15.
 
04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
what's the what's it's up to the
 
04:29:02.479 --> 04:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
what's the what's it's up to the
subcommittee

04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
all those
 
04:29:07.110 --> 04:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
is there there's a
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh straw vote show of hands of those
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
that would like to meet next tuesday
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%

04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
no preference mr chair
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
i prefer us
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
not to be up against a hard
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
stop time if it's only going to be an
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
hour and a half for me
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
we may take us
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we especially if we're going to make
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
a decision that that day
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
is the plan to make a decision that day
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
we could decide that day if we are if
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
we're in a position to make it this way
 
04:30:04.870 --> 04:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
there could possibly be another meeting
 
04:30:04.880 --> 04:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
there could possibly be another meeting
in

04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:30:05.600 --> 04:30:06.630 align:start position:0%
in
december

04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
december
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
i mean in september i could i i'm i i
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
can wait until september as well if if
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
you want to wait
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
some some don't want to wait
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
i mean did you want to wait did you want
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting for just a couple of
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
hours and then
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
come back in september that seems like a
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's the ninth no we're all i'm just
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
saying okay if it's
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
thursday we're going lost island
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a terrible week yeah i mean
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's fun it is it is a bad week and i'm
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'm leaving on the 11th so yeah
 
04:30:42.790 --> 04:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm all i'm saying is if
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
if we only do an hour it may not be
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be rushed at the end
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm getting at it can i
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
rather not i run out of habits
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
where we're rushed at the end
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would suggest monday however
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't give us enough time to put
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
it into the calendar it doesn't give us
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
a legal number of days
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
to advertise
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
you have enough time to get it in the
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
calendar yeah can i say there's a
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
calendar you have to have i think four
 
04:31:11.540 --> 04:31:11.550 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.550 --> 04:31:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:31:13.269 --> 04:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.469 --> 04:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
we all have had privy
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
to the commission's report
 
04:31:23.359 --> 04:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
to the commission's report
so

04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to say is probably
 
04:31:29.910 --> 04:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
not nice
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm i think we need not speeches
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
we need
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
information that we've already heard and
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard it before
 
04:31:39.600 --> 04:31:41.189 align:start position:0%
we've heard it before
and

04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
if these
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
people want to come back i think it
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
would be for questions
 
04:31:46.239 --> 04:31:47.349 align:start position:0%
would be for questions
and

04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
speeches i think
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
are what took up a lot of our time and
 
04:31:54.149 --> 04:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't need speeches we need
 
04:31:54.159 --> 04:31:56.550 align:start position:0%
we didn't need speeches we need
questions

04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:31:56.560 --> 04:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
questions
and

04:31:57.750 --> 04:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
that i mean i'm i've never held back on
 
04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
how i feel so that's how i feel that
 
04:32:05.429 --> 04:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of this time was
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
not wasted because it's all valuable
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
information but the commission
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
is we have heard
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
we all have privy to that report
 
04:32:16.399 --> 04:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
we all have privy to that report
so

04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
in my mind see you in september is a
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful song
 
04:32:21.920 --> 04:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
wonderful song
and

04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
i think we all have time to do our own
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
research more research and come back
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
with something definitive because i have
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
not heard one
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
definitive piece of information
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a report that says might
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
or may
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they've said no and
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they've said yes that
 
04:32:44.389 --> 04:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
means it's a nice way of saying i don't
 
04:32:44.399 --> 04:32:45.349 align:start position:0%
means it's a nice way of saying i don't
know

04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that we really need to chew
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
this over
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
some more and
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
again i haven't heard one piece of
 
04:32:54.960 --> 04:32:56.710 align:start position:0%
again i haven't heard one piece of
concrete

04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
information and i haven't read one piece
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
of concrete information and before we do
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
anything that would impede an industry
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
or a person an individual
 
04:33:15.189 --> 04:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:15.199 --> 04:33:16.551 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i have to agree that
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
for some of us it we may have heard some
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
information that was new although it was
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
in the report
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
but also uh
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
i did i didn't really hear i didn't hear
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the vendors
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i didn't hear
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
what they might be willing to do or what
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
they might willing to be
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
to be acceptable to them
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
in deference to people that are having
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
some issues
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
i heard
 
04:33:48.070 --> 04:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
black and white you know
 
04:33:51.189 --> 04:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes we do and no we don't
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard any
 
04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
real solutions
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
i don't even know at this point if there
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
is a legislative solution which is what
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this meeting is there
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
might be other private solutions out
 
04:34:03.119 --> 04:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
might be other private solutions out
there

04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate what's happening but
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
from a legislative point of view i
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't capture anything today
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
that could be turned into a potential
 
04:34:12.561 --> 04:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
that could be turned into a potential
bill

04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i think representative kelly pitts is
 
04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
right we probably do need to think about
 
04:34:17.680 --> 04:34:18.709 align:start position:0%
right we probably do need to think about
this

04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:18.719 --> 04:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
this
and

04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
unless there's strong objection
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
i guess i can say that we'll
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
see you in september
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's at a date and time to be
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
noticed personally
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be rushed next week i'd
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
rather see you in september
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay well i thank you for your time
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%

04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%

subcommittee
and

04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
if it's new if there's new information
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
or if you have some solutions or in
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
people who have vendors as clients
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
if vendors would like to reach out to us
 
04:35:01.990 --> 04:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about what
 
04:35:04.150 --> 04:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
could or could not be done or
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
voluntarily or otherwise
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
something that shows that
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
that they are listening to people that
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
have some issues and to find out
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
if there is anything that could have be
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
done and maybe there's not
 
04:35:19.349 --> 04:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
let's look let's hear we have a couple
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
