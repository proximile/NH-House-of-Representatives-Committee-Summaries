for so many especially those who are in
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
need like veterans first responders
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
those who are facing a diagnosis of
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
terminal illness
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
psilocybin therapy when
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
well administrated frustrated by a
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
licensed facilitator can help and that's
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
what we hope that you will um start to
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
consider and adopt
 
00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.829 align:start position:0%
consider and adopt
soon

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
one of the great and i think most
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
attractive things about psilocybin
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
therapy as the representative was saying
 
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.310 align:start position:0%
therapy as the representative was saying
our

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
is to really focus on the therapeutic
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
aspects of of this amendment
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
and not the decriminalization aspects
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm here to speak to the
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic components
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that societal therapy is designed for
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
just one or two sessions of use many of
 
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.350 align:start position:0%
just one or two sessions of use many of
us

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
have friends or family
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
who are on a daily regimen mental health
 
00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
who are on a daily regimen mental health
pills

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
pills
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
who are trying to treat
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
serious problems
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
with pills that may or may not actually
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
do the job
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's exciting about
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
psilocybin therapy is that it's designed
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
for intermittent use
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
one or two sessions
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of an entire year
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
can actually help people break through
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
those cycles of depression and start to
 
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.269 align:start position:0%
those cycles of depression and start to
find

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
health and wellness in a way that
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually improves their lives
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
i wanted to share with you a little bit
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
about the work that's going on in oregon
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
because i think it provides a road map
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
for the kind of regulated therapy that i
 
00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:54.710 align:start position:0%
for the kind of regulated therapy that i
that

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
that i recommend to this body
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
um the measurement that passed in oregon
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
specifically designs
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
a container of regulated access
 
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
a container of regulated access
that

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
requires a series of licenses
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
and rules in order to actually have a
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
have a patient actually access the
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
therapy there are um the healing centers
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
where people will go and receive the
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
therapy are licensed the therapists and
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
facilitators who actually provide the
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
therapy are licensed
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
the individuals who will grow the
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
psilocybin are licensed and the testing
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
centers that are actually going to
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate the still assignment to make
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
sure that it's safe is also licensed all
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
of that regulation is designed to help
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
maximize and promote safety
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
the model here is
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
does not envision or ever encourage
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
individual at-home use these are
 
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.030 align:start position:0%
individual at-home use these are
supervised

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
supervised
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
sections where an individual goes into a
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
center sits with this therapist for
 
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%
center sits with this therapist for
hours

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
gets treatment
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
the therapy the drug wears off and then
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to go home
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
this isn't
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
this isn't a go pick up your drug at the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and go home type of operation
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
that the the actual
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
the treatment is the therapy it's not
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
just the drug it's a combination it's
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
different than many other drugs in that
 
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.670 align:start position:0%
different than many other drugs in that
way

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.509 align:start position:0%
way
um

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of the other things that are
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
important about our approach to this
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
drug and we'd be glad to answer any
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions that the community may have is
 
00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.069 align:start position:0%
questions that the community may have is
that

00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
there is no retail use there's no sales
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's no advertising this is this
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
isn't designed to be
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
as many people may
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
be thinking a cannabis 2.0
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
they're much different drugs and
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
designed for much different populations
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
the number of people who use psilocybin
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
is so small in comparison to the number
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
of people who might partake in a
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
legalized cannabis model
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
but the treatment here
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's not about recreation it's about
 
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.110 align:start position:0%
it's not about recreation it's about
healing

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
healing
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
and as i as i wrap up my comments to you
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
all today i just want to share a couple
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
more things about
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
about where i hope that this therapy and
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
treatment may go
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
many of the groups that we work with
 
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.550 align:start position:0%
many of the groups that we work with
are

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
organizations that deal with people who
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
are in deep depression or facing deep
 
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.590 align:start position:0%
are in deep depression or facing deep
trauma

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
we work with veterans organizations who
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
currently right now
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
raise money
 
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.509 align:start position:0%
raise money
to

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
send veterans to foreign countries
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
to actually get the treatment that they
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
need to treat their ptsd
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
we work with palliative care doctors
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
who talk about all of the drugs that
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
they have to treat people's
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
physical pain
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of their life
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
but the frustrations that these doctors
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
have that they have no tools
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
no drugs
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
attention on this important issue and
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
i've never recognized myself for a
 
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
i've never recognized myself for a
question

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
what is the fda position currently
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
regarding physicians prescribing this
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
for treatment
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative roy members of the
 
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
representative roy members of the
committee

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
the currently psilocybin is in phase two
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
of its clinical trials with the fda and
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
so the fda has not approved psilocybin
 
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:05.909 align:start position:0%
so the fda has not approved psilocybin
for

00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
prescription use
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
prescription use
it

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
i i think most who are involved in the
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
fda clinical trials process expect that
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
for some
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
diagnoses probably treatment treatment
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
resistant depression is probably them
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
can find them
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
i do think that therapeutic uses
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
could serve an unmet need and i think
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that if they come together
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
it will still benefit the health and
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to speak on this
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill who wasn't signed up
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
there being no one i'm going to go ahead
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and close the public hearing on hpp 1349
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna go ahead and reset this
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%

so

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.159 --> 00:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.520 --> 00:23:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.960 --> 00:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
language

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
at this time we will
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing
 
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:02.390 align:start position:0%
reopen the public hearing
and

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%

uh we will begin on hb 1598
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative abbess

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and warning
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee can everybody
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
i'm representative daryl abbas and i
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent rockhampton district 8.
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
now whether you support hp 1598 or not
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think that we all agree that the
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
really needs to address this issue
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's been about 13 years since the
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
federal government's
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically stopped enforcing the majority
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the cannabis laws
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
a short history lesson back on december
 
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%
a short history lesson back on december
5th

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
5th
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
1933 the 21st amendment was passed
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
and what that did is that repealed the
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
18th amendment
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
which effectively ended the prohibition
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
on alcohol
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
and when that happened the alcohol
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
industry was upside down
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons for that is that
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
there were bootleggers running around
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere that was mostly organized
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
run by organized crime
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
in other criminal enterprises
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
to combat that problem
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire began selling liquor
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
without overburdening consumers
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
with over taxation
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
this allowed consumers all over new
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
england to come to new hampshire
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
and purchase a superior clean product
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
that was tax-free that exceeded the
 
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.310 align:start position:0%
that was tax-free that exceeded the
quality

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
of what you could purchase from a
 
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.590 align:start position:0%
of what you could purchase from a
bootlegger

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
bootlegger
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
while remaining while maintaining a
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
competitive price
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
we've watched one state after another
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
roll out recreational cannabis policies
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
over-regulation over taxation
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
fueled the demand in the black market
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
rather than support a policy over
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
rather than support a policy over
taxation

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
like our retail liquor sales i'm
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
promoting the idea of the new hampshire
 
00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
promoting the idea of the new hampshire
selling

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
cannabis tax-free
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
now just to clarify if
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
this does not mean that the canvas would
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
be sold out a state liquor store
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
the understanding is that it would be in
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
the separate
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
retail store altogether
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already has this
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
with our liquor commission
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have the model and it's been proven
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be a successful operation
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
in respect to new hampshire state liquor
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
in respect to new hampshire state liquor
sales

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the net revenue
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
from the sale of alcohol in the state of
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
was approximately 175 million dollars
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
the gross sales
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the gross revenue was approximately 750
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
people come from all over new england
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they purchase
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
liquor from new hampshire because let's
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's been reported that approximately 40
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
to 50 of the sales of alcohol in this
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
data to out-of-state consumers
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
so i look at the recreational candidate
 
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:32.789 align:start position:0%
so i look at the recreational candidate
cannabis

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity for history to repeat
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity for history to repeat
itself

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
and allows the state to maximize its
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
revenue before i get into the benefits
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
of that policy i want to just clarify
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
a few other issues
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
cultivation manufacturing
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
and testing and any type of
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
transportation would still remain
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
now we've this committee has been we've
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
every year i understand
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
before i became a
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative there's been several
 
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.070 align:start position:0%
representative there's been several
bills

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
promoting recreational candidates
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
and again as for the benefits
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
look no further than the bill we
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
recently had was hb 237
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
the highest projected gross revenues was
 
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.470 align:start position:0%
the highest projected gross revenues was
around

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
36 million dollars
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
that is taking into consideration a five
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
percent transfer tax and nine percent
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
which i would just put that out there
 
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.710 align:start position:0%
which i would just put that out there
completely

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
if the state operates the retailer the
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
markup on the flower alone
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
depending on on the cultivator is around
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you land right in the middle that is
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
seven times the revenue
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
that the state would earn
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
if they sold it at a lower price
 
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
if they sold it at a lower price
however

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
if you just matched it that way it's
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
seven times the amount that that would
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
put the gross revenue over 250 million
 
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.389 align:start position:0%
put the gross revenue over 250 million
dollars

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that's not taken into consideration
 
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.470 align:start position:0%
and that's not taken into consideration
the

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
potential for increasing the
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
out-of-state consumers
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
like we do with liquor it's also not
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration there's a
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
higher markup
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
on some
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
so the number of 250 million
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
i would i would present is a very
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
conservative figure
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
for the communities that are concerned
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
about cannabis the advantage of having a
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
state-run retailer
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that you're not you're unlikely to
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
have six seven retail stores in one
 
00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
have six seven retail stores in one
community

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
community where i come from where i live
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
sam there's one liquor store
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
procedurally there would be one
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh canvas retail store
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of constituents and
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
people i've talked to throughout the
 
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
people i've talked to throughout the
state

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
who don't necessarily support
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand understand the atmosphere of
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
the state and they understand that
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
the polls show that about 80 percent of
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire residents support the
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
recreational policy but many people
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
support also not having 10 retail stores
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
residents in this state they're either
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing cannabis in the black market
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
or they're driving out of state
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
and purchasing cannabis
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
so that revenue is being lost to the
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
black market to other states
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
however we're still
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the extenders and people who believe
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
that there's social problems that are
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
related to camp recreational campus
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with those problems
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
but not getting any revenue to actually
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
address those problems
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's why when it comes to the net
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
revenue the way that this bill is
 
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.389 align:start position:0%
revenue the way that this bill is
drafted

00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
any money that was drawn originally from
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
the general fund to actually
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
start this program would be repaid but
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
after that the next 25 million in net
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
revenue would go directly
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
to dhhs
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
to deal specifically with
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
drug treatment substance abuse programs
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
and issues relating to mental health
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's related to substance abuse
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
after that and
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
after that 25 million has been paid to
 
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.389 align:start position:0%
after that 25 million has been paid to
dhhs

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
90 of the net revenue would actually be
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
applied to offset the statewide
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and what that would do
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
one of the other concerns i hear from
 
00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:48.549 align:start position:0%
one of the other concerns i hear from
from

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
constituents all over the state
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
is high property taxes
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
this is a reality when we have a policy
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we can implement we can make a
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
significant reduction
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
for property taxes throughout the entire
 
00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:08.310 align:start position:0%
for property taxes throughout the entire
state

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
without compromising
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
funding for public education
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
it also puts us in a position in the
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
future to potentially increase funding
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
for public education without raising
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's a reality it's right in front of us
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
and we can do it
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
and hb5 1598
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
puts it on paper
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
and it's been i believe this is a policy
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
just some other concerns that i've heard
 
00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.270 align:start position:0%
just some other concerns that i've heard
and

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
there is going to be uh i've been
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
for some of the penalties for violations
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the possession limits
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh the bill as stated now hasn't listed
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
as a misdemeanors if you're using
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis in public or if you're
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
in a motor vehicle where some you're the
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
driver or another
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
passenger passengers using cannabis
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's listed now as a misdemeanor the
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
amendment would reduce those to a
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
violation for the first offense
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you're using canvas in a public
 
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh if you're using canvas in a public
place

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
even though it's a violation any
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
candidate in your possession is subject
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
to forfeiture
 
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.069 align:start position:0%
to forfeiture
again

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns people raised was the
 
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.109 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns people raised was the
public

00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis in a public place
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
i hope that that this would mitigate
 
00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.310 align:start position:0%
i hope that that this would mitigate
that

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it would hopefully
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
not be a situation where you go to the
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampton beach you go
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
walking on trails into people smoking
 
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.349 align:start position:0%
walking on trails into people smoking
everywhere

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
the other issue is if you're offering a
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that there is no field
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
sobriety test that's a legitimate
 
00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.430 align:start position:0%
sobriety test that's a legitimate
concern

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it doesn't take into
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
consideration whether the driver is
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
impaired the driver is responsible for
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
what happens in their vehicle if a
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
passenger begins he's not their response
 
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.230 align:start position:0%
passenger begins he's not their response
from

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
ensuring that passengers are also not
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
using cannabis but that would be reduced
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
to a violation as well
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill had it at a
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
six-month loss license it would be
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
reduced for three-month
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
loss license that and this that
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
provision was also in hpv 237
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
reduced the loss of the license to three
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.589 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right okay
 
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.950 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right okay
i'm

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
concerned

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
in looking at the bill
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the effect on young people you talk
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.390 align:start position:0%
of the effect on young people you talk
about

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
the various allowances that can be used
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
or not used by
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
a younger person but what i'm concerned
 
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.870 align:start position:0%
a younger person but what i'm concerned
about

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.910 align:start position:0%
about
is

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
we now make it legal
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
for an adult
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh to
possess

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
possess
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
what we're not doing or this doesn't
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
appear to me in in the bill
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
coming up with a sufficient penalty
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
for him
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
or her
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
if they were distributed
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
to a younger person i mean i've looked
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
at the cdc report
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
the effects on younger people
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
for school and suicide
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
and things like that are devastating
 
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.510 align:start position:0%
and things like that are devastating
so

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
where is the penalty
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
to prevent me if i
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
were to purchase cannabis
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
from giving it to an underage
 
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.750 align:start position:0%
from giving it to an underage
child

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
causing permanent damage to him uh you
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's an
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
excellent point
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i would love to work with you on an
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to include a penalty
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
i said a penalty that you find
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
satisfactory because
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
the age limit is going to be 21.
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
so anyone that's distributing marijuana
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
to a minor that's not prohibited are
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to possess it that is a crime
 
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
allowed to possess it that is a crime
but

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's something i would be more than
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
willing to work with you on i agree
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
that and one of the ideas behind having
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state-run retail store
 
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.990 align:start position:0%
the state-run retail store
is

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
when i've seen this with liquor
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
being raised in living
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
during my life here in new hampshire is
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
that they're very good at preventing
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
miners from purchasing from the store
 
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.510 align:start position:0%
miners from purchasing from the store
directly

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons that i i
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
favor this policy so i share that
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
coming up with some sort of penalty to
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
giving it to an underage
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh isn't cannabis still a federal
 
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.230 align:start position:0%
uh isn't cannabis still a federal
offense

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it what i mentioned when i might
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
when i was in the introduction
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
was that for about 13 years now there's
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
been a directive to not even enforce
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
their own laws
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're basically ignoring them so any
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
preemption argument that has been made
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court i would
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
suggest it still
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is that the federal
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
government has voluntarily
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
given up their control they haven't
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
repealed the law but they're not
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing it and that's the problem that
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
that by doing that that that handcuffs
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity in the camp whether
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's the medical side or the
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
recreational side but they're simply not
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing it so it is against federal
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
law but so is
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh medical use of cannabis
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we have medical cannabis facilities
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
we give them licenses
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
and just to put in perspective if you go
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
on a computer or a phone and you have a
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
fidelity account you can go buy shares
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the new york stock exchange cannabis
 
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.630 align:start position:0%
on the new york stock exchange cannabis
company

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
and no one gets arrested for
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
now i'm not saying that that's legal but
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
so this bill i understand is maybe
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
contradictory to federal law as is every
 
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
contradictory to federal law as is every
other

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
medical or recreational cannabis policy
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
or bill
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's law now a law enough state
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
where it's a drug
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
and drugs or
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
issues through
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacies shouldn't this be uh issued
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
well i think you're referring to the
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
medical use of cannabis this is purely
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
for recreational use
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
i understand the argument if it's for
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
medical use why is it not through
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals well the problem with
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
that if they've ever went that direction
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
is that it's again
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's way outdated the non-enforcing
 
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
that's way outdated the non-enforcing
thing

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's illegal in the federal law so it's
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies i'm not i know
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
there's some states that are trying to
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
cast laws to make insurance cover the
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
costs of medical cannabis
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's its own issue here but without
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
the federal with the federal prohibition
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's another example of maybe they
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
should take some action
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to write a joint letter to
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'll prepare that with you
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
question so i'm
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm was following along with you
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i did read the legislation prior and
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
i think the part that i'm
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think i want to just make clear so i
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
get it is that this would be
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
let me let me put i have two questions
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
so my first
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
this would be run
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
through the liquor commission and then
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
morph into its own commission
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that how i'm reading this i'm
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
i think i'm on page
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
oh these are not numbered
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
but the lecture commission indicates
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
this would sign candle sale and license
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
your responsibilities to the liquor
 
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
your responsibilities to the liquor
commission

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
including the responsibility to set up
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
the retail store operation
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then did i understand from your
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that then it would become
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
i can clarify
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
when i meant its own operation is that
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
if you walk if you go to a new hampshire
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
liquor store yes canada is not going to
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
be sold out of a new hampshire liquor
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
store however the regulation and
 
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
store however the regulation and
enforcement

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
and some of the
 
00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:36.470 align:start position:0%
and some of the
regulations

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
that apply to cultivators even the
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
retail advertising packaging there is
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to be some
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
that will be uh
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
oversaw by the liquor commission
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the rationale for that is
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
in respect to the bill we had hb 237 it
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
was basically cloning the liquor
 
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
was basically cloning the liquor
commission

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
so we were basically making the same
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
operation doing the same thing
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
i looked at it as well if
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
you potentially could have run through
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
the same organization it would actually
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
not be a lot of duplicate
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
so that was the rationale for doing that
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
and there is some
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
the only issue with now is that there's
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
a rule making process for some local
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
regulations unless this bill would need
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
to pass and become law in order for some
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the more finer details of final
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
regulations to be made
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
there is a time frame and structure for
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
those rules to be made within a certain
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is that it would be
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that cannabis
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
sales would be a state-run operation and
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
from what i heard in your testimony that
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
there would not be
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay and and so
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
in looking
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
in part of the argument of like we are
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
we are an island surrounded by all these
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
other states that already
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis so we lose revenue that is
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
border jumping so in maine maine took in
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
fifty million six hundred and eighty
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
five thousand eight hundred and fifty
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.109 align:start position:0%
dollars in
taxes

00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't look like in
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts took in 81 million in
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
vermont took in 27 million
 
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
vermont took in 27 million
um

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
just from where i live um 20 minutes
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
away 25 minutes away from where i live
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the city of kittery
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
is opening three dispensaries
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
and they had application fees for
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
representatives is there a question
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
there is a question thank you
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair um application fees alone were
 
00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:01.829 align:start position:0%
mr chair um application fees alone were
535

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
535
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
000 so it seems like would we be leaving
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in application fees
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars of
 
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.190 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars of
taxes

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
that could benefit
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
the state
by

00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
making it another
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
state funded operation where the
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds are pulled out i mean the
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
operation cost it looks like come out of
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
the general fund i i can answer that and
 
00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
the general fund i i can answer that and
thanks

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes less is more and with our
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
liquor when you go to a new hampshire
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
liquor store there's not a state
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
sales tax on
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
a bottle of liquor
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue the state makes is from the
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
revenue from the sale
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
so that's where the state we would not
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
have to have a sales tax or put a
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
transfer tax on the cultivators and the
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturer would we would not need to
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
do that because the revenue is from
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
the sale itself
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
and the difference between
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis and liquor is that the markup
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
on canvas is a lot higher than liquor so
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more revenue to be made
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
in respect to the application fees i see
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the states
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
have these very very high application
 
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.829 align:start position:0%
have these very very high application
fees

00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
one example one state they had an equity
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
application trying to particularly
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
provide applications or licenses for
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
my people of minorities so they can get
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
into the industry
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
the application is still a million
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
dollar process
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that has equitable
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
affair to anyone and that's certainly
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
not shouldn't be the new hampshire way
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
the only person of wealth is able to buy
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
into an industry i understand you would
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
have to have it's still a startup it's
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
still going to cost money to actually
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
open a business
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
but some of those application fees
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
really prevent people from having the
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get into the industry
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
because we're making
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
seven times the revenue just compared to
 
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
seven times the revenue just compared to
what

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
what the market isn't just this just
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
talking just uh the flower product the
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
market on the
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing products is much higher
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
so that's where the revenues need made
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that also means that we can sell at
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
a much lower price point like our liquor
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
so that would drive up out of state
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
consumers to come here right now people
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
come here you see that you see it all
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
the time on the highway people are
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
loading up their car with boxes and
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
boxes of liquor
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
and there's certain times if you buy 12
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
balls of wine at a time you get a 15
 
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
balls of wine at a time you get a 15
discount

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
discount
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it's being done already and it's
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
proven to be a very successful model and
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's where the revenue would come from
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
and if you look at hb 237 the
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated revenue from out of state
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
consumers was very low
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
and the black market sales was close to
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually matching
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
the legal recreational sales
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
by being able to actually sell a product
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
at a competitive price with the black
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
at a competitive price with the black
market

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm just using logic here i don't
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
believe would make sense to buy
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
canvas in the black market if you can
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
buy a clean
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
product that's likely going to be
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
superior that has packaging labeling
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's been regulated for a comparable
 
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.910 align:start position:0%
it's been regulated for a comparable
price

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is the problem that i've had with
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
prior cannabis bills
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
is that if you over tax it and over
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
regulate it it drives up the retail
 
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.710 align:start position:0%
regulate it it drives up the retail
price

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and you can go buy it for a fraction of
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
the price
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the black market and this this puts
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
in a position where
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're selling a better product
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
for a similar price that's a basic
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
market principle no reason why we
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it already a felony to give
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana to a minor
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then what are the penalties
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
for alcohol
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
from somebody that's 22 years old giving
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
my blue books in the brief my briefcase
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
is over there
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's already against the law i'm not
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure if it's if it rises to a felony
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
i do not know this but from what i hear
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
those small shops that we have
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
especially on the border
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's one down in massachusetts not
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
that far from the one
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
on the border in new hampshire
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the one in new hampshire is just
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
full of massachusetts cars
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know and you live in salem so i was
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you drove by one of those
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify you're asking if i drove
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
i've lived in salem the overwhelming
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
majority of my life
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
and if you look at first of all there's
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
a giant liquid store there there's tons
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts license plates in that
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
parking lot if you go to this
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
right where you get to where you know
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
the 213
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
exit 213 is which is right over the
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
third border
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there is so many vape
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
stores that are all over the place
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
and there's tons of massachusetts plates
 
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
and there's tons of massachusetts plates
there

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns i have with uh
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
is that if all if you had a recreational
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
candidate as policy as would you would
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
it be like we have with
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
vaping would they be 10
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
retail stores and sale
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i always had concerns about i
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
understand the town can pass zoning and
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
the communities can do that i always i
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
have that concern
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i really
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's something i wouldn't support is
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
having that many retail stores so when
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
the state does it it's it's still
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
keeping a hand on the wheel
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i've heard some criticism by having
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
the state run it and oh it's a monopoly
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
but and if you have private retailers
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
they generally limit the licenses anyway
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is also a monopoly
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
so except for under our state
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
constitution having a private monopoly
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional
 
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:39.990 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional
so

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.549 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
i would just like to clarify your
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
response to previous testimony that
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
compared the model with taxes
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the model with markup
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like
 
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like
when

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
you said we could make the same amount
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
your model would allow for us also to
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
gain revenue
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
but isn't the markup also baked into the
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
state sales
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
of other states that
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
also have taxes or
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
will we actually be able to do that if
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
they also have a big markup for that for
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
their sales
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to taxes
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
if i think i understood it correctly
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're worried about the markup
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
and how we can deal with other states in
 
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.230 align:start position:0%
and how we can deal with other states in
massachusetts

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
first of all if it's not for medical use
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's a 20 sales tax
 
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.390 align:start position:0%
it's a 20 sales tax
and

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
from what i from my research is if you
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
were to purchase one ounce of flour
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis in this you know leaf or
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
wheat in its leaf sub form
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about 300 an ounce
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
plus a 20 sales tax
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
and some products are even higher than
 
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
and some products are even higher than
that

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is in
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
with in new hampshire
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
we could sell it for a lower price than
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
that because the revenue
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be from the sale itself and
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you purchase in bulk again it depends
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
on the cost rate depends on the
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
particular strain that's why it's the
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
markups between 80 and 120 that is that
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
information was provided to me by uh
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
individuals individuals in the industry
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
of cultivation
 
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.109 align:start position:0%
of cultivation
so

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
the markup can be much higher but if you
 
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
if the price is too high
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
350 dollars first of all that's not
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
really consumer friendly nobody can
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
afford that
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
and that's why some people go to the
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
black market
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
if you you could legitimately sell that
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a hundred dollars less and still
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
make a significant
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
profit off the revenue and at the same
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
time that would encourage consumers to
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire to purchase
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis right now people are driving
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
from new york
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire to maine to
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis and they go to store
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
by store by store buying
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount they can then they
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
head back to connecticut they head back
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
to wherever wherever they're from
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's happening quite frequently
 
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
it's happening quite frequently
so

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that they'll stop in new
 
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.309 align:start position:0%
i believe that they'll stop in new
hampshire

00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead representative pratt
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
hello representative
 
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.630 align:start position:0%
hello representative
uh

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
it appears that we're trying to model
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
after the alcohol business in new
 
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.190 align:start position:0%
after the alcohol business in new
hampshire

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
do you know the cost of alcohol in new
 
00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:00.309 align:start position:0%
do you know the cost of alcohol in new
hampshire

00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
to society
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
are you talking society or for the the
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
liquor commission like the amount of
 
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.309 align:start position:0%
liquor commission like the amount of
deaths

00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the amount of the cost of the
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol business in new hampshire
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
what i but and i listen i have i have
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
young children
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
and i live in the state i drive in the
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
state i share the same concerns of
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
everyone else
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know there is there is a public
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
safety issue that goes along with this
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
my family rented a place in salisbury i
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
wish they rented one in new hampshire
 
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.549 align:start position:0%
wish they rented one in new hampshire
but

00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
i had no say in that
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
and they have a
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
retail store there
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i i parked and i i sat and watched
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
for about half hour
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would say more than half of the cars
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
that pulled in had new hampshire license
 
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
that pulled in had new hampshire license
plates

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
plates
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the public safety concerns
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
that exist related to recreational
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis i understand
 
00:56:59.200 --> 00:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
cannabis i understand
but

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i although this could
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of cannabis use it's
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine people from new
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire going there i talked to people
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
who've driven that's what they do
 
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.670 align:start position:0%
who've driven that's what they do
so

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of the public policy concerns are
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
still going to be there however we don't
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
have any of the
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
revenue to support
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
addressing those concerns that's why the
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
way this is drafted the first
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
25 million in in net revenue every year
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
is the goal
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
towards drug treatment drug prevention
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
and not just for cannabis for the
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
for opioids the state we're the only
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
state in the entire country where drug
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
overdoses has dropped
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the last two years but even though
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's that even that's great but we can
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
do better this puts us in a position to
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually do better
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
and prevent overdoses as well
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
and actually treat people who are using
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
drugs or abusing drugs and help them get
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
better not just dealing with the
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
substance abuse the mental health side
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
of it often triggers a drug losses
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
so this is putting the state in the
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
position to fight that problem better
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
i understand it may sound hypocritical
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
to say you're using revenue from
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
candidates to do that but
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to i believe people get the
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
job done and if i sound like a hypocrite
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'll accept that but
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to leave my answer on your
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
question uh my question answered about
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
341 people die from alcoholic so new
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire is making a profit of alcohol
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
about 341 people in new hampshire that
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
died on an average representative pratt
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that's not a
 
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.630 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that's not a
question

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
i won't talk anymore thank you very much
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it any suggestion we should
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
make alcohol illegal
 
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.750 align:start position:0%
make alcohol illegal
well

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
not 340 people well we don't want to get
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
a discussion like that but uh 741 people
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
we reminded to the community we're not
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
um we can
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative abbas is a member of
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
the community anticipate we will have
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
work sessions and executive sessions an
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
ample opportunity to question and debate
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
let's uh let this witness go that way so
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
we can get other members thank you for
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
your time
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is what the
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative from raymond understands
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
if a community has already prohibited
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
through zoning or local ordinance to not
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
permit a retail cannabis store from
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
opening which i understand the agreement
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire did that that would be
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
that would be honored if this bill were
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
my question is what
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
percentage and how long would it take
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
before we see a difference in property
 
01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
before we see a difference in property
tax

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's assuming that this became one today
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
it would likely take about two years to
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
become fully operational because
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the cultivation industry is
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
still going to be
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
private industry there's going to be a
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
licensing process for that and then it
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
will be a certain time where you could
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
then turn a profit on that so
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
i would say that in the following year
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
it would be a three-year window
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
if i could do it faster i would but this
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
is a complicated process but at the same
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
time i'd rather deliver it in three
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
years and not deliver it at all
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and thank
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
could i ask on the methodology on the
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
uh

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
section of this bill
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a statement that said the bill
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
appropriates the sum of five million for
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
the biennium ending
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.710 align:start position:0%
the biennium ending
23.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh okay and then that goes on it says
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
the commission believes the five million
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
is not adequate to accomplish this
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the expectations set out
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the bill do you agree with that could
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
you explain that
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
you explain that
so

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
when that was this was prepared i
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand that is not going to be a
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of allocation
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
to actually get
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
this operational
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
what what i understand is that there's
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
an amendment in the process here that
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
addresses the allocation issue
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
but i do agree i didn't factor in the
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
building out the stores
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that's information i didn't have
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
available to me at the time so it
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't for me to then just make a
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
higher number i would have been just
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
guessing i thought that would be
 
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.029 align:start position:0%
guessing i thought that would be
irresponsible

01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission is accurate i
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any reason to challenge or
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
just one more question uh
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
started the alcohol business
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
they promised 10 of the profits to go
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
into alcoholism
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
because they knew that the increase of
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol to the community would have a
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem with alcoholism so there was a
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
ten percent off the profits that were
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to be put aside for that is
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
there something like that in this bill
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
for addiction
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
just when
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol and that happened it was in the
 
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.670 align:start position:0%
alcohol and that happened it was in the
1930s

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
1930s
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
i i wasn't born yet
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to explain in this
 
01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to explain in this
bill

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
after any money that's drawn from the
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
to get this program started it will be
 
01:03:09.359 --> 01:03:10.470 align:start position:0%
to get this program started it will be
repaid

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
repaid
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
to the general fund once that one-time
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
allocation allocations repaid
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
every year the first 25 million dollars
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
in net revenue
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
would go directly towards
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
there are no further questions or
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
witnesses excuse thank you for your
 
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.150 align:start position:0%
witnesses excuse thank you for your
testimony

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls chief bryanski
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and members of the
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is john bryfonsky i am
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
the chief of police in bedford new
 
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
the chief of police in bedford new
hampshire

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
going on 11 years now 43 years
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
experience 27 of those as you may recall
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
from some previous testimony
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
with the federal government u.s drug
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement administration so i have
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of experience in dealing
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
with substance abuse
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement particularly with
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
respect to this bill
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
you have my written testimony it's quite
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
expensive i'm not going to repeat it but
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
i do want to cover
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
a number of important points that i
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
believe were brought up
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
by the chair and the sponsor of the bill
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
that public safety
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
needs to address and would like to share
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
with you members of the committee
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
so from a public pers
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
safety perspective i think the important
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
thing to think about
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
as i present the testimony is i
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
represent the embodiment of the
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
police officers the deputies and the
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
police officers the deputies and the
troopers

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
troopers
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
that deal with
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
the aftermath
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
of substance abuse as it relates to
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis use
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
yes there are states that surround us
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
that have legalized and commercialized
 
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.190 align:start position:0%
that have legalized and commercialized
cannabis

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
but as you can see the studies show in
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
each of those states that
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis use by our youth
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
in those states goes up
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
when it's legalized uh is it prevalent
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
now yes
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
but this bill will most assuredly
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
increase cannabis use
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
by our most vulnerable segment of the
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
population which is our youth
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
the public health elements and studies
 
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
the public health elements and studies
are

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
substantial when it relates to
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral and medical disorders there's
 
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
behavioral and medical disorders there's
no

01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%

psychiatric or behavioral professional
 
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.069 align:start position:0%

association
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire that i can
 
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.470 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire that i can
find

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
that supports
 
01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
that supports
cannabis

01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:22.549 align:start position:0%
cannabis
commercialization

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
commercialization
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
from a public safety perspective the
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
troopers and the sheriffs and the police
 
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.829 align:start position:0%
troopers and the sheriffs and the police
officers

01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
deal with the aftermath of the wrecks on
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
the road the data is replete with
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
increased use
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
when states commercialize cannabis
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then it follows that increased
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
collisions occur
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
and increased fatalities on the roadways
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
occur that's what we have to look
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh if cannabis is commercialized
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and while
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses a prohibition
 
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.589 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses a prohibition
against

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
operating a motor vehicle while
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
consuming or vaporizing cannabis
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
we still struggle with no per se limit
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the amount of
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
thc the psychoactive ingredient
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
in cannabis that causes
 
01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:21.190 align:start position:0%
in cannabis that causes
these

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
these
wrecks

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
so in those states that have legalizing
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
commercialized cannabis such as colorado
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
and nevada
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
oregon and washington
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
they have per se limits that allow law
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to charge there's
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
a threshold of nanograms per milliliter
 
01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:40.630 align:start position:0%
a threshold of nanograms per milliliter
that

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
are in those state laws that allow
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
public safety to charge people here we
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
can't even today
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
with two fatalities
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the town of bedford both
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
having operators that were responsible
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
with significant quantities of thc and
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
their system we could not
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
successfully charge and convict those
 
01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.349 align:start position:0%
successfully charge and convict those
individuals

01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
for driving while impaired by cannabis
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
so we look forward to increase
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
collisions increase wrecks on the road
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
that our troopers and officers and
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
deputies will have to deal with
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
just for a moment
 
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.709 align:start position:0%
just for a moment
the

01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
notion that if the state enters into an
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
agreement to
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
distribute cannabis commercially that
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the illicit market will simply vanish
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
and go away
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
record and the information is replete
 
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.470 align:start position:0%
record and the information is replete
again

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
with every single state that has
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
commercialized cannabis the illicit
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
market has not gone away
 
01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
market has not gone away
the

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
economic forces that play in
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
the industry here will vanquish the
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
state's ability to be able to make
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
enough money
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
to pay for the regulation of cannabis
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
so from a public safety
 
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
so from a public safety
perspective

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
from a medical perspective from a
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
behavioral perspective
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
and particularly from a law enforcement
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
perspective as it relates to the illicit
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
black market
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
or the listed market for cannabis which
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
will not go away which will only
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
proliferate here
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do is you're going
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
to turn law enforcement
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
on its side
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
and essentially this will be the
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
volstead act in reverse
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
because in those states they have to
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
spend significant amount of money to be
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
able to control the illicit market just
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
in this past week the state of oregon
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
has dedicated 25 million dollars extra
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
has dedicated 25 million dollars extra
money

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement in the state of
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
oregon to address
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the significant problem with the illicit
 
01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
the significant problem with the illicit
market

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
market
and

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
and
production

01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
of illicit cannabis in the state of
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
oregon 25 million dollars we don't have
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of money in the state of new
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do that
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
not only do we not have the money we
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the troopers and sheriffs and
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have the police officers to do
 
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
we don't have the police officers to do
it

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
so um
with

01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
again in jackson county in oregon
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners have asked the
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
governor for the national guard to come
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
out and to address the proliferation of
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
the illicit black market
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
and finally let me just close by talking
 
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
and finally let me just close by talking
about

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
um the public sentiment with respect to
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
polls are kind of funny things as we all
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
know the results of a poll generally
 
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.189 align:start position:0%
know the results of a poll generally
are

01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
a reaction to the questions that are
 
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.310 align:start position:0%
a reaction to the questions that are
asked

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so often times when polls are made
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
with respect to legalization
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
the questions are not asked in a way
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
that provides the respondent with a
 
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
that provides the respondent with a
different

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
way of responding concerning options
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
emerson college
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
which just released a poll that shows
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the majority
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
of americans do not support they oppose
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
commercialization of cannabis when given
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
other eruptions here in the state of new
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire as you all well know
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
no one goes to jail let me repeat no one
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
goes to jail for possession of cannabis
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
on small personal use amounts here in
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire no one goes
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
to jail
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
people that need or want cannabis by way
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
of a prescription from a medical doctor
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
are able to get it
 
01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
are able to get it
so

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
given those options i dare say that if a
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
poll were commissioned again that the
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
results would be different
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
i ask you from a public safety
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
perspective consider
 
01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
perspective consider
the

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral and medical issues the
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
highway safety issues
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
and the law enforcement issues that we
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
are simply ill-prepared ill-equipped
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
in ill-funded
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
closing i'd just like to say that
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
in listening to representative abbott's
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh support for the bill that he is a
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
friend of law enforcement i i'd like to
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
say that here publicly
 
01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
say that here publicly
that

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
it seems that this bill
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
should have as a poster the dollar sign
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement officer with 43
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
years experience
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
we need to rip the dollar sign off and
 
01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
we need to rip the dollar sign off and
stop

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
talking only about revenue
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
and stop only talking about how much
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
money we're going to make
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
because in every state that's done that
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
they haven't made enough money to pay
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and take the dollar sign off and put a
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
public face
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
onto this bill
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
the public faces needs to be the faces
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
of young men and young women and
 
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.669 align:start position:0%
of young men and young women and
teenagers

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
teenagers
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
the dead bodies that officers and
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
troopers scrape off the road
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's the public face that needs to be
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill not not a dollar sign thank
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chief i'm going to recognize
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
myself for a question real quick um the
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor talked about
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
the difference between the uh illicit
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
market and the um
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
what you said was that in some in the
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
states that have done this they have
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
been unable to compete
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
with the illicit market
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
in order to drop them out of the
 
01:13:45.199 --> 01:13:46.630 align:start position:0%
in order to drop them out of the
business

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
are you aware whether or not
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
if they had a
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
if they were competitively pricing or if
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
they were adding a lot of tax in those
 
01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.149 align:start position:0%
they were adding a lot of tax in those
states

01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
um because the sponsors seem to make the
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
argument that if we if we don't tax it
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
it'll remain low and therefore more
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
attractive to the
 
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
attractive to the
consumer

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
thus driving away from the private
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
illicit market if you have any thoughts
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh yes i am
 
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh yes i am
aware

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are various models
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
that are being used in california oregon
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of washington uh all of
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
those involve some degree of licensing
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
and taxation i believe that there is a
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement in
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
maine and massachusetts
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the tax component in
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
either one of those two states but
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
certainly there was a tax component in
 
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
certainly there was a tax component in
vermont

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
in in vermont's first year
 
01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:49.270 align:start position:0%
in in vermont's first year
of

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
legal commercialization
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
their revenue production projections in
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
vermont fulfill
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
significantly short of what they
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
anticipated alaska was the same
 
01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
anticipated alaska was the same
california's

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
california's
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis commercialization has failed
 
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
cannabis commercialization has failed
miserably

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
miserably
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
everyone is losing money in the state of
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
california they
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
consistently revise their revenue
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
production projections down
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
but again the california model
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
does involve significant licensing costs
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
and significant taxation costs here uh
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the model that's proposed by
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative abbas there still needs
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
to there still will be a market
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh component a supply and demand and
 
01:15:35.199 --> 01:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
uh component a supply and demand and
certainly

01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
since the state is not going to enter
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
into the manufacture
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
of cannabis they're going to have to buy
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
it from someone
 
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
it from someone
and

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
those particular folks
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
that are going to be manufacturing
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis for sale and the state adopts
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
some degree of liability when it sells a
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
product does it not
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
that that product is free of harmful
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals that has been tested
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's regulated
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
the state's selling a product just like
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol alcohol is tested and regulated
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
and is deemed
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
free of harmful chemicals
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
as the state sells it
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's a cost someone is going to have
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for that cost
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
so the market forces and play in all the
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
states while different are still going
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
to be in play here
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that the people that
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
manufacture marijuana for sale
 
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
manufacture marijuana for sale
that

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
be concerned about paying social
 
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.669 align:start position:0%
be concerned about paying social
security

01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be concerned about
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
paying workers comp they don't have to
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
be concerned about the environmental
 
01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
be concerned about the environmental
effects

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
effects
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
paying for water paying for electricity
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
and paying wages
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with the market
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
they will always
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
always be able to undersell and undercut
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
and eviscerate
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
a legal market because the legal market
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
as a good representative indicated
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
is built upon the premise that is going
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
to make a lot of money and we're going
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
to solve a lot of other problems it just
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen it's not it's not true
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
i was looking on page five of your
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
handout that you gave us and it talks
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
about uh suicide
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
talk ecology if i can say that word
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
right uh results by age group in 2019
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's from colorado
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of surprised me and there is a
 
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
what kind of surprised me and there is a
question

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
is the alcohol and marijuana suicide is
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
about the same you know 51
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
well i guess marijuana was 28 to 51
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
to uh
alcohol

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
can you get the results
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
before colorado
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana and can you guess
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
the results for what new hampshire is
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
i can try to get those results for you
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
mr representative and i will
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'll try to contact my colleagues in
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
colorado um
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
there may be some charts that are
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
publicly available that
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
show the increase in
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i think the chart that you have in my
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
handout uh depicts two age groups i
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
think correct it does right okay yeah
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
and there is a little bit of disparity i
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
think by one percent of an increase in
 
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.750 align:start position:0%
think by one percent of an increase in
suicide

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
with cannabis and then as
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
an alcohol in one of the age groups
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
correct i think on the chart if i recall
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
by memory
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
there is a chart that's available i
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
think that does depict colorado's
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
completed suicides
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
before and after legalization i'll try
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
to get you that chart with respect to
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately on we're not going to be
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
able to get those numbers and the reason
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
why is because suicides in the state of
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire unless there are there are
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
some very unusual circumstances
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the contextual nature
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the death
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
those are not those suicides typically
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
do not go to the office of the chief
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
medical examiner
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
and there are no toxicology reports on
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
i wish there were i i wish that
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
you would pass a law that would require
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
cost money
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
that to require a toxicology report for
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
completed suicides of all age groups so
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we could look at
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
what those numbers were when i was in
 
01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.630 align:start position:0%
what those numbers were when i was in
philadelphia

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
philadelphia
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
as the agent in charge for pennsylvania
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
we did look at those numbers
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of pennsylvania and in the
 
01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
in the state of pennsylvania and in the
city

01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
and at that time we were most concerned
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
about benzodiazepines
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
involved in suicide and the numbers we
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
showed for both marijuana and
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
testimony you're very informational on
 
01:20:32.719 --> 01:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
testimony you're very informational on
that

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
at bedford high school if you can answer
 
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.470 align:start position:0%
at bedford high school if you can answer
this

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
how much alcohol is there compared to
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana being used by the students if
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know and what are you trying to do
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
to slow that down
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotally i can tell you that
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
since we've gone back to in-person
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
learning this year
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we've had a number
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
what's that number i
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally so um this is i look at
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
every single incident every single day
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the town of bedford for 11 years so i
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
have these i have a conception of what
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
it is a hard number maybe not
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
but uh we've had
 
01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
but uh we've had
more

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
cases involving vaping
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
of cannabis products
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
and possession of cannabis products in
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
bedford high school
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
than we have in alcohol as a matter of
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
fact i can't recall
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
i can't recall a case in recent memory
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh over the past three or four or five
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
years where we've had a case involving
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
alcohol at bedford high school but we
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
have significant numbers
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
are they as high
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
as manchester or nashua certainly not
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
but they are concerning numbers in fact
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
we just had a few over the past couple
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
of weeks
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
at bedford high school and those were
 
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
at bedford high school and those were
vaping

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
vaping
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh situations involving vaping of
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis there was a chart in the
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
handout that shows a significant
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
increase uh and concerned with respect
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
to vaping of cannabis by young people
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
and on an increase when
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis has been commercialized
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
chief for taking the testimony or taking
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
the question in for your testimony so
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
i live in dover and we have ample
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to buy cannabis legally
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
most of the state population is within a
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
half hour of illegal canada's business
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
frightful

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
frightful
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
predictions you made about what might
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
happen have you seen
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
evidence to bear out
 
01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
evidence to bear out
that

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's already happening because we know
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
that this is already accessible to most
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
of our state well sure i i would agree
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your for your question
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm going to try to answer
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
it this way for you
 
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.910 align:start position:0%
it this way for you
um

01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
if you ever heard the the term spill
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
over crime
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're dealing with in a
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
new way with respect to being
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
the 101st airborne
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
of new england 101st airborne was
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
surrounded by the germans at the battle
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the bulge
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
and we seem to be surrounded here in new
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire by states that have
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
commercialized cannabis
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
and so there's a spillover effect
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
often spar with the various chiefs of
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
the manchester police department of
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
spill over crime from manchester into
 
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.709 align:start position:0%
spill over crime from manchester into
bedford

01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
bedford
 
01:23:56.719 --> 01:23:57.750 align:start position:0%
bedford
um

01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
and so the same effect occurs here and
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
so in direct response to your question
 
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.790 align:start position:0%
so in direct response to your question
yes

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the states that surround
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
us do have an impact
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
on the safety welfare and health
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
of the granite state and particularly in
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
your area
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
and that's unfortunate
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
because maine
 
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.350 align:start position:0%
because maine
and

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.390 align:start position:0%
and
vermont

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the state
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't apparently taken a good look at
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
what the effects are
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
associated with commercialization as it
 
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.669 align:start position:0%
associated with commercialization as it
has

01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
unrolled itself if you will in
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
colorado and washington
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
and oregon so yes there's a spillover
 
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
and oregon so yes there's a spillover
effect

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
chief thank you
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase that so the prediction
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
you if i understood correctly you made a
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
number of predictions about what would
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
happen in our state if this product
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
became legal
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the point i was trying to get to is
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
that this product is legal
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
in every state surrounding new hampshire
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
and that would suggest we know new
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents consume this product
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they purchase legally
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
and have you seen evidence and what
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
evidence exists
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
to bear out the predictions you made
 
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
to bear out the predictions you made
since

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
the activity you described is already
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
happening in the state well to the
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
extent that i could talk about my
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
experience in the town of bedford we've
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
had a number of cases involving people
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts transiting through
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
just as i'm sure your police department
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
has in dover
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
from maine
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
traveling from massachusetts through
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
bedford to
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%

01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%

that are still illegal
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
and again that's the spill over crime
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
effect the prediction that i make is
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
and increases in
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle collisions and fatalities
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
in those cities so yes we've seen an
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
increase already as a result of being
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
surrounded by those states
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
but if
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
commercialized in new hampshire we will
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
see an even greater increase based on
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
the data that we've seen in other states
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%

on the bill
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
the bill legalizes the recreational sale
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
and use of cannabis
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
and previous bills on this legislation
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
of cannabis
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
have suggested creating a separate
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%

associated with legalization
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to bolt on the sale and
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
licensure responsibilities to the liquor
 
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.189 align:start position:0%
licensure responsibilities to the liquor
commission

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
and establishes the responsibility to
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
set up retail store operation systems
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the provisions within the bill
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%

and provide the general fund with
revenues

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
that will be earmarked for various
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and public health and law
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement functions
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the commission takes no position
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
on which organizational approach
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the legalization would be the most
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
effective if the bill were to become law
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
and the commission does not endorse this
 
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
and the commission does not endorse this
bill

01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
and takes no position
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the policy questions that are part of
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
questions you might have about the
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal worksheet we have provided

there you see no questions i give you a
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee now calls lieutenant bill
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for hearing my
 
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for hearing my
testimony

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
many of the same uh concerns that the
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
division of state police has
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
have already been addressed by chief
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
prefonsky in his testimony
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
but we just would like to go on record
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
to say that if if this bill was passed
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
if the legalization of marijuana
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
does take place we do believe that there
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
will be an increase in
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
the potential of crimes an increase in
 
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
the potential of crimes an increase in
the

01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
potential of impaired drivers and all
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
the things that go along with that
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
toxicology testing
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
an increase in
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
investigations involving the black
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
and any related crimes to
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis or
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
01:30:05.199 --> 01:30:06.790 align:start position:0%
those types of
organizations

01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's all i have that you've
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
covered covered most of it
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
um could you could you possibly just
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
repeat the last sentence into the mic we
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
really didn't pick up anything you said
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
there yeah that's fine um and i
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for that uh representative
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
um the the division of state police uh
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
just wants to go on record for this bill
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
most of the things were covered by chief
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
profonsky the concerns that we have
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
but the increase in impaired drivers the
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
increase in potential investigations
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
involving black market sales will have
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
an impact on law enforcement and the
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
public safety of our state
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%

there's been some talk
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
about and i think you even brought it up
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
that there could be more illegal
 
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.189 align:start position:0%
that there could be more illegal
activity

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know with illegal marijuana
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
i know the state
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
collects about 350 plus million dollars
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
is there illegal activity
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the state with alcohol
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know there's people selling it and
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know out of their trunk and
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know for illegally you know trying
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
to avoid taxes and everything else and
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
making it cheaper
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
i personally have not dealt with uh with
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
a situation like that i don't have uh
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't have any knowledge
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you but you do have knowledge that
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
there is illegal activity with marijuana
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
or there's going to be an increase in
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
illegal activity with marijuana
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
that start that that's our opinion that
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
we believe that that
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
possibility exists that there will be an
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions thank
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%

and uh legal cannabis is is not
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
really an issue amongst my uh direct
 
01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:41.750 align:start position:0%
really an issue amongst my uh direct
constituents

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.790 align:start position:0%

um

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's been over 40 years since it's
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
an issue i really cared about but
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
um i i have cared consistently
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
about the role of government and the
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
role of government in
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh intervening in the individual lives
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
of citizens
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
and this is an example i think of
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
government needing to reassess
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
its relationship to the people relative
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
to their
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
their freedom to interact with a plant
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
whether 1598 is exactly the right way to
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
go or not i'll leave that to the
 
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
go or not i'll leave that to the
committee

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
but as it was mentioned uh we're
 
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
but as it was mentioned uh we're
literally

01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
literally
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
surrounded like the 101st airborne
 
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.110 align:start position:0%
surrounded like the 101st airborne
division

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
by states that it
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
where recreational marijuana is
 
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
where recreational marijuana is
legal

01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:34:37.679 --> 01:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
legal
and

01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
it was described as spillover crime
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
i would describe it as
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
we are now intentionally
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
enabling and
 
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.830 align:start position:0%
enabling and
preferring

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
preferring
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
a black market
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
to service the demands of the people who
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
want to use cannabis
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
and black markets are bad for a lot of
 
01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
and black markets are bad for a lot of
reasons

01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.629 align:start position:0%
reasons
um

01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
most of them i i'm sure the committee
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
members individually know black markets
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
are not good
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
they vomit crime uh and other
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
systems abuses
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
so um but i think we have a new threat
 
01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.229 align:start position:0%
so um but i think we have a new threat
from

01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
the black market and that is
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
we have so much fentanyl pouring over
 
01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.390 align:start position:0%
we have so much fentanyl pouring over
our

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
southern borders
 
01:35:30.639 --> 01:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
southern borders
that

01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
in other states it's become
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
common to lace
 
01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.189 align:start position:0%
common to lace
uh

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
a street pot with fentanyl and
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's a very dangerous thing it's a
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
great way to get somebody addicted it's
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
also a good way to accidentally kill
 
01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
also a good way to accidentally kill
people

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so i i think
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
we're now hitting a
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
public health aspect of having
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana that's available
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
that people know is not adulterated
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i i think we should be doing this i i
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if i said i was four to 1598
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
certainly in support of the
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
general direction
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
a year now three years ago we had a bill
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
in-home cultivation
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
and i had an opportunity to talk to
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
the most senior elected official
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
representing the state of new hampshire
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that individual
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
said to me that in-home cultivation i
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
know that's not the point of this bill
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
but just the the i think the quote is
 
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.149 align:start position:0%
but just the the i think the quote is
apt

01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
apt
 
01:36:42.159 --> 01:36:43.109 align:start position:0%
apt
um

01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
that that individual said if we allowed
 
01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
that that individual said if we allowed
this

01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
there would be chaos
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
and that's when i said
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
to him
 
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.310 align:start position:0%
to him
um

01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of people refer to that chaos as
 
01:36:56.639 --> 01:36:57.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of people refer to that chaos as
freedom

01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.070 align:start position:0%
and so
um

01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
i've thought about
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
that exchange for two three years now
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
and i really do think uh the attitude
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
that we have to
 
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
that we have to
control

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
people's experiences with a plant
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
the times the times past
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know talking to my dad before he
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
died you know pot in his uh uh social
 
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.350 align:start position:0%
died you know pot in his uh uh social
group

01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
was popular in 1948
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay this isn't really going anywhere so
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take questions if there
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is frank kennedy
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm the policy director with the aclu of
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about a couple things
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
around racial disparities and just the
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
overall impact of marijuana
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
criminalization on people but uh after
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
hearing the previous testimony i just
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct the record on a few
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
issues that i think would be important
 
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.229 align:start position:0%
issues that i think would be important
first

01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me the witness could you possibly
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
speak more directly into the mike and
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
louder please we're not picking you is
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
that better that's much better thank you
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
i apologize um
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
remember back to when legalization
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
efforts first uh first got started with
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
colorado and washington state and what
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
we heard from those opposing those
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
efforts was what we heard earlier in
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that would increase youth use
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
to increase traffic fatalities it would
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
increase crime and now we have the
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
benefit of data we have the benefit over
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
a decade of data in some circumstances
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen is those projections
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
have not borne fruit
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so i just really want us to focus on
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
what actually the data shows and so
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
particularly i know there was a lot of
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
conversation about youth use um
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
there was a study and all these are
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
cited in the testimony or in the handout
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
i gave you all
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
but there was a study in the journal of
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
american medical association uh back in
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
july of 2019 that found that
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana laws were
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
associated with an eight percent
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in the odds of youth marijuana
 
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.709 align:start position:0%
decrease in the odds of youth marijuana
use

01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
and a nine percent decrease in the
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
amount of frequent marijuana use by
 
01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.830 align:start position:0%
amount of frequent marijuana use by
youth

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so again the data does not support
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that moving towards
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
recreational use in new hampshire would
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
increase traffic fatalities increase
 
01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.950 align:start position:0%
increase traffic fatalities increase
crime

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
increase youth use etc
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
it was also argued there'd be some type
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
of spillover effect of crime and so i
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
just also want to clarify the record on
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you go back
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the last three years of data
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
we have in
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in terms of group a crime
 
01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in terms of group a crime
rates

01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
crime has reduced between 2018 and 2020
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%

01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so if there was some type of a
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
spillover effect i assume we would see
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
that in the data the data shows the
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
opposite in fact
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so getting back to the core of my uh
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
concerns with marijuana criminalization
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
so a single marijuana rest you know we
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
have we've we've definitely reduced the
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
number of people being arrested we've
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
gone from about
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
2 800 arrests or so
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
to about 1400 arrests or 1500 arrests in
 
01:40:55.199 --> 01:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
to about 1400 arrests or 1500 arrests in
2020

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
but for each of those marijuana arrests
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
the collateral consequences can be huge
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
while they may not go to jail if they're
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
a kid on student financial delay they
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
can lose their student financial aid
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
they can lose access to housing
 
01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:10.070 align:start position:0%
they can lose access to housing
employment

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
the collateral consequences can live
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
with someone for a long long time after
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
arrest and so again this is something
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
that is harming the residents of our
 
01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
that is harming the residents of our
state

01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
in addition the aclu conducted an
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
economic analysis of marijuana
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition in 2010 using 2010 numbers
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was spending about 6.5
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars every year on just the
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement of marijuana laws of
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
possession laws not sales possession
 
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.709 align:start position:0%
possession laws not sales possession
laws

01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
and so because all those arrests revolve
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
a judge clerk law enforcement officers
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors etc
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
we have about half the number of arrests
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
in 2020 as we did back in 2010 and so
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're spending still about 3.25 million
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
dollars every year on just the
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement of marijuana possession laws
 
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
enforcement of marijuana possession laws
alone

01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
and again the enforcement of marijuana
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
laws across the country new hampshire
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
not excluded are enforced with a
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
staggering racial bias
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
in 2020 black people were 4.8 times more
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
likely to be arrested for marijuana
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
possession than white people
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
and marijuana is a great opportunity for
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
us to actually look at racial
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
disparities because we know from
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
national data that black people and
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
white people use marijuana at roughly
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
the same rate and so we can do apple's
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
samples comparison
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
and so in 2010 we were at 2.6 times more
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
likely so not only had we have a
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
horrible disparity but our disparity has
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
gone in the wrong direction by 46
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the last decade
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
and in some jurisdictions in manchester
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
manchester half of all marijuana arrests
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
since 2020 were black people
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's a 13.9 times more likely rate in
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
manchester city pd and conquered 5.8
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
times more likely
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so again we think this this law
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we think there would be some
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
improvements to the law around edibles
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
around personal consumption and personal
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
growing but we think this law is very
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
important this bill is very important we
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
supported it and thank you all for your
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
i had a question uh about your studies
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you go online you can look at many
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
many studies that colorado was legalized
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana a long time ago
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
it cost them
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
more money than they generate
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
and you said that that's not true
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
the cost arguments i was making are in
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the enforcement of marijuana
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
possession laws
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
and so the prosecutors tops you know etc
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that fall and so our study our
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
analysis that the aclu did back in 2013
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
looking at 2010 data was purely around
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of prohibition of marijuana
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
possession and not revenue collection et
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
cetera okay
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill has been sold as a weapon
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah this is being sold as a revenue
 
01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.669 align:start position:0%
yeah this is being sold as a revenue
maker

01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
maker
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
but in colorado it costs 4.50 for every
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
dollar generated so it's not a revenue
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
maker in colorado i have not seen that
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
i've seen the opposite in terms of
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
there you go for the questions thank you
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%

and your tremendous effort in fighting
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
for cannabis legalization for new
 
01:45:44.239 --> 01:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
for cannabis legalization for new
hampshire

01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
we recognize and appreciate your hard
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
work and we're here to support you
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start by saying that we
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
generally support legalization at a
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
minimum but of course we prefer to see
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
legalized commerce come with it
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
if that's in the form of a bill that's
 
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.430 align:start position:0%
if that's in the form of a bill that's
great

01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
if that's in the form of a
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment so be it
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
over the last few years i've had the
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read many of the
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
candidates cannabis legalization bills
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
much of the discussion seems to be
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
focused on projected windfalls for the
 
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.629 align:start position:0%
focused on projected windfalls for the
state

01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
however in our opinion this limited view
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't even begin to tell the entire
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
economic story
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis touches almost every industry
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
from agriculture and farming
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
to trades and transportation
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
to administrative and professional staff
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for all who wish
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's a much larger tangible economic
 
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.629 align:start position:0%
there's a much larger tangible economic
benefit

directly
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%

01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is about real economic opportunity
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
for our residents
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
and in our opinion failure to bring the

hampshire
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a failure to provide more paths to
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
prosperity for our residents
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
and what this means
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
should be considered as you debate these
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
bills in these constitutional amendments
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
in my capacity as the founder of the new
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire cannabis association and in my
 
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire cannabis association and in my
work

01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
on a national level i've spent years
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
talking with operators all over the
 
01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
talking with operators all over the
country

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
owners in california tell me how over
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
regulation and taxation is devastating
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
their industry and propping up the black
 
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.629 align:start position:0%
their industry and propping up the black
market

01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
operators in states with artificially
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
limited licenses share this cause
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
license fees to mushroom to a million
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in some cases
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
my contacts in massachusetts they laugh
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
at us they don't think that we have the
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
will that we can work together to
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis in the state
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's high time that we prove
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
them wrong
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
but in doing so we only have one chance
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
to create an adult use market
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
and it's important that we get it right
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
focus on low regulation low barriers to
 
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.030 align:start position:0%
focus on low regulation low barriers to
entry

01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
entry
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
low taxes
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
these are going to be critical and are
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
critical in our formulation
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we're supportive of
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
legalization generally
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
however i'd like to share the following
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
as a special message to our legislators
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
and our governor
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
no one really wants to be forced to
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis from the government
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
the retail experience should be as
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
varied and unique as the operators who
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
run them
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
if the government wants to fairly
 
01:48:36.639 --> 01:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
if the government wants to fairly
compete

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
compete
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the sale of cannabis
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
in the free market that would be fine
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
in fact i think having cannabis
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
available at something at the equivalent
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
of a state liquor store
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
is an option that many consumers would
 
01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.590 align:start position:0%
is an option that many consumers would
choose

01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that consumers
 
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
should be required to purchase from the
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
government more importantly our
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
residents deserve the opportunity to
 
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.709 align:start position:0%
residents deserve the opportunity to
compete

01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
compete
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
in the retail space
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of the consumers workers
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
and entrepreneurs of the state
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
we request that you amend hp 1598 to
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
ensure free market competition and
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the retail segment of the
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
you seem to be right on top of the
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
farming really have a good handle on
 
01:49:30.159 --> 01:49:31.270 align:start position:0%
farming really have a good handle on
that

01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
50 years ago
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
an organic material called tobacco
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
farmers in the south started selling
 
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
farmers in the south started selling
tobacco

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it was supposed to have a calming
 
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
and it was supposed to have a calming
effect

01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
and people were supposed to feel good
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
about smoking cigarettes now we know 50
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
60 years later cancer is increased by it
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis in smoke is any different than
 
01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.149 align:start position:0%
cannabis in smoke is any different than
tobacco

01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
i do in most cigarettes i think there's
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
over what 20 40 different chemicals that
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
are in there
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
anytime you combust
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
an organic material that there are
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
secondary effects from the smoke in the
 
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.430 align:start position:0%
secondary effects from the smoke in the
carbon

01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
but that's also why edibles are
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
important that's why vaping is important
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's why access to
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
other methods of consumption are
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
important yes
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
there will be no further questions thank
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
sir do you have a copy of that written
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh we are currently neutral on hb 1598
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
however we are in support of ending
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis prohibition and we commend the
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this legislation and the
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee for their
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
work to finally try and end uh this sort
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
of charade that's going on with new
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire being
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
surrounded by legal cannabis states on
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
an island
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
of prohibition if you will
 
01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.430 align:start position:0%
of prohibition if you will
um

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
although we'll likely be last in new
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
england to legalize cannabis for for
 
01:51:32.639 --> 01:51:33.589 align:start position:0%
england to legalize cannabis for for
adults

01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
for recreational use we have the
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn lessons from uh the
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
surrounding states of what what went
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
well what did not work well
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh and and we do i do have some written
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
testimony to hang it hand out afterwards
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
of just some do's and don'ts of lessons
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we've picked up from around the
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
country of of what's to work to in a
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
roll out to a legal market and what uh
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
some of the top line issues we have with
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
this bill really have to do with
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
competition and access
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
to the market uh currently hp 1598 as
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
only allows sales in uh state-run stores
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're concerned about the market
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
being able
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh to get off the ground uh
 
01:52:25.199 --> 01:52:26.229 align:start position:0%
uh to get off the ground uh
while

01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
state the the liquor commission will
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
have to go through a rule making process
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
there will be an extended time where
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
they have to find
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
leases for storefronts things of that
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
sort and and
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis is not as simple as many
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
make it out to be difficult to grow and
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's very expensive to open up and get
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
started at cultivation
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
facility uh our goal should be
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
to quickly reduce the influence of the
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
the black market
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and uh make sure that we're out
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
competing our neighbors
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh to do this we need cultivators to get
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
started and
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
start growing product and producing
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
product so that we're increasing our
 
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.629 align:start position:0%
product so that we're increasing our
supply

01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and therefore lowering price
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh we should
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
allow cultivators to sell directly to
 
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
allow cultivators to sell directly to
consumers

01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
consumers
outside

01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
out of their their facilities
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that we we increase that supply
 
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
so that we we increase that supply
before

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
state stores open so that it's an easy
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
roll out and and we avoid any
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
roll out that's fraught with problems
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
competition and supply is what lowers
 
01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
competition and supply is what lowers
price

01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
price
uh

01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
and and we believe that this is a a way
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh find a middle ground to having state
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
stores but having that access to the
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
market before those those are open
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
lastly the safest way to consume
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis is edibles uh
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering around them but it
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
you you
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
when you take an edible you know exactly
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
the dosage amount that you're getting
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
and you're avoiding any consequences
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
from consuming cannabis through through
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
us smoking which obviously any time you
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
burn organic products there there can be
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
consequences with that so we encourage
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to look into
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
allowing the state stores
 
01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
allowing the state stores
to

01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
sell edible products to
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
all consumers of age
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the states stores
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
and to allow those manufacturing
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
facilities to distribute
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh out of their facilities for those
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
same exact reasons as the cultivators so
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we increase supply lower price and
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
are prepared to open
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
those uh those recreational stores
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh and for those reasons uh
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
we encourage the committee to look into
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh maybe amending the bill uh but again
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
we commend the committee uh for your
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
work to finally try and solve this
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
problem uh with that i'd be happy to
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you for your
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for your time
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
we now call emily shanahan
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
good morning i'd like to start by
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
thanking the community for the
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today in opposition
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
to hb 1598
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
my name is emily shanahan and i'm a new
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire certified prevention
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%

hampshire chapter of smart approaches to
marijuana

01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
there's been a significant
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
evidence i'm sorry to interrupt you
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
could you please speak directly into the
 
01:55:55.679 --> 01:55:56.390 align:start position:0%
could you please speak directly into the
mic

01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
mic
 
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.669 align:start position:0%
mic
yes

01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
is that better okay there's been a
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
significant body of evidence that
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the health safety and
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
economic harms of marijuana legalization
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
far outweigh the perceived benefits
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
we have both decriminalized and
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana for medical purposes
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
so why do we now need to legalize for
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
with our state facing a pandemic opioid
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%

01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
we considering legalizing another

01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%

01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
virtually every medical and psychiatric
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%

01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%

are real and they're widespread

by legalizing and commercializing
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%

marijuana we are contributing to that
problem

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana use has been linked to
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety thoughts of suicide

01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
we need solutions not more problems
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
prevention is more urgent today than
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
ever before as treatment for youth is
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
almost non-existent
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
just recently one used in our central
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire region was admitted to a
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
local hospital for three weeks waiting
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
for a bed at hampton hospital for
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
inpatient treatment
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana potency has tripled in the
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
past 20 years and sends more youth to
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
treatment than any other drug
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
estimates from research suggest that
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
those who start using marijuana before
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
the age of 15
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
are 70 percent more likely to experience
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
addiction because their brains are
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
undergoing rapid development
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1598 designates 25 million dollars
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
from marijuana sale proceeds to
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and recovery but
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
why designate funds to a problem when
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're creating a problem that's
 
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.669 align:start position:0%
we're creating a problem that's
preventable

01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
let's just not create the problem at all
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
we need to prevent drug use and not
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
encourage it
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
some have raised the issue of growing
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
public support for legalization as
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
reflected in a unh poll
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
as of polling the answer depends on the
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
question that's asked
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
and this poll asked essentially a yes or
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
no question and compared marijuana with
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol and tobacco
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
but when voters were given a choice
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
between decriminalization
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
medical and recreational 53 percent of
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters opposed
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
commercialized marijuana as reflected in
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
a recent emerson college poll which you
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
have attached a better metric of public
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
support is the not in my backyard effect
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
government reports from the legal states
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
show 72 percent of municipalities in
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
colorado have banned pot shops 80 in

oregon the remaining legal states have
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
seen similar numbers
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
many people point out that we are
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
surrounded by legal states but does that
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
mean that we should join them
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is an oasis let's work
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%

01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in the statistics that
 
02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:04.709 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in the statistics that
you

02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
i've looked at the statistics um the raw
 
02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:13.830 align:start position:0%
i've looked at the statistics um the raw
numbers

02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't but i saw it doesn't
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
the respondents said that they were
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.830 align:start position:0%
opposed to
legalization

02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:25.030 align:start position:0%
legalization
um

02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
in fact the the poll that i looked at
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
showed that less than 14
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
of respondents said that they would like
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
to keep cannabis illegal
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
can you clarify do you have the actual
 
02:00:38.719 --> 02:00:47.109 align:start position:0%
can you clarify do you have the actual
yeah

02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
a chart with two bars on it
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
and one says full marijuana legalization
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
and the other one says other
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
non-legalization marijuana policies and
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the raw data for this
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
emergency poll
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:04.950 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
the

02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
um the actual possible responses that
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
someone could give on this poll where if
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
they support decriminalization if they
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
support medical cannabis
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
if they support legal legalization
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
the other option is that they could say
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
being opposed to legalization
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
and being in support of
 
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.550 align:start position:0%
and being in support of
decriminalization

02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
decriminalization
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and why four options
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
in this poll were boiled down to two
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
two bars on this chart it's it's very
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
confusing thank you for taking my
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
um so according to this poll um when
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
given those options that you had
 
02:01:54.719 --> 02:01:55.669 align:start position:0%
given those options that you had
mentioned

02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the people that were
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
polled chose that they were not they
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
were opposed to commercialization of
 
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.390 align:start position:0%
were opposed to commercialization of
marijuana

02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up please
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes but the
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative is reminded not to argue
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the witness
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the reminder
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
and thanks for allowing me to have a
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up it'll be my only one thank you
 
02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.189 align:start position:0%
follow-up it'll be my only one thank you
um

02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between selecting
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of three types of decriminalization
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between that and
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
opposing legalization in your opinion
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
in my opinion oftentimes a lot of people
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
get confused so when we asked the
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
question in this way by giving the full
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
options the respondents
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
said they were majority opposed to
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
commercialization of marijuana
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:58.310 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
you

02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%

we believe it is our responsibility to
 
02:04:16.639 --> 02:04:17.589 align:start position:0%
we believe it is our responsibility to
call

02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
attention to the growing science on the
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
risks of cannabis use and the urgent
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
need for informed decisions when
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
considering the impact of public safety
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
policy on on our children
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
the scary truth is our kids are in a
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and we are very worried our
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
region's 2019
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
central new hampshire yrbs survey
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
indicates that our youth reports
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
significantly higher levels of sadness
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
hopelessness and suicidal ideation than
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
statewide damages
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
local youth use of marijuana and vaping
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
have increased significantly putting our
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
children at even greater risk of income
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
youth marijuana use in our region is
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
significantly above statewide averages
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
with one in three youth regularly using
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
the drug
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
this hasn't always been the case
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
in 2015 our youth were significantly
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
below statewide averages in marijuana
 
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
below statewide averages in marijuana
use

02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
following the opening of the alternative
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
treatment center in plymouth we have
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
seen a 65
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
increase in use
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
youth are getting the message that
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana is medicine
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
so it must be good for
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
them when science tells us the exact
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
opposite is true
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana use is consistently linked to
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
poor mental health outcomes with youth
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
being at greater risk for anxiety
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
depression and and addiction
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
daily marijuana uses under age 17 are
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
less likely to graduate from high school
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
more likely to use other drugs more
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
likely to to develop addiction and more
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
likely to attempt suicide
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
high potency thc increases these risks
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
and our kids are getting the wrong

message from therapeutic cannabis and
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
recreational legalization will only
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
exacerbate this problem
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
no amount of legislative safeguards can
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
protect the most vulnerable among us
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%

in 2021 new hampshire poisoning control
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
received calls involving 22 children
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
under the age of five who were exposed
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
to marijuana
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
four of those calls involved toddlers

02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
keep it out of the hands of our teens
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
with legalization more cannabis
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
there will be more cannabis on the
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
ground resulting in more emergencies
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
we should be paying close attention to
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
the experience of legalized states
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%

who is on the uh new hampshire
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study the legalization and
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
taxation of marijuana i believe it was
 
02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
taxation of marijuana i believe it was
2018.

02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
we submitted that report
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
we spent a year
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
every every few weeks
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
listening to people from all over the
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
country that have legal
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis and marijuana programs
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
from colorado to massachusetts you name
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
it we talked to pretty much everybody we
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
can get a hold of
 
02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.229 align:start position:0%
can get a hold of
um

02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is pre teleconferencing recovered
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
so we had to do a lot of it that way so
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
we got a little experience doing that
 
02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
we got a little experience doing that
but

02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
anyway uh i checked off that i was not
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill in particular i
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
i'd rather say i'm neutral this bill the
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
way it's written but i am the my main
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
issue is the fact that the state would
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
have control over the sole sales of
 
02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
have control over the sole sales of
cannabis

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.589 align:start position:0%
cannabis
um

02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know there are about a quarter of
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
the states in this country are liquor
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
control states that sell
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know only sell they're the only ones
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell spirits
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
um there's some evidence that shows that
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
that does decrease uh drinking usage of
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
all kinds but it's not a very large
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
decrease in
drinking

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
cessation that not cessation but
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
drinking usage that's shown
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
like all those other states put the
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
liquor commission in charge of selling
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
it so we wouldn't have so many people
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
drinking alcohol
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
it was a response that the prohibition
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
has had when prohibition was repealed
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
back in 1933
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
to say okay well we can't stop it even
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
though everyone's not everyone but many
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
people are doing it and we can't enforce
 
02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
people are doing it and we can't enforce
it

02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
to keep problems with the current
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition it's it's happening and it's
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
unenforceable there are many people that
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
are using it that are never able to be
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
arrested for it and and rightfully so
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
because it's it's foolish to even try at
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
um we are this island of prohibition
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
surrounded by other states uh i don't
 
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:08.950 align:start position:0%
surrounded by other states uh i don't
think

02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
comparing us to uh you know those other
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
states to the nazis is actually a
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
relevant uh
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
comparison but
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
i like the idea that we are an island of
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
freedom and that's in that's uh that
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
would we were we could be an island of
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
freedom in in the rest of the country in
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
new england if we joined the other
 
02:11:29.599 --> 02:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
new england if we joined the other
states

02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
states
so

02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are some big some arguments we
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
always heard about why it shouldn't be
 
02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
always heard about why it shouldn't be
commercialized

02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
commercialized
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh big cannabis is always that word
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's thrown around we don't want to
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
commercialize it because more people
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
will get it
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
i talked to every single person that
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
came and testified at the liquor at the
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
study commission for this
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
that was against it i said you know are
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
kids having any problem getting it oh no
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere i was told
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
kids have no problem getting it's
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere it's in the schools it's easy
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
to buy it's actually easier
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
in some cases than to buy alcohol which
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
has to be carded in most of all
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
establishments in the state
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the other argument was that it's a
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
gateway drug people are using this and
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
going on to do other drugs now the
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
younger people do any substance whether
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's nicotine alcohol tobacco it is not
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
a good idea i'm not saying children or
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
young adults should do this i think you
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
should wait as long as possible i've
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
been recovering myself for over 30 years
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
i have a 15 year old son who has friends
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
that smoke and they drink more than
 
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
smoke than drink because it's harder for
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
them to get alcohol by the way
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
and he says well what about me what
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
should i do i said
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not even going to tell you not to do
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
it i'm going to tell you not to do it
 
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.589 align:start position:0%
it i'm going to tell you not to do it
now

02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
because it's you know i'm your dad and
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a good idea
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
but if you get to be older and you want
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
to do it give it a try but give it some
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
time because there are dangers
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
associated with it and i think this is
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
one thing that was missed by a lot of
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the debate
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
some people like to say it's a totally
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
harmless substance and others say it's
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
the you know going to cure cancer and
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
all these other things
 
02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
all these other things
it's

02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
neither of those things there's
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
something in between alcohol was also
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
considered medicinal for a long time
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
during prohibition
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
i was
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
talking to a former person from liquor
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
commission one of the enforcers
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers who actually has an
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
obsession an antique copy of a medicinal
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol prescription pad for the state
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so this is not a new
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
occurrence you know we've had medicinal
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol in the past we have medicinal
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
but we do have big cannabis already it's
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the in the form of illegal sales
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
it is completely unregulated they don't
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
check ids kids have no trouble getting
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
it from someone and you also hear about
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the gateway you know i talked about the
 
02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.589 align:start position:0%
the gateway you know i talked about the
gateway

02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
gateway
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
people think that if they start early
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to other have other
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
substance use problems as later in life
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
the earlier you start doing most
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
addictive substances it is true it is
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
harmful later in life
 
02:14:03.199 --> 02:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
harmful later in life
but

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of consensus on what
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
really is the gateway whether it's
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually something that causes this drug
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
causes that you could say everyone who
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
drinks milk becomes this is an adult
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
well it might be true but it doesn't
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean that it's a
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
a definite result of something happening
 
02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:21.910 align:start position:0%
a definite result of something happening
so

02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know the gateway is more likely that
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
people buy an illegal substance from
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
someone are more likely to buy another
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
illegal substance from that same person
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
so if someone is
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know i've
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't drink it anymore but i never
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
went into a bar and asked the bartender
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
to buy cocaine or marijuana they just
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
won't sell it to you because it's a
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
legal establishment if you talk to
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
someone who's selling cannabis on the
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
street and say hey do you know where i
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
can get some cocaine or fentanyl
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
they probably know that and i'm sure
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
they'll give you a referral you're not
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to see that in a regulated market
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's state or commercial and
 
02:14:56.239 --> 02:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
whether it's state or commercial and
retail

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
retail
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
we heard limiting licenses limiting
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
licenses would be a problem if the state
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
didn't do it it doesn't have to be a
 
02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
problem there's a way to do this
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
equitably to have people that are
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to operate any business in new
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire should be allowed to operate a
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis business in new hampshire i
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
think we looked at how long it would
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
take to to own a cannabis establishment
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the commission i think they talked
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
about maybe three years but my memory
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
might be off on that uh that's how long
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
it takes to be a state senator for
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
residency in new hampshire too so you
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
know it's a pretty high bar they've they
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
put for cannabis uh
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
establishments in the commission report
 
02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
establishments in the commission report
um

02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.079 --> 02:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
another just a couple of things i heard
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
from previous uh people testifying that
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to clear up uh we heard that
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're not required people that
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
are selling illicit substances the
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis and other things are not
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
required to pay taxes they absolutely
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
are required to pay taxes
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
um if you don't believe it just look at
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
al capone
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh he was nailed for tax evasion from
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
his illegal sales and if you look at the
 
02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:07.830 align:start position:0%
his illegal sales and if you look at the
uh

02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
the irs website they'll tell you that
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
you have to report and come from all
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
illegal activities whether it's you know
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis sales moonshine sex work
 
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
cannabis sales moonshine sex work
whatever

02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
you still have to report that income so
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
legitimate argument
 
02:16:23.679 --> 02:16:26.229 align:start position:0%
legitimate argument
um

02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
and i think less i mean i can keep going
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we're here all day so i'm sure i'll
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
fit in a few points later i know
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to go to lunch sometime
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
today and maybe dinner hopefully
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know fast food is very dangerous too
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know the last thing i want is for
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
the state to take over
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
fast food i mean he'd want to have a
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
granite burger you know this is not
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
something we need to have the state
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
controlling just because they think it's
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
in our best interest when
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
prohibition was repealed in 33 virginia
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
was the first state to
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh enact a liquor control state and the
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
governor at the time of virginia said
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
that and i'm paraphrasing but he said
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
that the you know now that the
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition has been appealed they have
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
to do something about it and the idea
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they were going to the vetted
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
proposed with the liquor control state
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
it actually decreases the amount of
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
options people have we talked we heard
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
about things like edibles and vaping
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
products and other things
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to sit here and debate
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
those with you today there's a lot of
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
science on both sides of this argument
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
but if you have the state selling a
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
monopoly state monopoly on something
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have limited resources
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have limited competition
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have other states that
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
will be ahead of the game in
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
the sense that they have more options to
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
supply the market
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want a black market and the
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
black market gets turned around too but
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's actually a gray market when you
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
have legalization but they buy illegally
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
and bring it from somewhere else legally
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
to an illegal state or even from the
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
state stores and sell it to someone else
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's considered a gray market i can't
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
answer questions later or even after
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee if anyone would like to speak
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
in a work session
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
i spent a lot of time studying this i'm
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
i've started several non-profits on the
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%

02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
organizations recovery and treatment
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
centers and i'm on the harm reduction
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%

policy director
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
um so if you have any questions i'd be
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
at some other time i'm sure but i'd be
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question and for your
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard a moment ago that
 
02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard a moment ago that
there's

02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh buyer's remorse in states that have
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
legalized this product sounds like
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
you've done some travel and you've
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
actually spoken to people in these
 
02:18:44.479 --> 02:18:45.349 align:start position:0%
actually spoken to people in these
states

02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
can you uh provide some context
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
as to if this is
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
a true thing
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh i i haven't we did we didn't travel
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
to most of these states we did travel in
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
the in states to the dispensaries
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
themselves the most it was remote
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
we talked to the the
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the pot the cannabis are from colorado
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
and members of the commission from
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and other places
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um at the time this is three years ago
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
remorse whatsoever that we heard from
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
any of these individuals as far as the
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
studies you hear about accidents and
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
things like that and teen usage uh i
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
don't agree with a lot of things you
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
heard in in reference to them being
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
drastically increased if anything uh
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
they decreased in colorado at that time
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
for for teen and young adult young usage
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
now there were increases in the in the
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
college age years range
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
but uh that wasn't a very significant
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase we heard increases of accidents
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
from an insurance study that was done
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
out in colorado and some other states in
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
that area
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh the details of that study didn't show
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
increased fatalities necessary that were
 
02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.550 align:start position:0%
increased fatalities necessary that were
directly

02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
caused by cannabis use they were
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
mostly fender benders and small and
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
there are more incidents reported
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and when something is legalized you do
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
get more incidents reported you're going
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
to have more insurance claims
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
so if you want to hear about access
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
reports from insurance companies they're
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
going to tell you we had more claims
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
because something is now
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to go to prison for it
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor or illegal in that
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
state and also with uh underage usage uh
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
we heard about hospitalization we heard
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
from in colorado specifically their
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
state medical director i believe it was
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
about hospitalizations for uh ingestion
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
of you know poisonings so to speak of
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the hospitals and how that
 
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.309 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the hospitals and how that
increased

02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
a huge amount in colorado and i the
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
number was
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise was a lot higher but if
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
you actually look at the number it was
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
not a very large number it was in the
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people going to the er
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
for cannabis no one died no one had uh
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences in any of those
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
cases in colorado
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i i mentioned a study that they
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
looked at there were over ten thousand i
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
forget the exact number but over ten
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
thousand uh calls to poison control
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
nationally before ingestion of a very
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous product that caused a lot of
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
people go to the hospital and almost
 
02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:12.389 align:start position:0%
people go to the hospital and almost
died

02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
died
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
um and that was
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
laundry detergent pots so that's
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
remember the tide pod stuff
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i asked them i said so in colorado
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
you have this many people how many do
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know how many tide pod
 
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
poisonings you've had in your state and
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
you think it's more than the cannabis
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions and he's kind of laughing
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
he's like well yeah it's probably a lot
 
02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:32.469 align:start position:0%
he's like well yeah it's probably a lot
more

02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have an exact number for
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
their state but it's it's kids get
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
themselves into all kinds of things i'm
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
all for safety measures to protect
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
children and to keep them from ingesting
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
ingesting laundry detergent turpentine
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
whatever there's a way to do it safely
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%

the possibility in 10 years

that they could

regulate numbers or even decrease in

eight points
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a risk we should take
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing an increase of not

only young adult use but adult use with
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%

our state will feel the ramifications
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it will hurt our youth our families
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and communities when we should be

youth are experiencing today
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
if we are to effectively address the
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
drug crisis we must work to increase
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
proper preventive profession messaging
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
and prevent

addiction for profit
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
not encourage it
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
science tells us that the developing

during the teen years
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
you will see the surge of drug use
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
during adolescence between the ages of
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
12 and 20 and then it tapers off during

the rest of the lifespan
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%

before turning 18 years of age
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
this illustrates the need for more
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
prevention not less
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
if we legalize and commercialize
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana we will be sending the wrong
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
message regarding risk factors and
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
opening the floodgates to increase

marijuana of today
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the costs are insurmountable
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%

state

risk of heroin addiction by three times
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
is a devastating miscalculation
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana will only
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
serve to add to the problem of addiction

officials and scientists every day
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
the potential of the future leaders of
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
our country could be stunted with
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
regular marijuana consumption through
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
these crucial developmental stages
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so i ask why should we allow this
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic substance to be
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
authorized for personal use when
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
statistics medical studies and data is
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
proving that our teenagers are becoming
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
more familiar with drugs
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
i am part of a generation that has been
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
coerced through media for drug use and
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
now possibly reinforced by state
 
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.990 align:start position:0%
now possibly reinforced by state
legislature

02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
we want to protect our youth in such
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
uncertain undetermined times the
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
potential the future holds their human
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
advancements may be way beyond our
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
increasing normality of marijuana will
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
have a detrimental impact to the
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
children of our future new hampshire has
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
the third highest drug rates in the
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
united states with being the only state
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
on the east coast not to
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana for recreational use
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
the united states drug enforcement
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
administration classifies marijuana as a
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
schedule one substance
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
schedule one substances have no accepted
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and official medical use and high
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
potential for abuse
 
02:30:57.910 --> 02:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
some other schedule one subjects in the
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
same category are heroin lsd and ecstasy
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
why are we encouraging the idea of a
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
drug in the same category as heroin one
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the biggest epidemics in the state of
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and permitting it for
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
personal use
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
another major concern over this
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization bill for the
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
yeast is the dependence or inability to
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
act independently without marijuana or
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
to become a regular occurrence
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
teenager years are notorious for making
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
bad decisions due to the fact that the
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
mesolimbic region of the brain is very
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
active during these years
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
the mesolimbic pathway has an embedded
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy of if it feels good to do it
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
again creating impulses and temptations
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
as it is releasing dopamine and
 
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
as it is releasing dopamine and
glutamate

02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
glutamate
 
02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
with these pleasurable neurotransmitters
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
released this causes a habit behind a
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
substance and that shows that our
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
teenagers do not fully take into full
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
consideration the consequences that
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
could happen because the fixation is on
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the substance that once made them feel
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
good again
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
the mental habits and stretch they can
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
put on the human mind could be a mess
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
especially for a teenager and according
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
to the yale medical institute
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
adolescents using marijuana while in the
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
age periods of 12 to 18 have a
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
significantly increased likelihood of
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
developing schizophrenia and numerous
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
your choice today could be the
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
difference between exposing our youth to
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
a messaging drug that can delay
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
cognitive development and promote
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous decision-making or it could be
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
an act of protection to guard the
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
adolescents of new hampshire from
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
harmful substances becoming normal thank
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you very
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
 
02:32:54.319 --> 02:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
testimony

02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
my name is neil hubacher and i'm the
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
director of cornerstone's church
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
ambassador network we're a growing
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
network of about 300 churches
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
um although we don't normally engage
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
directly in
 
02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
directly in
policy

02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
because of some recent developments uh
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the church ambassador network i just
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
felt compelled to share those and i am
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
testifying to be clear in opposition to
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
hb 1598.
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
the two developments that i wanted to
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
share with you our number one
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
part of our strategy last fall was just
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
to begin connecting with senators just
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
small groups of in-district pastors
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
connecting with their senators primarily
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
just to honor them and say thank you for
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
your work
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
we managed to hit about 12 of them so
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
far five democrats seven republicans
 
02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:46.790 align:start position:0%
far five democrats seven republicans
and

02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
again the purpose was mainly
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
relationship it wasn't based centrally
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
on policy but we would always ask the
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
senator hey what are your biggest
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
concerns for your district you know for
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
your 50 54 000 people you know what are
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
your concerns and
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
almost every senator in their top three
 
02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
concerns in their district they were
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the addiction crisis
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
mental health and the addiction crisis
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so in light of that and actually in
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
light of i think it's uh deb narrow of
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
katie and our colleagues at kd you know
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
they've made that link between the
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
addiction crisis and mental health these
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
are big concerns and so in light of that
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
it just seems like this bill at this
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
time is ill-advised
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
the second development that the church
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
ambassador network has
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
experienced in recent months is
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
we started a collaborative so some of
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
the pastors of these 300 churches have
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
gotten together it's a mental health
 
02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.150 align:start position:0%
gotten together it's a mental health
collaborative

02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it was primarily a response to the
 
02:34:54.640 --> 02:45:19.190 align:start position:0%
and it was primarily a response to the
dukovic

02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
so the committee i am a little bit too
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
ambitious on drafting the original bill
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i will be focusing on the amendment
 
02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:27.349 align:start position:0%
so i will be focusing on the amendment
today

02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that the new
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire house has come to a consensus
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
on marijuana
 
02:45:34.389 --> 02:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
and that it should be legalized in this
 
02:45:34.399 --> 02:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
and that it should be legalized in this
state

02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
our current issue
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
is working out these details
 
02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
do we want to tax cannabis sales do we
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
want to stay monopoly on sales etc
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
as we have heard in previous bills today
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it's a backup
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
plan in case we do not come into an
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
agreement on legalization and pass it
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
this session
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is further
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
decriminalize marijuana possession
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
by removing any references to
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors for possession
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
it lowers the initial fine from 100
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
to 50
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
and lowers all subsequent fines from 300
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
and this would increase the possession
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
limit from three quarters of an ounce to
 
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
a full ounce
 
02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
this also fixes what i believe was an
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
overlooked issue in the rsa that makes
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
it so that individuals between the age
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
of 18 and 21
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
can be charged with a misdemeanor upon
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
their first possession offense
 
02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that we should
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
not be charging our young adults with
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
their whole life ahead of them with a
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for simply possessing a
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
small amount of marijuana
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
these are all the things that i believe
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
and hope we can agree on
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
with that i asked the bill to pass this
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill with an ought to pass
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i will take any
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
questions the community might have thank
 
02:46:53.359 --> 02:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
questions the community might have thank
you

02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:02.710 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
i just have a simple question i can't
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
find in your
 
02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:07.830 align:start position:0%
find in your
bill

02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
how you would prevent
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
or what you would do to prevent
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
youth from using it
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know once it's out there
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
you no penalty to take it
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
you have to find some way
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
to not transfer that to
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
the younger people
 
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative and uh
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
is just a very minor change it keeps the
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
current statute as it is so there's no
 
02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:43.269 align:start position:0%
current statute as it is so there's no
changes

02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh addressing that issue uh specifically
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh there is still a fine in place and
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's still uh the violation does go
 
02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:54.469 align:start position:0%
there's still uh the violation does go
up

02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
in severity but uh
 
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address that issue
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
specifically and how it gets into the
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls representative
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
committee

02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of this bill and i just
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to let members of the committee
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
know i said
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
far less than one minute
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
for my testimony i used to just support
 
02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana and
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
my first term as a member of this house
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
as i saw that we're being inundated with
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
more and more bills
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes as many as a dozen bills house
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
and senate uh
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
per session that it's using up an
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of time so
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just the hassle and
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
aggravation that i saw medical marijuana
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
patients going through
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
that convinced me that we needed to just
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana outright
 
02:49:02.070 --> 02:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was the the amount of time that it's
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
eating up for the legislature so for
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
that reason i would i would ask you to
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
support this bill and support uh
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
decriminalization or even legalization
 
02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
decriminalization or even legalization
outright

02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls lieutenant bill
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you committee again for hearing my
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just for the record i'm
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
lieutenant bill bright with new
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
as with the other bills that
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
decriminalize or
 
02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:37.830 align:start position:0%
decriminalize or
legalize

02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
legalize
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana or cannabis
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
we'll just take the same position that
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
we believe that there will be challenges
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
that come along with these
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
increased use
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
increased availability will lead to
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
increased use
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that will
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
lead to increased exposure to our
 
02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.710 align:start position:0%
lead to increased exposure to our
children

02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
children
increased

02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
issues with impaired drivers and so
 
02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
issues with impaired drivers and so
forth

02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now close the
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%

the cannabis

02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%

02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:40.870 align:start position:0%
still because i know there was a bill
before

02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%

02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
sugar hill and i'm here to offer house
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%

cannabis
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's a bill that's time has come
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
since 2018 10 states
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
have passed legal adult use cannabis
 
02:57:51.030 --> 02:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
right that's
 
02:57:52.710 --> 02:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
roughly three and a half years ten
 
02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
roughly three and a half years ten
states

02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
for our neighbors next door vermont
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
then michigan and illinois
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 on election day in arizona
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
montana new jersey and then added into
 
02:58:05.279 --> 02:58:06.790 align:start position:0%
montana new jersey and then added into
2021

02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%

new york virginia new mexico and
 
02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:10.710 align:start position:0%
new york virginia new mexico and
connecticut

02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are now 36 states that have
 
02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
medicinal use like the state of new
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire does
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
what this says is our society and our
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
culture has embraced adult legal
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis as an option instead of alcohol
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
for social enjoyment or as pain relief
 
02:58:30.550 --> 02:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioids more importantly
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
the most talked about 2018 unh
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
survey stated that roughly 70 percent of
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents support
 
02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
then we should act on what the people of
 
02:58:44.230 --> 02:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire want
 
02:58:46.230 --> 02:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
the economic impact of a home grow
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
industry that would be included in this
 
02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:49.590 align:start position:0%
industry that would be included in this
bill

02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
is substantial
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
right now roughly 1500 is what someone
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
spends average in america to build a
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
home grow operation
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
if you said roughly one third of that
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
seventy percent of new hampshire
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
residents decided to do them grow
 
02:59:09.670 --> 02:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
if that's applied then it's a minimum of
 
02:59:11.190 --> 02:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
four to five million dollars of new
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
revenue in the state from
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
they would be patronizing hardware
 
02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:33.349 align:start position:0%
they would be patronizing hardware
stores

02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:59:35.830 --> 02:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
lighting companies nurseries contractors
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
electricians who would all then profit
 
02:59:38.479 --> 02:59:39.269 align:start position:0%
electricians who would all then profit
from

02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
the homegrow side of legalization and
 
02:59:41.359 --> 02:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
the homegrow side of legalization and
homegrown

02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
homegrown
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
as well this bill has broad legislative
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
support from the house legislators who
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen bills pass who have been
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about pro-cannabis on both
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
and there
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
has always are willing to confer and
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
work together to try and bring a
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
consensus bill on legalization and
 
03:00:01.359 --> 03:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
consensus bill on legalization and
homegrown

03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
homegrown
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
moreover new hampshire has learned the
 
03:00:07.510 --> 03:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
best practices and the worst practices
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
from other new england states regarding
 
03:00:09.359 --> 03:00:10.469 align:start position:0%
from other new england states regarding
legalization

03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
and it knows how to move forward with
 
03:00:14.230 --> 03:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
logical and sustainable legalized
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis for new hampshire residents
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
we are smart legislators who know how to
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
envision the future for our state
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the future for new hampshire is
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
legalized possession and homegrow of
 
03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
legalized possession and homegrow of
cannabis

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
03:00:32.870 --> 03:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
now calls lieutenant bill bright new
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
good morning once again um
 
03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i noticed in this
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill that i wanted to point out to the
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee was
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
on line 24 it says cannabis infused
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
products containing no more than 300
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
milligrams of thcc
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
as far as a possession limit
 
03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
while i am aware that in a lab setting
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
that level might be able to be tested
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
but as far as i
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
know there is no way for an officer in
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
the field to be able to test the amount
 
03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
of thc
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
in an infused product
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
so that would be extremely difficult to
 
03:01:22.319 --> 03:01:23.830 align:start position:0%
so that would be extremely difficult to
enforce

03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
to have a limit like that
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
you would either a police officer would
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
be forced to either seize all cannabis
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
infused products
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
and inundate the lab or
 
03:01:40.230 --> 03:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
name is frank knack with the accou of
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we are here in support
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
03:02:28.630 --> 03:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
the arguments that we have in support of
 
03:02:30.230 --> 03:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation are the same we have
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
had for the previous bill so i don't
 
03:02:34.469 --> 03:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
want to repeat what i've already said
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh just to say briefly that the war on
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana in new hampshire is wasting
 
03:02:41.349 --> 03:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars it is enforced the
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
staggering racial bias
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
and the collateral consequences on
 
03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
granite state residents are enormous so
 
03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
we support this thank you for your time
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls the honorable
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee i
 
03:03:41.429 --> 03:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
know it's a time to eat soon so i'll be
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
as brief as i can
 
03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:44.070 align:start position:0%
as brief as i can
um

03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
like i said earlier when we were
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
studying uh legalization and taxation of
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis in new hampshire um we looked
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
at a lot of different things and one of
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
them was home grow and the issue came up
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
what do we do about home grow
 
03:03:58.950 --> 03:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the example was thrown around that
 
03:03:58.960 --> 03:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
and the example was thrown around that
um

03:03:59.910 --> 03:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know we already have home display
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
distillation of beer and wine so you can
 
03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
have up to 200 gallons as most of you
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
probably know of a beer wine of beer
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
wine in your home as long as it's not
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's for personal family use or and
 
03:04:14.550 --> 03:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're not selling it
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and only 100 gallons if you you're
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
the only person brewing it in your
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
household that's a lot of wine and beer
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
to make for home use so
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the numbers have a few plants
 
03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
and to allow an increase in the personal
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
possession of the mountain new hampshire
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
is is not even a big stretch it's the
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
minimum we should be doing at this point
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement of the liquor of
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
home distillation unless someone is
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
selling it there is no one at the liquor
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
commission who goes out and checks to
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
see how much you're home brewing for
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
beer or wine
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
i don't foresee that happening with home
 
03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:48.630 align:start position:0%
i don't foresee that happening with home
grow

03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
grow
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis unless someone sees you know
 
03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
plants on uh from satellite from
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
satellite images or airplanes if there's
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
a large field in someone's yard maybe
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
they'll start investigating but
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
traditional home grow of small amounts
 
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
is not been an issue for alcohol and it
 
03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
certainly i don't believe it will be an
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
issue for for cannabis in new hampshire
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused
 
03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'll be very brief this
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
time for the record matt simon prime
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers and i am
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of this bill which
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
would very simply legalize
 
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis possession and limited
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
cultivation for adults as i said in my
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
previous testimony this has been the
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
first step of adult use legalization in
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
nearly every state that has ended
 
03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition for adults and there's no
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
reason that it shouldn't be the first
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
step in new hampshire
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
the questions associated with how to
 
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
best regulate cannabis production and
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
sales are somewhat complex and
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
maybe the criminal justice and public
 
03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
safety committee isn't the only
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee that should be weighing in on
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
those questions frankly but this bill is
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
it merely answers a very simple question
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
what should be
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
the state response
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the adult use and limited possession
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
of cannabis the vast majority of granite

one

04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
i hope no
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
what mine
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
we were going to do that last year but
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
the edna killed it and said that there's
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:57.040 --> 04:58:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.240 --> 04:58:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
at this time i will be opening the
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr20
 
04:58:28.638 --> 04:58:54.628 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr20
and

04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
the committee now recognizes
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.270 --> 04:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues thank you i'm casey conway
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
state representative from dover
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
representing stratford county district
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
13 here now to introduce
 
04:59:12.638 --> 04:59:15.270 align:start position:0%
13 here now to introduce
cacr20

04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
cacr20
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the prime sponsor who is
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
in light of the overwhelming public
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
support for legalizing cannabis
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
many granite staters have asked why
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
can't we just vote on this like they do
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
in other states although new hampshire
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
does not have a process where
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
voters can take matters into their own
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
hands like a referendum much like our
 
04:59:39.910 --> 04:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the east in maine
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
we do have a constitutional amendment
 
04:59:41.600 --> 04:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
we do have a constitutional amendment
process

04:59:43.030 --> 04:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
this is a unique case and i think it
 
04:59:44.878 --> 04:59:45.670 align:start position:0%
this is a unique case and i think it
should

04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
we should seriously consider using this
 
04:59:48.320 --> 04:59:49.350 align:start position:0%
we should seriously consider using this
method

04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
method
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
to improve public policy
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
since the legislature and particularly
 
04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
another chamber in this body has
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly failed to act on cannabis
 
04:59:58.320 --> 04:59:59.750 align:start position:0%
repeatedly failed to act on cannabis
legislation

04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:00:02.070 --> 05:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
despite polls showing a super majority
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
of support cacr20 provides legislators
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
with another reasonable option
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
we could send the question to our
 
05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
constituents and give them the
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide the question for
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
themselves in november
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment language is
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
simple it would add a statement to
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
article 2 the natural rights clause
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
establishing quote all adults shall have
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the right to possess cannabis intended
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
for personal consumption just as article
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
2a protects the right to keep and bear
 
05:00:30.480 --> 05:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
2a protects the right to keep and bear
arms

05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
arms
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
article 2b protects the right to live
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
free of government intrusion
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
this proposed article 2c would protect
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
the right of adults to
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me possess cannabis intended for
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
their personal use
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a complex policy issue
 
05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
cacr20 asks a basic question
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
and it deals directly with the
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
relationship between individuals and our
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
state government and i believe it is
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate that we address
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
this fundament fundamental issue via
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
as the committee is well aware um i have
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
tried to i put forward bills to address
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
this via legislation i'm co-sponsoring
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
another measure this year
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
the preferred measure for making policy
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is a unique situation
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
in part because
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
05:01:26.550 --> 05:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
six maybe longer years we have as a
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislature been unable to advance this
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we heard the term earlier it's it's a
 
05:01:34.948 --> 05:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
charade it's one of those things our
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
constituents can't comprehend why we
 
05:01:39.670 --> 05:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
can't get this done
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh and i hope that this year will be the
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
year that we defy that history um
 
05:01:44.878 --> 05:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
year that we defy that history um
so

05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm continuing to support
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
those measures um but it's it's unknown
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
where those bills are going to go we
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
hope that or i hope that they will pass
 
05:01:56.788 --> 05:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
we don't know that where that process
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
will lead but this gives us an
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
alternative approach
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
um i would argue that referring the
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
question to voters in the form of a cacr
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
not only is a reasonable option
 
05:02:08.708 --> 05:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's the least we can do it's putting
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
the ball in their court and it's letting
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
us listen to them
 
05:02:12.878 --> 05:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
us listen to them
so

05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's much more in these
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks that i will i will hold
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
for later but um but that's the main
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
point here
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
and one thing i want to clarify is that
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
cacr does not
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly mention home cultivation but
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't limit the form of
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
possession that would be contemplated
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
you could argue that it would include
 
05:02:35.360 --> 05:02:37.830 align:start position:0%
you could argue that it would include
cultivation

05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
cultivation
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
but one could amend this to uh clarify
 
05:02:42.550 --> 05:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
that on either side so with that i'm
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:02:45.270 --> 05:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the committee to
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i have a question if if you can
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
a cacr i believe requires a super
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
majority in both the house
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
the senate and the public
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection as well thank you
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:12.798 --> 05:03:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
why article two you know why not have a
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
special article that would add to that
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know why
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
put this on article two
 
05:03:26.958 --> 05:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
put this on article two
well

05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
it could go uh it could go either way
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
the reality is these are uh i think it's
 
05:03:33.440 --> 05:03:36.788 align:start position:0%
the reality is these are uh i think it's
it's

05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
identifying a right that is significant
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire residents and those
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
other rights i believe are equally
 
05:03:42.878 --> 05:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
other rights i believe are equally
significant

05:03:47.430 --> 05:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your you know mr chairman
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
for allowing me a follow-up
 
05:03:50.638 --> 05:03:53.350 align:start position:0%
for allowing me a follow-up
um

05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
i remember seeing the roll call last
 
05:03:56.000 --> 05:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
i remember seeing the roll call last
year

05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with you about
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
letting the voters decide this
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
but there was a second amendment
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh cacr last year and
 
05:04:09.280 --> 05:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh cacr last year and
you

05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
didn't allow the voters to vote on that
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that i could um
 
05:04:15.920 --> 05:04:16.788 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that i could um
again

05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%

05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
not my original proposal but i've
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
thought long and hard about that
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
including last year and i'm i'm here now
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
telling you that that was an incorrect
 
05:04:24.080 --> 05:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
telling you that that was an incorrect
decision

05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh on me representative of course
 
05:04:28.240 --> 05:04:32.948 align:start position:0%
uh on me representative of course
but

05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know what they think on every
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
issue and i would love to know um
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
this question that question and other
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions i wish we had a referendum
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
system in our state we don't but
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
anything that we can get direct um
 
05:04:48.550 --> 05:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
input from our voters i think
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
is appropriate even on things i don't
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions i thank
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%

05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls the honorable
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee oh
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
um my name is joe hannon i'm here
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire harm
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
reduction coalition today
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
and we support this this cac people in
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
this to happen and i think it's it's
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon us to at least even
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't support the idea to give
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
the people the chance to vote on it and
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
let them decide that's what a true
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative democracy is about and i
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
think our republicans better for it if
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
we let the people tell us what they want
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
so i beg you please uh let this pass and
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%

05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%

05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy which is an
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy advocacy group uh here in new
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
i have
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
a lot to say about all these bills so
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'll just sort of condense it into this
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
one speech and won't go on too long so
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't worry about that
 
05:06:44.550 --> 05:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
but we've all heard the arguments about
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana cannabis whatever you want to
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
call it
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
i feel like we all have someone in our
 
05:06:50.160 --> 05:06:51.190 align:start position:0%
i feel like we all have someone in our
lives

05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
who uses marijuana in one form or
 
05:06:53.040 --> 05:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
who uses marijuana in one form or
another

05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
meth it's not cocaine
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're still here today in
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
2021 in a state
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
that proclaims liberty and freedom live
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
free or die
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
debating whether or not someone can grow
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
a plant
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
smoke it on their own use i think is a
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
bit silly
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm someone who supports freedom when it
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
comes to all things i think you should
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
have the liberty to do what you choose
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't infringe on someone else
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
and giving this to the people this
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and other legislation which
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
will legalize it and so on and so forth
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this does
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
we have liquor stores
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
i could give you science if any of you
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
want science on the fact that alcohol is
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
far more dangerous than marijuana
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
causes more deaths causes more crime
 
05:07:46.708 --> 05:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
causes domestic violence
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
far higher rates uh than marijuana does
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're again that we're
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
still here debating this in 2021 uh says
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
a lot about our legislature and
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
specific to this bill the constitutional
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
amendment giving it to the people i
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
think would restore some semblance of
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
faith uh in the institutions of our
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
republic i think you know if you look
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
talk to anyone who's not active in
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
politics nowadays i think you would hear
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
i don't really think that anything's
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
getting done for me up there or in in
 
05:08:20.550 --> 05:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
washington i don't think they work for
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
me i don't really think there is a
 
05:08:23.670 --> 05:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
government anymore that's that's the
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
conversation a lot of people are having
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
we give the people the decision
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
if we give people opportunity to make
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
their own decisions on something like
 
05:08:31.600 --> 05:08:32.390 align:start position:0%
their own decisions on something like
this

05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think that is how we start to restore
 
05:08:34.240 --> 05:08:35.270 align:start position:0%
i think that is how we start to restore
faith

05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
faith
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
in our institutions
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
so with i don't know didn't have
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything written and i apologize for it
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
being a bit of a ranty but
 
05:08:46.390 --> 05:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that the committee really does
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
consider what freedom actually means in
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
this country and if we're going to have
 
05:08:50.320 --> 05:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
this country and if we're going to have
freedom

05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
we should have actually if we're going
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
to proclaim freedom then we should
 
05:08:55.600 --> 05:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
to proclaim freedom then we should
actually

05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
instill that freedom in our country and
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is a small but significant way to
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
do that so
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
i thank the committee for my time
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
there be no questions i thank the
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
name is frank knack with the aclu of new
 
05:09:38.550 --> 05:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh you've already heard my
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
more in-depth testimony this morning on
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
why i think new hampshire should end its
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
war on marijuana
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
just to add that the majority of
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
republicans independents and democrats
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
support legalization of marijuana in new
 
05:09:50.320 --> 05:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
support legalization of marijuana in new
hampshire

05:09:51.510 --> 05:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
we think it's appropriate that the
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
voters choose
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
or if the legislature chooses one of the
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
other options to fix it in statute
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
either way works for us we think this is
 
05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
smart public policy
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
from a fiscal perspective from a racial
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
disparity perspective from a public
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank the witness
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who hasn't signed
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
up that wishes to speak on a spill
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
there being none i will close the public
 
05:10:25.520 --> 05:10:26.948 align:start position:0%
there being none i will close the public
hearing

05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we will stand in recess for 15
 
05:10:29.520 --> 05:10:46.070 align:start position:0%
and we will stand in recess for 15
minutes

05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think he overestimated how much time
 
05:10:56.160 --> 05:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
i think he overestimated how much time
again

05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:58.560 --> 05:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.200 --> 05:11:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't know they were taking
 
05:11:31.360 --> 05:11:37.590 align:start position:0%

well yeah because it points to a place
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the constitution that doesn't exist

thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um i am here to
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
testify in favor
 
05:27:29.670 --> 05:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
of cacr
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
34 as soon as i can find it here we go
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
i am here to introduce cacr34 a
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to provide a
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
framework for cannabis legalization in
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
i have a series of points today that i
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
want to make before the committee
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the first and foremost is the point
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
of process
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
please please please
 
05:27:52.070 --> 05:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
do not vote against this when the time
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
comes specifically because it's the
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
wrong process and because it's a cacr
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
and not a normal bill i'll explain why i
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
think a cacr
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
provides the right foundation needed for
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization going forward and
 
05:28:07.270 --> 05:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
for the record yes i think it's
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that this
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
is one of the last and best avenues to
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
legalization that we have
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
in the form of a cacr i think it's more
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that a plant is legal
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
i hope by the end of today i will have
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
met my responsibility to convince you of
 
05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
the merit of the language despite the
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
package that it's coming to you in
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
the language of the cacr says quote the
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
general court of the state shall make no
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
law infringing on the right to you the
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
use sale and cultivation of cannabis
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
for persons over the age of 18.
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
i chose this language specifically to
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
give the legislature implied regulatory
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
authority by setting the bar at quote
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
infringing on the right you may
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
recognize that language from the second
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
amendment i chose that specifically
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm really really going to try to make
 
05:28:57.270 --> 05:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
the following case without sparking a
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
second amendment conversation
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and at the risk of accidentally
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
invoking one i want to use the supreme
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
court's interpretation of that shall not
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
be in fringe language as it currently
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
stands in precedent this is not
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
specifically my opinion one way or
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
another this is the current starry
 
05:29:14.708 --> 05:29:14.718 align:start position:0%

a decision which i believe was decided
 
05:29:19.760 --> 05:29:20.788 align:start position:0%
a decision which i believe was decided
correctly

05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%

05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
the court ruled that weapons in common
 
05:30:14.070 --> 05:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
use like handguns are protected by the
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
second amendment and that dangerous or
 
05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
unusual weapons could still be
 
05:30:17.600 --> 05:30:18.868 align:start position:0%
unusual weapons could still be
prohibited

05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
i use this example specifically
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
not to take a position on heller or the
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
issue that it was debating but to
 
05:30:28.628 --> 05:30:28.638 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee that i believe
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
a reasonable interpretation of the
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
president and starry decisis would
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
require a court to acknowledge the
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislature as having a right of right
 
05:30:37.200 --> 05:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
legislature as having a right of right
in

05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
inherent and embedded limited right of
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
regulation so long as those regulations
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
didn't impede the broader right
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
because of the specific language in the
 
05:30:48.240 --> 05:30:50.470 align:start position:0%
because of the specific language in the
cacr

05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature would have the authority
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
in this instance to prevent you from
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
smoking in a kindergarten class but you
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
would have the right to smoke in your
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
home this kind of legal interpretation
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
was also solidified by starry decisis
 
05:31:04.548 --> 05:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
with the first amendment in u.s versus
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
schneck in the famous can't yell fire in
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
a crowded theater decision and then
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
later narrowed in brandenburg v ohio in
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
that instance you can't legally call in
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
a bond threat but you can make a
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
statement disagreeing with the
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
government just like you would have the
 
05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
right to grow cannabis and possess it
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
but not drive under the influence
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
i think this kind of implicit suggestion
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
of regulation authority is better than a
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
more overt statement
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
because it is in effect limiting the
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulation authority so that the actual
 
05:31:33.190 --> 05:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
right of use sale or cultivation of
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis must be maintained in any
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory action the legislature
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
decides to take
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
i initially referenced the cacr as a
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
good framework and by that i mean this
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
puts the onus on the legislature to
 
05:31:47.830 --> 05:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
craft cannabis policy
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
under the presumption that if it can and
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be legal and used by the public
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
over the age of 18 instead of well okay
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
if we legalize it what does that look
 
05:31:57.120 --> 05:31:57.910 align:start position:0%
if we legalize it what does that look
like

05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
because i believe the latter ends up
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
being inherently more restrictive
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the committee's time
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to give you a dissertation
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
on the popularity of cannabis
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
legalization in the state of new
 
05:32:08.788 --> 05:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire you've heard it a million
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
times this year including just today
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
i won't tell you anything that you
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
haven't heard already i am simply here
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
to explain why i think this contains the
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
best guard rails possible to ensure safe
 
05:32:21.750 --> 05:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
and effective cannabis policy that keeps
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
public safety in mind while also letting
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis users exercise their freedoms
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
and what my constitutional
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the language is folks
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
are allowed to disagree with that i am
 
05:32:32.948 --> 05:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
one of the few lawmakers that comes to
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and says that i admit that i
 
05:32:36.310 --> 05:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't know everything i would ask the
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
committees pass this with an otp motion
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh having just introduced a cacr knowing
 
05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
that there's another one
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
would you to the extent that you can
 
05:33:02.558 --> 05:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
would you to the extent that you can
provide

05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
an explanation on the differences
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
between at the very least the one that
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
was just heard and your cacr
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
with permission from the chair to speak
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
on bills not currently being heard
 
05:33:15.280 --> 05:33:16.070 align:start position:0%
on bills not currently being heard
yeah

05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
um yes i would be happy to um in my
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
testimony i spoke a lot about
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
inherent regulation authority versus
 
05:33:26.788 --> 05:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
overt regulation authority
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
one of the other cacrs
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
that you will
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
be hearing or either heard
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
the last few words in it specifically
 
05:33:34.320 --> 05:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
the last few words in it specifically
say

05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
subject to regulation by the legislature
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
i believe writing those words there
 
05:33:40.160 --> 05:33:41.830 align:start position:0%
i believe writing those words there
specifically

05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
create a wider opportunity for
 
05:33:43.760 --> 05:33:45.510 align:start position:0%
create a wider opportunity for
over-regulation

05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
over-regulation
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
inherent defined regulation authority
 
05:33:49.200 --> 05:33:50.230 align:start position:0%
inherent defined regulation authority
within

05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
within
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
the language that this cacr has
 
05:33:55.030 --> 05:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
espec in the state of new hampshire in
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
the federal one
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
can do a lot with a lot less language so
 
05:34:01.510 --> 05:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
05:34:01.520 --> 05:34:02.548 align:start position:0%
i believe
having

05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:34:02.558 --> 05:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
having
more

05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
overt language there isn't helpful to
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
the project
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
regarding the cacr only having to do
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
with possession
 
05:34:12.240 --> 05:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
with possession
um

05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
you could make an argument that
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
possession goes pretty broad uh if you
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
consume cannabis you are possessing it
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
in your body
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
um but i believe that if you're going to
 
05:34:24.868 --> 05:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
go the cacr route then it is best to be
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
as inclusive as possible
 
05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
while providing the best guardrails so
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
speak negatively on another colleague's
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill i'm happy to
 
05:34:37.750 --> 05:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
answer that the best i can but those are
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:43.830 --> 05:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i have a quick question
 
05:34:43.840 --> 05:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
i i have a quick question
um

05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to the inherent ability to
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
regulate um constitutional amendments
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
as you i'm sure you're aware the the the
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
courts generally use a um
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
a test uh scrutiny test intermediate
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
stricter um
 
05:35:00.320 --> 05:35:01.190 align:start position:0%
stricter um
that

05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
in itself could take years to
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
say the legislature were to pass some
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
type of regulation and it were
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
challenging the court before that could
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
get even heard or ruled one by the other
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
could take years do you think that just
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
leaving abroad like that is is
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
safe enough for the
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
for that period of time until it sorts
 
05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.878 --> 05:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cases do take a while to
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
percolate um
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
and actually this speaks to the
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
difference in language between the cacr
 
05:35:37.590 --> 05:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
and the other one i just brought up
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think a legislature looking at the
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
words shall not be infringed
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
may be less likely to
 
05:35:44.558 --> 05:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
may be less likely to
pass

05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:35:47.670 --> 05:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
any restrictive
 
05:35:47.680 --> 05:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
any restrictive
legislation

05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
versus the words subject to regulation
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
by the legislature um
 
05:35:56.470 --> 05:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
even that you know hesitation and
 
05:35:59.430 --> 05:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
pumping the brakes for example i had a
 
05:35:59.440 --> 05:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
pumping the brakes for example i had a
bill

05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
come up in ways and means this morning
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh regarding uh different tax rates for
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
different size businesses depending on
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
the wages they pay
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
05:36:12.548 --> 05:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
consideration in the committee
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
on the constitutionality of that based
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
on some specific language than the tax
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
statute about
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
not having differentiating taxes i
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
happen to believe that you know because
 
05:36:25.430 --> 05:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax is based on
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
size that that would be constitutional
 
05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
but there were other members of the
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee that disagreed and i don't
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
know the state of the status of that
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill how it's going to come out but i
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you that that initial
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
hesitation was enough to make some
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
members consider
 
05:36:39.840 --> 05:36:40.708 align:start position:0%
members consider
um

05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
not to you know
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
pout on my other bill uh today but uh i
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
to answer your question i think uh
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
having that language in there uh would
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
provide a little hesitation for future
 
05:36:51.040 --> 05:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
provide a little hesitation for future
lawmakers

05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
lawmakers
 
05:36:53.990 --> 05:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
um there are no further questions thank
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls the honorable
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%

time i speak to you today
um

05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%

05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
so my name is joe hannon and i do

cacrs today
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
um earlier i may have mentioned that
 
05:37:26.558 --> 05:37:27.350 align:start position:0%
um earlier i may have mentioned that
um

05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:28.628 --> 05:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
you know there was some discussion about
 
05:37:28.638 --> 05:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
you know there was some discussion about
whether

05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
federal laws would conflict if we
 
05:37:32.160 --> 05:37:33.670 align:start position:0%
federal laws would conflict if we
legalized

05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
legalized
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis in new hampshire
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
most of you know that the 18th amendment
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
was written to prohibit alcohol in the
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
country and it was repealed by the 21st
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in 1933.
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
i still don't know which amendment was
 
05:37:49.270 --> 05:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
passed to prohibit cannabis in the first
 
05:37:49.280 --> 05:37:51.190 align:start position:0%
passed to prohibit cannabis in the first
place

05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i think because it's never really
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
been done that's just been assumed power
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
the federal government has taken and the
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
states have just kind of gone along with
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the first time it's happened in
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
history it's happened with many other
 
05:38:04.150 --> 05:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
things we have
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
medical we've had a medical program in
 
05:38:07.990 --> 05:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
this state for for several years now in
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
contradiction to federal law
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it did pass it's been operating it's
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
been doing well
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh we also historically have been a
 
05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
state who has gone against the federal
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
government for other things we went
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
against the federal government in terms
 
05:38:22.788 --> 05:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
of slavery
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
we fought to not send return
 
05:38:28.708 --> 05:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
caught slaves back to the south we
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do very well in court but we
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
fought them we fought the fight in new
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire for our own rights and i think
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire deserve the
 
05:38:35.120 --> 05:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire deserve the
opportunity

05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%

05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
their own rights and vote on them in
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%

you don't agree with it let the people

decide and

uh thank you chairman and

05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
my name is terry clayton i have a phd in
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
chemistry and i run an analytical and
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
product development lab in guilford
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i was asked to talk a little bit
 
05:39:40.948 --> 05:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
today i do support the bills put before
 
05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
you today
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i have been asked on
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
regular occasion about safety
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
efficacy and quality
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
if a cannabis program were to were to
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
continue forward so i wanted to tell you
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what i am doing and
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
then quite frankly if going forward
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
as cannabis moves forward in new
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire if there's anything i can do
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
to help people understand
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
from a technical standpoint i would be
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
happy to do so
 
05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
so my laboratory i am
 
05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
licensed by the dea to have controlled
 
05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
substances on site and perform
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
analytical testing i am in process right
 
05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
now to get
 
05:40:22.948 --> 05:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
certified to assist in the tcp program
 
05:40:22.958 --> 05:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
certified to assist in the tcp program
to

05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
help quantify
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
the cannabis that's provided by the
 
05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that i've heard
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
from people is that
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
that today because there is not a
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis program in new
 
05:40:38.240 --> 05:40:39.350 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis program in new
hampshire

05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
typically someone that wants cannabis is
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably through their network
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
probably in a ziploc bag
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's based on trust
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
potency is unknown
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
safety is unknown heavy metals
 
05:40:54.868 --> 05:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
pesticides things like that
 
05:40:57.510 --> 05:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
in it so i think the medical dispensary
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
program is doing quite well
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
there are lots of
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
instruments used regularly in the
 
05:41:10.948 --> 05:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry that are ready
 
05:41:12.868 --> 05:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
methods all set to go
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire were to continue moving
 
05:41:16.470 --> 05:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and my lab as well as
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
other labs that i'm sure
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
would come along with the process
 
05:41:26.070 --> 05:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
can certainly ensure
 
05:41:26.080 --> 05:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
can certainly ensure
potency

05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
potency
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
presence or lack thereof heavy metals
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
so anyways i wanted to share that with
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
this group and if there were any
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions at this time i'd be happy to
 
05:41:40.470 --> 05:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
take them
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%

thank you i do have a question actually
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
given your expertise
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
are you aware of or have you heard of
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
any type of
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
testing that would be forthcoming that
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
would assist law enforcement in
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
conducting an on
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
on the roadside type of test for the
 
05:42:08.390 --> 05:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
presence and level of cannabis in a
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
person's system
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh let's see so in in the person's
 
05:42:14.868 --> 05:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
in the person's body
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
no i think there is some work being done
 
05:42:20.470 --> 05:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are very low-cost kits
 
05:42:24.230 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
available it's called tlc where if um
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
if an officer or someone else can pull
 
05:42:27.670 --> 05:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
someone over
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
is nervous about something that's in the
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
car you know you can test things on site
 
05:42:34.390 --> 05:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm not i'm not aware of a
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer or or i should say a
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
non-intrusive type test that you can run
 
05:42:41.190 --> 05:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
on the spot
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%

05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i am andrew prout
 
05:56:22.390 --> 05:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
representing hillsborough county
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
district 37 the towns of hudson and
 
05:56:24.558 --> 05:56:26.070 align:start position:0%
district 37 the towns of hudson and
pelham

05:56:26.070 --> 05:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
pelham
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
this cacr would establish a right to
 
05:56:30.470 --> 05:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
personal non-commercial possession use
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
and cultivation of cannabis
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
but explicitly permit laws seeking to
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
regulate or tax commercial cannabis
 
05:56:37.360 --> 05:56:39.350 align:start position:0%
regulate or tax commercial cannabis
activity

05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
activity
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the calendar for today i
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
suspect you've heard a lot on these
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
topics so far today
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
so i'll try not to be repetitive
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are two reasons this is filed as a
 
05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
cacr instead of a regular bill
 
05:56:54.310 --> 05:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
the first is simple math it takes one
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
less vote in the body on the other side
 
05:56:57.190 --> 05:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the wall
 
05:56:57.200 --> 05:56:58.390 align:start position:0%
of the wall
um

05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're in the different room than i
 
05:57:00.788 --> 05:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to be when i wrote
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
this though
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
the second reason is coming up this fall
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire will vote on
 
05:57:11.910 --> 05:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
whether to call a constitutional
 
05:57:11.920 --> 05:57:14.390 align:start position:0%
whether to call a constitutional
convention

05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
that happens once every 10 years and in
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
the delegates to that convention would
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
be elected from the same districts as
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
the house and there is no equivalent to
 
05:57:26.948 --> 05:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
the senate or the governor in the
 
05:57:26.958 --> 05:57:29.270 align:start position:0%
the senate or the governor in the
process

05:57:29.270 --> 05:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:57:31.430 --> 05:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
given the popularity of legalizing
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis in recent sessions of the house
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and according to polling data in the
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
general public this is also a viable
 
05:57:39.270 --> 05:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
path to accomplishing the goal of
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis via constitutional
 
05:57:41.360 --> 05:57:43.190 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis via constitutional
amendment

05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
if we do not accomplish legalizing
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis in this session year of the
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
general court
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
i would be among those advocating for
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
the public to call such a convention
 
05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
even if this khackar fails to make it
 
05:57:56.070 --> 05:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
fully through the process to be proposed
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
by this legislature the hearings
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
discussion and votes on this khakar will
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
inform inform the voters and future
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
convention delegates as well
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh i promise to be brief so i'll leave
 
05:58:08.310 --> 05:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
it at that but would of course be happy
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:17.350 --> 05:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
there be no questions the witnesses
 
05:58:28.150 --> 05:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
there being no further witnesses
 
05:58:30.638 --> 05:58:31.590 align:start position:0%
there being no further witnesses
um

05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
we will go ahead and adjourn the hearing
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'll close the hearing excuse me on cacr
 
05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
35 and the committee will stand in
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.320 --> 05:59:18.868 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:21.990 --> 05:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.070 --> 05:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.590 --> 06:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.600 --> 06:00:45.270 align:start position:0%
