start off by looking at the side by side
 
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:27.950 align:start position:0%
start off by looking at the side by side
oh

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay good morning everybody here uh
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go ahead with this
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay the uh we have two bills on
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the docket for this morning to discuss
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh in the work session uh both Senate
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
bills Senate Bill 378 which is relative
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
to the per performance-based School
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
accountability system system task force
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
and S SP 526 it deals with school
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
facility condition assessment and school
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
building grants for temperature control
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to start out with uh 378 and
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
I believe the committee members were
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
handed out a side by side on that that
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
was prepared by our staff upstairs and
 
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
Jen is here in the room if does
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
everybody have a side by side you're all
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
good with that yes
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll be starting up because
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
that takes the the current law and then
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side it goes down with
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
what's been proposed in the in the
 
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.589 align:start position:0%
what's been proposed in the in the
Senate

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill Jen I do not have any extra copies
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
of are there copies that back there on
 
00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
of are there copies that back there on
the

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
table okay we may need a couple up here
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay now this is a work session uh of of
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
our group right here um from the
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
Department it looks like we do have a
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department here
 
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.670 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department here
welcome

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn I saw your other two walk in
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
here a second ago and they disappeared
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
they were going back to doe but um let's
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
let's start right off with the side by
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
side and this is a bill that's looking
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
at the uh performance-based Yak up
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn School accountability system
 
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.150 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn School accountability system
task

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
task
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
force and what we can do is just walk
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
down through that law with the first
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral there on the side by side
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
which speaks to at least every four
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
years the commissioner shall review the
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations for future
 
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
legislation to the legislative oversight
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
commission committee that's in law
 
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.710 align:start position:0%
commission committee that's in law
that's

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
now now that process is being being
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
overhauled do you want to speak to it
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn in a little bit or do you want
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
us just to charge ahead sure um sure I
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
can talk to you talk about so the bill
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
that you guys have in front of you is
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
not intended to um not intended to
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
replace the existing law right now so we
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
have the existing laws in place this is
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
not a repal in place or anything like
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
that what we're trying to do is say that
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
we need continuous Improvement of the
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
existing law of RSA 193e and and the
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
pbass which is I want to remind
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
everybody pbass performance-based
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
accountability system is one of two
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
measurements that are supposed to ensure
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
that schools are providing an adequate
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
education and so there used to be a task
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
force in law that that looked at that um
 
00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
the pbass measurement and refined that
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
and okay can you hold on just right one
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
second right there kitlin turn to page
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
570 in your statutory books
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
here and when you get there that's
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
section 193 e3-
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
C 570 is dealing with the
 
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
C 570 is dealing with the
performance-based

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
performance-based
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and what Caitlyn's talking about right
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
now is what we changed in law four years
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
ago and if you look at the bottom of the
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
page 570 on the left hand column you can
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
see the historical and statutory notes
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
in fine
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
print if you go down to Roman 1 about
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
four lines down you can see where we had
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
it one point we replaced it said the
 
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner May establish a task force
 
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
to assist with this review so we've had
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
before and it said
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
now actually I'm talking about further
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
and you have the new one no this is 2016
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
2017 do you care to have a blue one to
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
look at I I don't would you like one I
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
got that would be helpful but um the
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
point that I'm trying to make is is this
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
is an old task force that used to be in
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
law said there is there is hereby
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
established a taskforce to develop the
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
and so that's really what we're trying
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
to bring back is a super old task force
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
to kind of continuously work on that not
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
not the Commissioners May task force
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
can you repeat that one more time please
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes so the old the old bill so it says
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established a task force
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
to develop a performance-based
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
accountability system that beginning in
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
201122 school year will serve as one
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
method the school use to demonstrate by
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year that is
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
providing an opportunity for an adequate
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
education the commissioner shall be the
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
chairman of the task force and shall
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
appoint no fewer than nine but no more
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
than 13 members to the task force
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
consistent of Department Personnel one
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
or more representative educational
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
experts parents Guardians blah blah blah
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
blah so that's the old task force that
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
the department is that was back in the
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
days when Heather Gage correct and we
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
were changing from No Child Left Behind
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
to so those are separate task force so
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the federal
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
accountability task force which is the S
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
task force this is a performance-based
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
accountability system for the adequate
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
education at that time we also made
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
these changes right here um from what
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
you were reading yes that is true Mr
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
chair yes uh I'm I'm lost does this task
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
force still exist and if so no the task
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
force has gone out of business but
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to the task force that
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
used to be in business we're trying to
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
bring it back that's the purpose of this
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill is to bring that task force you're
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
referencing language in the statute that
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
appears on page 570 I'm trying to
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
understand how this relates to the
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
contention that the task force should be
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
brought back can you help me understand
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on with respect to the
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
request for the task force to be
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
re constituted and the language the
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner May establish a task force
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that what you're you're saying this
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
now becomes permissive under this
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
statute yeah as we get into our
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
discussion you're going to find out
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
what how this the the purpose for the
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
task force what they're going to do in
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
terms of looking some of the indicators
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at and determining
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether we are fiding uh the the the
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
assessment or the based accountability
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
systems working or not so do I
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
understand that the task force that is
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
referenced here on page 570 does not
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
currently exist that it was removed in
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
2020 it was removed in 2020 four years
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
ago okay so the task
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
force that the that you're
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
referencing um went out of business this
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
task force is out of business and we're
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
talking about reestablishing a task
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
force yes but there's
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
different the task force doesn't have to
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
respond back and get approval from the
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee as this
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
is written so it's taking that committee
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
out of the business I know it talks
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
about recommend but it doesn't say
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
approve that's the big difference so the
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
challenge is is that the depart the
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
existing pbass is in law the department
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
the task force anybody doesn't have the
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
ability to change the law without the
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
authority of the legislature as much as
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
we would enjoy that power um so that's
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
why the department would recommend
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
something to the legislature and the
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
legis legislature can then design a bill
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
or they can say no we don't like it
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
you're stuck with the existing law but
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have that ability outside of
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the law right now that that's why this
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
task force doesn't say it will the
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
legislature will do something because
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
you already have the we don't need to
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
tell you that you can make laws you are
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay let's wait on down through because
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have further discussion that on
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
page four of the side by
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
side where you do change the the
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh the report coming back and being
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the Legislative oversight
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
committee that I don't have side by side
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
so okay um I think went to get that we
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
went to get them represent cascaden
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
is it a good time to just ask a question
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
I mean because I I knew of this task
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
force before and annually the
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner is supposed to report out
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
right a summary of this accountability
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
system and everything is
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
shall and then it says the department
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
shall annually prepare that detail
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
report and then in the historical where
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
it does reference you just read it the
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
task force everything was
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
referencing the commissioner design
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
shall be the chairman of that task force
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
so what I'm I'm questioning now it's the
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
task force is not in the law currently
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
right was removed now that's only dated
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
2020 and I guess I ask why was a task
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
force removed from the law was it
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
replaced with the legislative oversight
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
committee or not or did they go hand in
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
hand but why are we going back to
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
something we had before that I'm
 
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.590 align:start position:0%
something we had before that I'm
guessing

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.470 align:start position:0%
guessing
worked

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
um so and it makes sense but I'm just
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
questioning well why did it get thrown
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
out and we're sitting here talking about
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
who's going to be on a task force
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
but so I think yes I think we have a
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
couple different things so we we got to
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
remember there's essentially two
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
parallel but not the same accountability
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
systems in theory in this state y excuse
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
me Jen can you make sure that Caitlyn
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
she yeah she just
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
gave um so we have the need for an
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
accountability for an adequate for an
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education so
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
that is State accountability um that um
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the past schools used to be able to
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
prove that they are providing an
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education through the ibas
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
system the input based accountability
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
system or the performance-based
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
accountability system the department
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
used to um run those kind of comparisons
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
run the ibass I'm sure you filled it out
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
many times um and then if a school did
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
not provide inadequate or could not pro
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
as providing adequate education through
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
the ibass system then we reviewed the
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
pbass system right okay so that was the
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
past and that is still kind of the
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
system except that in maybe 2020 I think
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
it was this committee and the full
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
legislature changed the or to an and so
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
now School schools must prove that
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're providing an adequate education
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
through ibass and through pbass so that
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
was a big major change um at that same
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
time I think that's when the the task
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
force was taken out the department also
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
was supportive and I was part of that
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
supportive was um trying to tie the
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
state accountability system for an
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
adequate education to the federal
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
accountability system Divine designed in
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the every student succeeds act um now
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
since we have started trying to
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
implement some of that we have found
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
that there are some challenges and we
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
really think that we need to look at the
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for inadequate education and
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the system that defines that and then
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
the other parallel accountability system
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
is the federal accountability system
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
that the state is required to implement
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
as part of the every student succeeds
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
act and so we're doing that with um
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
using all of our federal funds that we
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
received that we do that and we are
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
required to determine schools that are
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
Title One schools that are the bottom 5%
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
of schools and then we're supposed to
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
determine them as um CSI comprehensive
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
support and Improvement schools and then
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
provide them additional resources so
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we do under the federal law
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
the additional resources comes from the
 
00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:16.750 align:start position:0%
the additional resources comes from the
federal

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
funding on the state side of things um
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
we started kind of going in that
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
direction because we said all right it's
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
the same assessment and we do want to
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are leveraging exist
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
processes as much as possible um when
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing this work because one we
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't have tons of extra resources to do
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
two two parallel um accountability
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
systems it's confusing why there would
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
be multiple accountability systems but
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time the opportunity for an
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education is not what is in the
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds act they're very
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
different um very different legislation
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation versus State
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislation around inadequate education
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
and so um a year ago when Nate and I
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
were here in front of you all we were
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
trying to say we need some flexibility
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
to kind of help better Define the state
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
accountability for an adequate education
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
um and then we want to leave the federal
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
side over here knowing that we're still
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
using one test we're still collecting
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
the same data as the same kids but
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's obviously just from discussions
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
with people in this room the legislature
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
and his a whole other people around with
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
like lawsuits and whatnot the the
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
accountability for an adequate education
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
is different and there are different
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
measurements and indicators that we
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
should probably be looking at rather
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
than outside the federal so that's
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
really what we're trying to do is we're
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of so back in 2020 and I
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
think we really starting I I think 2018
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
because that's why I had to grab the
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
2016 2017 law book we kind of co-mingled
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of that and we're trying now to
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
kind of pull some of that apart not all
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
of it but pull as much of it as far as
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
possible so we can have these two
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
parallel systems so we can really ensure
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
that we are comp with both the state's
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
expectations and the federal
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
expectations so can I represent
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
T thank you and I guess I want to pursue
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
what I kind of was talking about
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday that in 2017 we got rid of
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
pace the performance assessment the
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
national uh Pace Competency Based
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
education um and I'm wondering did it
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
just totally collapse I mean did did we
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
not have a way to measure during that
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
time did we not have a structure in the
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
state department and and now we're
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
trying to reconstitute something so Pace
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
was never about the accountability for
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
an adequate education it was Al it was
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
um assess it was Competency Based
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
assessments and it was different
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
assessment methodologies but it it never
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
replaced the task force it never
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
replaced accountability or anything like
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
that so Pace was an entirely separate
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
and it was a pilot um it was determined
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education in
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
consultation with the US Department of
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
Education that it was something that we
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
could not no longer go forward with
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
mostly because it wasn't something that
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
was scalable um and so the US Department
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
of Education didn't approve um continu
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
waivers for the pace project um because
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
it was a pilot project it was saying
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
like let's see if we can TR change the
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
way that we are assessing kids and um it
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
was something that was um that we tried
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and we just decided we could not no
 
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
longer continue forward with but that
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
completely outside of accountability it
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
was never meant to Place accountability
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no talk of pace
 
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.470 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no talk of pace
in

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
accountability so let's try to get back
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
right to the the the uh side by side
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
move through it the first line in Roman
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
one says in current law the commissioner
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
shall review the performance-based
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
system fine then you go across to the
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
other side where it says there is hereby
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
established a task force to develop to
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
develop and review whereas before if you
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
looked at what I pointed out to at the
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
bottom page
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
570 the commissioner May establish task
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
force to assist with this review it
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
develop so what the department seems to
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
be doing here is handing off the
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
development which is the responsibility
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
of the department right now to a task
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
force so and the reason for that is
 
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
because we tried to do it last year and
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that this the committee
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
specific Ally in this room was not
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of the department doing that
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
on its own and so we said well I guess
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
we need a task force or we need somebody
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
else but we tried to change a lot of
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
that with 266 last year and we could not
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
go forward with it um there was there
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
was just a lot of technical concerns
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
that were brought up here and the
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
department was trying to listen to the
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
concerns discussed in this room um and
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know the conversation in this room
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
was about well what about this thing
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
what about this thing all you know
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
adding these additional indicators like
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right clearly the conversation needs
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be much bigger than just Nate green
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
and I trying to make an accountability
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
system where the math can math CU that's
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
really what we were trying to do last
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
year there's so much confusion and like
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
the terminology is so co-mingled and
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
different parts of the law are
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
co-mingled into here and it's as we're
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
trying to implement it which we've been
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
trying to do essentially for the last
 
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
two years for the very first time we
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
have really really struggled with that
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
because the law has just been taken and
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
written over over and over again and
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
different parts left in and different
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
parts removed that we really felt needed
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
to be there um
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
that I mean truly the RSA 193 c e and H
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
need to be completely overhauled
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
completely Rewritten um and we need to
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are keeping in mind
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
the accountability for adquate
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
Education the assessment requirements
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
that are State assessment requirements
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
and the Federal feral accountability
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for that every student
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
succeeds Act and the federal assessment
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and these are all kind of
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
these different buckets that um are very
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
important that everybody has a lot of
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
opinions on that are just getting a
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
little bit messy over times I mean we
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
spent an absorbant amount of time
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the student identifiers
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
last time which or the sorry the slds
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
system like the whole state system for
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
sassin numbers that's randomly
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
co-mingled in here it doesn't need to be
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
having assassin number has nothing to do
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
with inadequate education it's a very
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
important section of the law that the
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
department uses for a whole Myriad of
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
things but we really need to kind of
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
pull that out and that being in here
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
confuses everybody and so when a
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent or a principal comes to
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
us and says can you show us exactly how
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
in law we're supposed to be implementing
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
an adequate education we like oh well
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
here and it talks about the minimum
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
standards for an adequate education but
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the full minimum standards
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
section that's in the 306s that's the
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for Public School
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
approval there is so much confusion
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
fix yes represent vure thank you Mr
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
chair just a a question on U timing do
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
we do we have time to do a little bit of
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
amending to this or do we need to act on
 
00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.389 align:start position:0%
amending to this or do we need to act on
this

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
immediately uh this bill is not an early
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
bill of the Senate bills we have we have
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
several of those and those have to be
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
out of committee by the 25th of this
 
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.909 align:start position:0%
out of committee by the 25th of this
month

00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
these bills right here have to be out of
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
the here around the 14 well yeah I'm
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to say the 14th the 16th is that
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and or and we've always been
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
told get it out earlier so it' be about
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
the 14th of May this would have to come
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
out be acted
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
upon so so going down and following
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
where where we are with this in Roman
 
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.510 align:start position:0%
where where we are with this in Roman
one

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
here there if you were to look at the
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
section I pointed to in the bottom page
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
also says of this task force the
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall be chair who's going
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
to be chair of this task force it
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't state in
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
378 um the task force would would
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
appoint a chair it doesn't say that so
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
we can it does so that would have to be
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's done to this so that
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
it maybe uh maybe the commissioner
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
appoints or maybe it's the commissioner
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
or maybe the you know the commissioner
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
opens up and then that body chooses
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
their chair the commissioner certainly
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the capacity to do this
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
level of work um this task force to
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
really come up with a true
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
accountability system would need to meet
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
quite a few times for probably several
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
like for dayong meetings the
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner so the commissioner
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a chair and that's why
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
because the original task force too from
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
2016 had the commissioner as being shair
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
and we Nate and I specifically said
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's not something that commissioner
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
has the capacity to do so okay are there
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
any now we we were're on page one of
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
this side by side we were looking at
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
Roman one and we slipped into a starting
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
look at Roman two I wasn't going down
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
through the membership on that
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
particular task
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
force um but I was talking about who
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
chairs it and I know the previous laws
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
have always said that the commissioner
 
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
have always said that the commissioner
shall

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
chair or designate yes
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
correct are there any questions of
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn on one and two yes uh yeah the
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the question I have I
 
00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:40.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the question I have I
don't

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
see unless I'm misreading this I don't
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
see any
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
teacher as appointed as a potential
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
member of this task force is there a
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
reason why a teacher was not I know
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
you've got other certified Personnel in
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
there but it's as you as you went
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
through the Litany of uh options here I
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
noted that there was there was not a a
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
practicing teacher that was involved in
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
this uh list here I just was there a
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
reason for that um I mean so teacher
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
could certainly fall under the category
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
of educational experts um so you could
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
certainly put a teacher in there but we
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
kind of felt that through principles and
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
superintendant that they would have the
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate teaching experience um
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to kind of cover that area too
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
if the committee felt a teacher should
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
be added we'd be fine with that too
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so are you going to be looking
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the Integrity um accuracy the
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
validity of such an instrument or
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the test and
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
measurement issues which we certainly
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
would be wanting to look at
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
reliability all that um Range variances
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the majority of that those kind of
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions are really handled on the
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
assessment side of things and there are
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's assessment there's called the
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
Tac it's the I don't even know what the
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
TAC stands for I should um but it's
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
essentially assessment task force that
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
looks at reliability and validity of of
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
Assessments um and so a lot of that is
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
handled over there on that side of
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
things there's no reason why this task
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
force couldn't but this is really about
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
designing what the indicators are that
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
the department is reviewing to determine
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
if a school is providing an adequate
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
education or not but you already put the
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
indicators in there so it says this say
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of the ones that we should look at
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
but it's I mean this these are the ones
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
most of these are current law right so
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
we said it looks like a Cherry Picked a
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
few okay um maybe um but so I think
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
these are some of the indicators that
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
are in current law that we said we
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
should look at but we should also look
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
at other metrics as determined by the
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
task force and we two weeks ago when we
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
sat here we had you had um I think some
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
people brought up CTE somebody else
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
brought something else up and like these
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
are exactly what we're saying is clearly
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that think there
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
are things that should be part of the
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
measurement that are not currently part
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
of the measurement and we need to to
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
determine that yesterday we spent I I'm
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
sorry for you taking all the time we
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
looked at instruction curriculum and
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
assessment and trying to ensure all
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
three are
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
aligned and in assessment assessment is
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
really an issue a topic that somebody
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
just can't come off the street and say
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
well this is what we're going to have uh
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of mechanics to it and and
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about dealing with test
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
and measurement stuff uh I would hope
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
that anything we're doing that all these
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
folks have a good understanding of
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
curriculum a good understanding of
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
instruction and especially when we're
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
talking accountability a good
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
measurement I agree yeah okay
 
00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:52.029 align:start position:0%
measurement I agree yeah okay
representative

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
you very much M Davis so I I may have
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
missed this um uh earlier uh cuz I I I
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
stepped in a few minutes after you began
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to your test amounting but um in
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
the uh in the current section of
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
e3c what um
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
what types of schools does that current
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
the the basically the the pbass what
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
what schools or what organizations does
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
that apply to now public schools public
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
schools sorry uh Public District Schools
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
it does not apply to Charter Schools so
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
P say that again Public District
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
Schools district Public School school
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
district yes public school districts
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
okay so would it would it be fair then
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
to say that since it only applies to
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
public school districts that that the uh
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
the the members of the commission I'm
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
sorry of the task force that are that
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
are listed out in in um Roman 2A
 
00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
are listed out in in um Roman 2A

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
C A and
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
C um would would also be current
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
employees of a public school district
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and I would also add onto that what
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative Myer asked that perhaps
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh a a a a teacher holding a current
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
certification and currently employed at
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
a public school district um that that we
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
put those qualifiers on on um on the
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
members of the feels like they want to
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
add that that's fine I I mean I think
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
the old one I think might have had a
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I think just talking about
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about including
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
some of the associations and things like
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
that those people are not employees of
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
school district so if the committee
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
wants to limit that I think that's
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine but right I'm just saying
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
cons consistent with your your your
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
statement that that PE only applies to
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
public school districts it does not
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
apply to Charter Schools doesn't apply
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
to private schools doesn't apply to efas
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
to those are
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
public those those are public school
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
that would apply yes that would apply to
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
C them but but there but there are C
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
Charters but there are certain things no
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to Charters I I
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
understand I can show you that where
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
phraseology is but I'm also looking at
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom page 570 where we've had this
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
task force in place before and I can't
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
understand why if we're going to have a
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
committee like that we don't have
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
educational experts on there uh why we
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a parent on there who's
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
not an employee I I only was talking
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
about AB andc I'm not oh oh okay yeah
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
the where you where you go to oh you're
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
only talking A and C A and C which
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
talked about uh people with with
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
credentialed um um people that that are
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
that are serving in that capacity and
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
Public School District I would just say
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
a Schoolboard member is not probably
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
considered employed no but but serving
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
serving of a in a public school I mean I
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want a Schoolboard member while
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're on they're on the school board
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
of a private school um that's you know
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay so yeah and by are saying that's
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
really we metant a public school board
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
member we didn't need a yeah yeah I I
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
mean but I just want to be real this is
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
echoing exactly what was in the law
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
before and and the department okay good
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
what what the the have you opened up
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
your got it open right here 570 yeah
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
bottom left hand
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
column where it says under the under
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
Roman one it says 13 members to the task
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
force which shall consist of and then
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
you you read them all
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's but but that was also that was TW
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
was that 2020 yes yeah um I I just think
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
you know having being very specific
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
about you know the the credentials that
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
they hold and where they're so and and
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
put the certification in there require
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically requiring it I I I would just
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of time this might
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
actually take I think there's some
 
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
really quality retired superintendent
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
and principles that are maybe not
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
employed that we would maybe want to
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
cautious on that okay no and I and I was
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
sort of I had that in the back of my
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
mind I also have have in the back of my
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
mind um you know a teacher that that may
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
teach in a private school in another
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
state that also happens to hold a a
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
teaching credential in New Hampshire or
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know or something I'm I'm not sure
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
if how do I
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
say that that that having um having
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
either being currently employed by a
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
public school or having served as an
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
employee in a public school in these
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
capacities I think is is a is is
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
relevant experience I agree with that
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes and that's really what the
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
department was trying to get with that
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
putting making requiring it to be a a
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
credential holder but it but that I
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
think probably what you're saying is
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
gets in the same direction okay and then
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
and then and and for the this would be a
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
task force so would meet in person at
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education this is not
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
something somebody that lives in like
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
North Carolina could do so yeah no I I
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
um but with zoom these days things yeah
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so the department is actually pretty
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
stringent about its requirements and
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
expectations of these task force members
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
with our accountability task force we're
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
very strict about that we meet in person
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
um we've had a few Zoom meetings but
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're really bringing it back in person
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of value um with these
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
types of conversations when they're had
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
in person well chair lad I just served
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
on a task force and and there were some
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings um you know on that been
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
Park too um the and and and if if I may
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just sort of continuing on
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
where where you've got educational
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
experts parents Guardians I think that's
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
that that there there's there's
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
definitely some good having parents
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
Guardians um in there but where where
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
we've got members of a public interest
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
group concerned with education there's a
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
lot of those in New Hampshire and I know
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
other uh U other legislation that has
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
called for task force in task forces or
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
Commissions in other areas such as um um
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
environmental resources things like that
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
have specifically called out
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
organizations that that have shown
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous commitment to the state of
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like The Nature
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
Conservancy so then just say like an
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
environmental interest group you know
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
they actually specifically call out you
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
know uh the um you know a member
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the the executive director
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
of of TNC uh and I'm wondering if maybe
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
that would apply here too because we
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of um you know very serious
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
groups that come and testify um in this
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee so such as Nea New Hampshire
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
aft New Hampshire ACLU reaching higher
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and that possibly those
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
those groups could um could could have
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
experts contribute to this work so the
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
department specifically kind of put that
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
cash all on so we could have experts so
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
just kind of a couple reminders and
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
because this is something that NE and I
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
went around with like really what is the
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
makeup of the task force and said let's
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
try to tie as much to the old one as
 
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.589 align:start position:0%
try to tie as much to the old one as
possible

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
um one it's the commissioner in
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
consultation with the oversight
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee so I would imagine that we
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
would probably bring a fair number of
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
people as appropriate to the oversight
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee and potentially do the
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
appointments um so we put a cap of 15
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
members so that because we can't have a
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
500 member committee um and then so six
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
of them are automatically going to be
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
made up of superintendents from around
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
the state two of them are going to be
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
principls and one of them is going to be
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
a school board member so that's nine
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
right there so that gives you six to
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of work with um and they could be
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
in that catchall category
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
um we absolutely value the um opinion of
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the educational experts in the
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
state and or work with them very
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
regularly at the department but we
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily want to call out each
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
one individually because one we just
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
accidentally forget somebody but two
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um we want to make sure that we don't
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
have a gigantic task force that we we
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's something that
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
we can actually control and so that's
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
kind of why we're saying we would
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
probably bring a group in consultation
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe say all right this is
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate and maybe we say if all six
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
of them want you know it's the if six of
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
them were um you know all from the
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association we' maybe say
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
all right well we don't want six members
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
of the not nhj even has six people but
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't say maybe we don't want
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
those six people just from that
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
Association because you already have six
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
superintendence or maybe you want to use
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
somebody from some of the other groups
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly kind of what the the
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
discussion the department inv Visions um
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
by you know having this task force and
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
having it it appointed by the
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and in consultation with
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
the governor and this this group so and
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
a quick followup Mr chair on that and
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
when you say in consultation with the
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
governor and the oversight committee
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
what does that mean from a um from a uh
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
from a practical
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint um so the department consults
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
with committees I think on a regular
 
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.390 align:start position:0%
with committees I think on a regular
basis

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be we the department
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
really sees it as a conversation and
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to say like all right this is who
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
we think is the appropriate group if you
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to give it more
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
teeth we could probably do that too um
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
but I also want to make sure
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
that we actually get a task force
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
appointed and move forward with
 
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.550 align:start position:0%
appointed and move forward with
it

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
so further question this represent
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair so this task
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
force if I'm not understanding correctly
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
was in law for a number of years but
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
repealed in
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
2020 why like there must have been some
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
reason and is that reason still valid or
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
has something Chang yeah so that was
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
really an effort of the Department of
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Education to kind of well one there was
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that removed a lot of old
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
task force everything like that so I
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was originally swept
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
up in that bill um I don't know if
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
somebody could look that up um Jen could
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
um but the department did try to make an
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
effort to consolidate a lot of the
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
accountability work especially with the
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
work that we were doing around Essa um
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then we kind of took a look at that
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
and said no these are really separate
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
systems and we really do need to pull
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
them apart and they do need to have
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
separate accountability and there's so
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
much that needs to go on with State
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
accountability and you know part of that
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:41:59.319 --> 00:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
is the
Department's

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
continued learning about the systems and
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rules and how they interact with
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
each other um and and that's partially
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
through changes in laws that's partially
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
from the work the the department has
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
been doing because of the various
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
different funding lawsuits um the
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
various different bills um but so the
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
department was and I don't remember
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
exact details but probably involved with
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the elimination of the original task
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
force and now we're saying we really
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
need to pull them back apart and look at
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
them separately um and and a lot of that
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
too was is so the department when we
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
were trying to consolidate the
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
accountability um in 2017 and 18 the
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
department was trying to do that because
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the Essa work but now that
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have started implementing the Essa
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
work and we under because that was
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
before it was ever implemented but when
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
the department started doing that work
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
the complexity and kind of the metrics
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
around that were like well this is not
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily defining an adequate
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
education this is the accountability for
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
the federal accountability system
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
but the accountability for an adequate
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
education which is defined in RSA 193 E2
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
is different than what we're looking at
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
Nessa and part of that was conversations
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
too and we've had many conversations in
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
this committee what are you doing to
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
support the state schools that are not
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
providing inadequate education the
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
department does not have resources to
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
support those State schools if you
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
happen to be determined a CSI School
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
under the federal accountability system
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
and also not providing inadequate
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
education through either ibass or pbass
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and you get lucky enough to be lucky is
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not the appropriate term but you
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
are failing under both systems you are
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
eligible for a very specific Federal
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
grant but if you are just not providing
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
an adequate education through ibass
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
alone and you're not one of those bottom
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
5% of schools there's nothing there's no
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
additional resources the department can
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
provide to any schools right now and
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a challenge that
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
we've discussed many times because we
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
have say you are automatically exempt
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
from Federal accountability if you're
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
not a title one school or um have a very
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
very low graduation rate but so any
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
non-title one high school that has a
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
graduation rate about a above a certain
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
amount is automatically exempt from that
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
any Elementary School that doesn't
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
receive Title One funds which in a
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
district so Title One is rank ordered by
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
poverty um those schools are
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
automatically exempt from federal
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
accountability but those schools are
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
still or those towns municipalities we
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
as the state of New Hampshire are paying
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
adequate education dollars for those
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
kids so there should be some
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
accountability for those schools as well
 
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.150 align:start position:0%
accountability for those schools as well
represent

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
cascaden um just so I can kind of
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
picture this in my mind and I I Envision
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
that public school approval is the
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
following of the 306 rules correct me if
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong and the performance the
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
accountability that we're talking about
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
is the minimum standards plus the other
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
indicators in that accountability system
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
and then further the Essa accountability
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
plan it really encompasses all the
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
federal dollars and programs yeah is
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
that a fair way to kind of pocket these
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
big um it is and actually it's funny
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
because on the whiteboard in my office
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
there's there's these circles we've
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
talked about specifically that so um we
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a couple different things we have
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
the accountability for an adequate
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
education which is ibass and pbass so
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the inner so there's
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
adequate education funding there's um
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
the accountability for an adequate
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
education which is RSA 193 E2 which is a
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the minimum standards but not
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
all of the minimum standards and so
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that's confusing and
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
the department specifically tried to ter
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
change that terminology last year with
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
this committee we couldn't get there um
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
and so so it's a portion of the minimum
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
standards and then we have the minimum
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
which are a lot more comprehensive than
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
just the the ones find in RSA 193 E2 cuz
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's just a small section and that is
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
everything a public school has to do to
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
be approved and then another bubble over
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
here with a little bit of overlap
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
because the same kids the same
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
assessments the same you know indicators
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
and metrics you have Essa so there's
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
some overlap but there's not it's not
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere does s say that you know you
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
have to look at the minimum standards
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
set forth in 306 42 or whatever follow
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
up yes so then now taking that
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
that those pots I guess for lack of a
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
better word we're focused on the
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability plan
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
correct so is there still in place the
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for schools to submit their
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
action plans is there corrective action
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
are they still labeled CSI and TSI I
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
mean is there technical so assistance R
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
does that part of the plan still exist
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
all under the federal absolutely that
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
just stays there um okay I'm not sure
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one of the things
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's confusing and I think we should
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
probably use better terminology or
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
different terminology is like I guess
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
right now under the law we have state
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
CSI schools and we have Federal CSI
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
schools we should I think the um there
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
should be a different well different
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
different terminology if they're going
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
to have different measurements and I
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
think one of the bills um used the word
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
State underperforming schools and that
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
so maybe we switch to that and then so
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
we have the whole federal system over
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
here we have the whole state system over
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
here and so we can
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
actually then then have the corrective
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
action plans all all of that work the
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
technical assistance under the state
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
side of things separate from the federal
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
side of
 
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559 align:start position:0%
things we've been trying to work towards
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
this for years uh there was always the
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
issue of our high schools many many of
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
the high schools never received a title
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
$1 they they were received maybe within
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
that District For A Grade School uh so
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
then you had one maybe high school or
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
two high schools that are on that in uh
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
report needing support and they were
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
saying wow we have two really you know
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
failing high schools in the state that
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
was not necessarily the case we only had
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
two that were receiving Title One monies
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
that were perceived by the state as
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
being low there were others and so then
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
we went to the direction maybe this
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
accountability system needs to measure
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
all high schools or all schools in the
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
state which it should and that's I think
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
the struggle that we're you we're after
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
right now and that's a great example I
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
mean that that gra that that right there
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
is I mean it's a one of many many issues
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we have but that is a very
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
describable um understandable example
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so look going down through this the
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
we're still in uh Roman 2 there uh and
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
and sliding towards the other ones of
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 but are there any more uh
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions about Roman 1 or two I would
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
here yes
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
representa no represent Damon thank you
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so I have a question going back
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
to representative Luna's
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
topic it on uh Ed the members of a
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
public interest group so is there a
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
definition of what a public interest
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
group Group
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
is because I have reservations about how
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended that
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like can an individual form a
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
public interest group that wants to
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
advocate for
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
some some particular aspect of education
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
and invite themselves to be part of this
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
so I would also think that the
 
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner the governor and the task
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
force would use Prudence when appointing
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
people to this commit
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
and so understanding
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's um backgrounds and expertise
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
and how they're going to be able to
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
dedicate their time and resources to
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
this task force are all things that the
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
department and the group of people doing
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
the appointing will understand um so it
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
I certainly I think anybody's able to
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
apply to be part of this task force but
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
we the legislature the department need
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're appointing the
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
best available
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
people just yesterday we had the
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board we were
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
talking about and we were talking about
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
how Career Technical education wanted to
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
have some folks from the business
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
community on there seeing that they want
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
to have some impact as far as what that
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
outcome's going to be uh I don't see the
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
business Community used to be in the old
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislation for this task force right
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
here but they're not but they would come
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
underneath those other interested groups
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're not you know an
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
association it could be just somebody
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
coming out of you know one of our
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plants here that's has a
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
real strong interest in seeing that we
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
want kids coming out with these skills
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
and how you're going to measure those
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
skills by test or are you going to
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
skill I'll pause yeah yes represent
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner I mean so and I just want to to
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's point I mean if
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
you want to change that terminology we
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy with that we wanted to
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that we felt we had the
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility if we had a really high
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
quality group that came forward to the
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
department that wanted to participation
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
participate on it that we didn't limit
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that and we obviously cannot list every
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
public interest group that exists in the
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
state or we have legislation as long as
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
this book so yeah represent Tanner thank
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
you um I think somebody from
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
representing special education should be
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
on that committee um because of the real
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
specific way that they're going to be
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with assessment um I also feel
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
that um we should have some of the
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
people appointed by different groups for
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
example the school boards Association
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
and then approved by the task force and
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner I I just I want to get
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
away from political appointments as much
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
as possible on this if we're really
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to do it and lastly I totally
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
agree with you that you need at least
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
one or two experts on testing to to be
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
on that committee absolutely yeah
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely and there's there's a lot of
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
groups out there for example we used to
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
have a man that was sitting here all the
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
time years ago his name was Mark
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
Joyce and you know Mark he'd be a super
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
person on on a group like this Dr Joyce
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
and his family were all Educators from
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
Niger Falls area but he came to this
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
state and he was outstanding and he
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
oftentimes wrote Our statutes for us I I
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
worked with the mark for years myself
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I agree and that's partially why we
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to other educational experts
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
because somebody like Mark is not
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
working in a public school he's not
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
working for nhsa right now but we could
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
certainly now he's probably very happy
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
in Florida and not I think not wanting
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be sitting in this room because he
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
did that for many years but but people
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
like that that's exactly why we left it
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
open ended so yeah he and I were born in
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
hospital within the same year at Niger
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
Falls County Hospital that's pretty
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
crazy yeah yeah it's a crazy world rep
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you Mr chair I have a
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
question on item e in the list here it
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
says the department shall advise
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
facilitate and support the task force is
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
this position a non-voting member or
 
00:53:45.549 --> 00:53:45.559 align:start position:0%
just merely an advising member because I
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
would assume that members of the task
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
force are going to have to take some
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps some votes on issues ETC and so
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
the question I have is whether or not
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
the intent uh and E is for them to be a
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
voting member or merely an advise and
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
Technical Support merely advise and
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
Technical Support okay so that I think
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's an issue then should be clarified
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
we should put in parentheses technical
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
support or advising yeah like we do with
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
Jeff beards or what we do with Steve
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
applebe right exactly thank thank you
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
for the clarification thank good point
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
let's go on to item
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
Roman three on the the task force side
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
because is Roman two on the other side
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
that identify performance criteria and
 
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.270 align:start position:0%
that identify performance criteria and
measurements

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
Etc yes so I think I think you mentioned
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
this earlier what about the
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
organizational aspects of the task
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
force as being one of the first duties
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they well I think that's what we
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
have to identify who's going to be the
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
chair and how do you I thought we had
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
that documented as something we have to
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
amend yeah so calling the who's going to
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
call the first meeting then the First
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
Act is to elect a chair yeah unless it's
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
the first name person is the chair or
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
what you know it could be yeah I mean
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
whatever that whole thing we got to
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
resolve that that be done I think easily
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but I think that needs to be in the
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
even though it wasn't in the 2020
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
statute I think um I think that's
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
important um uh also that um that that
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
meetings will be conducted in public
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
duly noticed uh whether there's going to
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
be public comment period um in those
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
meetings you know so the organizational
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
structure is important then something
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
that came up on our school funding
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
commission although the pandemic um it
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
got swept away by uh by the p mic was um
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
whether um non-legislative members I
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
know and there aren't legislative
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
members on that uh would be would
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
receive mileage particularly if they're
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
coming from you know parts of the state
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
that are 100 miles away I noticed the
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
legislative members were not on this
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
right here there are no legisl they were
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
before were wants to be on that no so
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
they were before but the reason we put
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
that out is because we wanted to bring
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
it to the oversight committee and so we
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
really were kind of putting everything
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
back on the power of the oversight
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
committee um and that's that's like
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
oversight committee has the ultimate
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
kind of like where they're bringing this
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
group is bringing the results of that
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why we took them off yeah so
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
I think I think that's a reasonable way
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
to engage the legislative members um on
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
this but but even without legisl even if
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
there's no legislative members on here I
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
think providing some mileage
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
consideration or something like that
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
realistically this is my personal
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
opinion um realistically mileage and
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
potentially siphons would be really
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
helpful but the department didn't want
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
to put something that has a um a fiscal
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
note forward honestly because we wanted
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
to get done we are expecting these
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
people to be educational experts to take
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
time their probably personal time to do
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
this work it would be great if we could
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
pay a nominal stien to
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
to show people we at least appreciate
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
their time and appreciate and and um
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
efforts towards this so but I don't know
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
that that's that's not something the
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
department ever does and so I just want
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of put that out there um didn't
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
well we know the department has Deep
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
Pockets so oh yeah very deep um the the
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the olw or design shall
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
be the chairman that was in Laine so uh
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
we want to really work that out who's
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the chair let's move on down
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
to the this area three here the task
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
force and the following duties
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
um any issues there so we can march on
 
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
um any issues there so we can march on
down

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
further how about Roman 4 the task force
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
system so and um actually and just let
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
me read the the current
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
law and Senate Bill 378 discuss how the
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
PB pbass shall be based on data and
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
indicators current law references data
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
and indicators the indicators that
 
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.870 align:start position:0%
and indicators the indicators that
you're

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
referencing are on page 564
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
the delivery of an adequate education
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's where you I think you've probably
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
lifted number number of these indicators
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
and put in
 
00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:38.750 align:start position:0%
and put in
here

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
the I noticed if you can look on 5 564
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
and 565 you can see those indicators and
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
a number of those indicators sort of are
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
have been integrated
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
in can you speak to that first yeah well
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
so one thing I just just want to point
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
out because representative Bel brought
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
this up last time and we was talking
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
about using only the best available
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
accountability system that is actually a
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
typo we went back and we looked at the
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
original legislation that Nate and I had
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
typed up and it it was um it it had just
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
got messed up in the track changes so
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
that I know you had lots of questions
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
about it and we were kind of confused
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
about it too what it meant it literally
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
is a typo so using only the best
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
available accountability system can be
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
struck out so it would say the task
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
force shall develop a performance-based
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
accounting system using only the best
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
available data indicators which are
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
already available um and provided to the
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
department so that's what the existing
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
law says that's what the old law says
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
there was a typo and that's why we
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out what it was supposed
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
to mean um so so yes the majority of it
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
is from the existing law slthe old plan
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
um the existing law for some reason
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
lists out all of the College and Career
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicators like they're all
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
separate things but it's actually one
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
measurement so um The College and Career
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
Readiness indicator is a current plan is
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
a current indicator in the existing plan
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
and then there is 11 I believe TW or 11
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
or 12 subcategories of it which are
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
enumerated in current law but it's not
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
very clear from the current law that
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
they are actually subcategories of the
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicators
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we um grouped them all
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
into the College and Career Readiness
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
plan yes represent tal um I didn't I
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't notice that growth is in this and
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
I think growth was in the Essa plan and
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
also very I think it's very key um and
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure how you would put it
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
in but I know with Competency Based
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
education sometimes they have to they
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
people take the competency several times
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
or whether there you know there's a
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
growth over that period of time and and
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
that to me seems to be one of the things
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
that should be an indicator um and and
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's mostly encompassed by performance
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
on the state assessment because we
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
usually typically measure growth and
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
performance um sorry growth and
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
achievement under performance um but if
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
we needed to further enumerate that we
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
could I think that opens up a another
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
door here are we talking about a compeny
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
based assessment or are we talking about
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
a performance-based assessment we're
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the state assessment
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
defined under RSA 193c so which is it
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
it's a compet
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's neither of those it's just the
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
state assessment it's not it's not a
 
01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.039 align:start position:0%
performance basis it's so Mr CH just in
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
in this whole area where you know
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the the potential you know
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
indicators and and how to how to you
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
know develop a a pbass based on what
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
information is there a reason why why
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
the task force would be limited only to
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
data that's currently being collected by
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
the department or could the task force
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
suggest as as we've done in House Bill
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
1586 which is an interim study as well
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
as in House Bill 1680 from a couple
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
years ago uh other indicators that the
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
Department's currently not collecting
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
that could be used to help measure the
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
um the uh the outcomes of a um of a of a
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
school district so we use that
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
terminology because that's what's in in
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
existing law if the committee wanted to
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
expand that I think you certainly could
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
um we just need to make sure that we
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
have a a way of collecting it and that
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's I I think we just need to be
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
careful how much we're expanding on the
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
data no no that's fine but I mean giving
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
giving the task force a little bit of um
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
you know leeway to to to maybe suggest
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
you know an indicator that the task
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
force feels has value that currently is
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
not being um being collected I mean one
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
that we talked about on the the um
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
higher ed task force was the um uh
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
information about the number of students
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
that um graduate from high school and
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
matriculate to a two or four year or
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
postsecondary um and how it's being
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
collected Now versus how it could be you
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
know collected and I think you were very
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
interested in that uh um you know yeah
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's ex existing law and I
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
think so certainly feel free to change
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
it but we didn't want to expand much
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
more than so I mean this is really a
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
sort of a copy from existing law um I
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
mean we already do have the other
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
metrics and so I think that um if if
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
there was another metric that you guys
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
determined and you could certainly
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's just a reminder this will
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately determ this will ultimately
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
result in something that would need to
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
be written in law right and so you could
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
certainly strike that out or you know
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
say the department will collect X Y and
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
Z from schools but this task force is
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully come up with
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
something that will be a new RSA 193
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
whatever c yeah and and I I hope the
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
task force would have the flexibility to
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
be able to look at maybe more you know
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
additional indicators that maybe were
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
difficult or impossible to collect 10
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
years ago but but now um can be
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
collected either by by the department
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
directly from the districts or through
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
or by the department through uh through
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
a third party like the what what was the
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
one that we Clearing House the Clearing
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
House exactly so so thanks represent
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
cascaden then represent my um okay just
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
to try to move move on from part four
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
but looking at part
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
four um you just said something about a
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
a type a typo so I'm still thinking part
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
four is going to replace part
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
three and maybe that first sentence is
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
Chang to the task force shell develop um
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe maybe you're Crossing
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
out scoring
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
system but I don't know that there's a
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
need to list all of those if you just
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
reference a to O the 15 indicators in
 
01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
reference a to O the 15 indicators in
the

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
law and it sounds like you want to add
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
or we want to add that last piece that's
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
recommended other metrics as determined
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
by the task force so we're maintaining a
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
to O that's in current law and adding
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
other metrics as determined by the tax
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
Force so it leaves it open-ended should
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
there be something else but it's listed
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
here as if it's new but it really isn't
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's true the only the issue with it
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
being enumerated and current law right
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
now is if there are changes to the Essa
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
plan they're not Incorporated in current
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
law and we do feel like those college
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
and Readiness indicators really need to
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
be look like we think that is an
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
important indicator in the Essa plan
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
that should be looked at and so that's
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
the it it it's challenging if we have a
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
list right here and then a list over
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
here that don't equal and so that's why
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
we were saying get rid of the
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
individuals that are numerated and then
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
just refer back to the sa plan for for
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
the College and Career because College
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
and Career indicators are and a
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
requirement of the SAA plan but they're
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
not listed in this plan they're not so
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's just under C so it says
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicators
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
aligned to the New Hampshire
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
Consolidated state plan okay so you
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
could just so you just use C right
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
instead in addition to a to O um yeah
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
because in the existing law yeah that's
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
right so we're adding two more to the
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
original list in the law
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
right to point out the College and
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
Career Readiness indicators because
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
those are a SE list and they're also in
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
plan yeah so we're in the current law
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're kind of Crossing out
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
um D E F G H I
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
J K
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
L yeah those ones were crossing out in
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
the current law in the current law can
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
you repeat that please uh so in the
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
current law it is um d e f g h i I J K L
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
those are the those are the some of but
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
not all of the Essa um the college
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
readiness indicators in the plan what
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so those are not um indicators of the
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
Essa plan though I mean sorry those are
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
not college and indicators um but
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
see you have it as G here and M there
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
thing G here so yes right so we're
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to include that but but so
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
we're we're leaving G yes we're leaving
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
G that's why we're just the the middle
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
ones are essentially getting
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
indicators so we're
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
consolidating D to L because they're all
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness indicators
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
correct correct and they're in the
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
federal plan correct okay so then we
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
still need m n and
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
O although that would be reclassified
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
because you're compressing a whole bunch
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
and you're adding other metrics as
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
determined by the task force well I
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
think you know the department really
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a conversation too to say
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
like you know so are those things truly
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
a measure of an adequate education as
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
teacher administrative turnover rates
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually an indicator of if you're
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education or is
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
that something that you should be
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking at relative to the overall
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
performance of an education system which
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
are different same with the fasta
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
completion okay so would that be
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
something the task force would continue
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to discuss absolutely the other metrics
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
as determined by the task force because
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
we could be splitting here here I think
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
we're splitting here but I'm also real
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
concerned where you are I'm concerned
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure represent Cornell is same what
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
about F right what about the Creer of
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
technical Education certification and
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes there which we're trying to
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
grow that that program we know we have
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
to we should be tracking it f is
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
encompassed in in uh the College and
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
Career Readiness indicators so in the S
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
plan that's we're not getting rid of it
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's one I like it when it's spelled
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
right out Career Technical education
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay well Career and Technical education
 
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
so is it do we want to talk about I
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we need another category that
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about Career and
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
Technical education and participation in
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
career and Tech education so is it
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
participation is it you know what is
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
that I think I think maybe that's a
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
whole different category but then also
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
also though my question is is is that a
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
measurement of somebody is receiving an
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education well I would think so
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the achievement scores that kids coming
 
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
out of CTE are higher than they are
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
coming out of high schools but we're
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
already looking at achievement scores
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
for measurement of out education yeah
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um so CTE is extremely
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
important but again we have to think
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
those centers are not in every single
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
high school so they're Regional centers
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
as you know and I think College and
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
Career indicators would cover
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
some work or achievement within a Career
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
and Technical Ed Center but if you're
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
looking at a real small high school okay
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
let's take Pittsburgh has eight kids
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
probably in that senior class and out of
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
those eight
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
kids maybe half of them are going to
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
college and half are not and none of
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
them are interested in going over to
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
Canan C
 
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:26.950 align:start position:0%
Canan C
or

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
toook so now you have no kids in a
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
particular High School participating in
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
a CTE program just by design that could
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
happen what I don't know any any small
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
high school that has to travel to a
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
center and I I worry that if we put CTE
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
in as one of the
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
criteria so Mr it should be under
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness anyways why
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
you could put such as but not limited to
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education but I think
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's also spelling out that we have a
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
weakness in our CTE program in this
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
state a definite weakness and when we
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
have approximately 20% of the kids not
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
attending because they're an ascending
 
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.189 align:start position:0%
attending because they're an ascending
School

01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
correct and the 80% are in those schools
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
which have it internally and some high
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
schools require that all students take
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
CT a CT course for graduation
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
requirement in some schools with a CTE
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
Center don't require credit y for
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
graduation right so so I mean that's
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
another isn't this more task force
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
conversation though task I think it is
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's just vote that they'll have
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
a task force if this is all task
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
force issue then you should say
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
reference this statutory language 193 E3
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
just reference ROM was stated by
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
represent Cas except except having
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
having some flexibility to uh to
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
consider um new indicators that
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
currently aren't being collected by the
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
department and that would also be task
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
force discussion that that oh that
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
indicator doesn't make sense that
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
indicator does make sense you keep H
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
there in and put to reference the
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
current statute Cho as yeah as long as
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
as long as there's flexibility to have a
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
conversation in the task task force with
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
members of the department to consider uh
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
other factors and the department could
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
could come back and say yeah we can
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
collect that or we can find that
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
information or there's no way we'll ever
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
get that information that's impossible
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
to collect and then that's all task
 
01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
to collect and then that's all task
force

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
consideration okay are we good Roman for
 
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.550 align:start position:0%
consideration okay are we good Roman for
repres

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.390 align:start position:0%
repres
yeah

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
um mine is a more of a high level
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
question I guess and that is you you've
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
got these eight
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
indicators and you say a Performance
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
Based scoring
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
system how does that work so Performance
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
Based is basically you're you're looking
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
at that's what we have right now it's
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
the Performance Based accountability
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
system that's the actual name and so
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking at how the school's
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
performance on the various different
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
indicators are or how the schools are
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
performing on the various different
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
indicators and then doing some sort of
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
rank ordering or some sort of some sort
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
of something that's exactly what we need
 
01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
to figure out like how are you doing
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
that measurement um and then how are you
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
determining if schools are performing as
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
they they're supposed to be doing to
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
Prov like is the performance of the
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
school indicating that the school is
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education as
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to the other side of what which
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
is inputs like so these are things that
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
the state has said you're supposed to do
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes the you're doing all of these things
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
through ibass like you are offering you
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
know reading math blah blah blah blah
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
all of the courses and then but for some
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
reason the kids are not performing
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
through the other metrics and so that's
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's how the two systems work together
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
so one is looking at what are you
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
providing and then the other side is how
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
are you you actually doing and so the
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
assessment is the majority of the
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
measurement of that but it's also
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
potentially participation in the career
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
and tech ed education indicators it's
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
the attendance rate so if a school say
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
had attendance rates of 20% are we is
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
that is that school providing an
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education that's exactly what
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
we need to do we need to look at these
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
different indicators and say what is an
 
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
indicator of of a school providing an
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
adequate education and then s setting
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
ranges too like what is the approp rate
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
range so is it 20% attendance rate is it
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
80% attendance rate or do we care if the
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
school has 0% attendance rate but for
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
some reason 95% of their kids are
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
proficient on the assessment so it's
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's looking at those different
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
indicators and measurements and and
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
working through exactly that so I'm
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
going try to get this down to real basic
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
here let's take a tendance rate is there
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
a 1 to five just as an example do that
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
is I'm looking for what the metrics is
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at so on that one
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
category let's say attendance y one to
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
five five being terrific one being four
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes in at 20% of
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
attendance rate do they get a rank of
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
one that goes into some kind of a
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
calculation so so right now yes I mean
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly how the federal
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
accountability system works attendance
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
rate isn't but that's we look at how
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're performing and we say different
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
um performance this equals a one that
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
equals a two that equals a three and we
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
we and then we rank all of the schools
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
against each other and we look at the
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
different levels and and so that's
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
something that we need to determine for
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
this exactly like which ones of these
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
and where they should be measured and
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate we need to set what
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
the appropriate level is for each one of
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
these indicators that and that's what
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
the department does that's what the
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
accountability team does so once once
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
you have the metrics identified and you
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
go through each school and you look at
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
the indicators then does the school get
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a total score yes and then they
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
go back and say okay here's what here's
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
what determined that total score yes and
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
you can see where we're doing well where
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
we need to improve Etc so that's that's
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
what the system does yes that's and
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's what our existing system the
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
fallacy though to that whole system is
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're letting the federal government
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
waged the dog and and now that's where
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
I've had this issue with graduation the
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
69% level are we going to go by that
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
level or are we going to go by a 90%
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we are right we're let that 69% wag
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
us and that that to me is that's always
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
been the issue that we are a state that
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
prides our in being better than the rest
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
of the states but we're holding oursel
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the bar established by those lower
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
States right and that's the issue with
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
having the two systems tie together and
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
the graduation rate is a great example
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so how do we get around that
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm still oppositional to this
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
69% even though we said okay do it no we
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
get way we get around it by saying
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and we the task force
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
says any school that has a graduation
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
rate of less than 80% is not providing
 
01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
an adequate education bam I mean that's
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
what we do and that's exactly why we
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
need State accountability versus Federal
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
account and I'm not saying that 80% is
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
the right I'm just s a random number so
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that that's not what
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
the Department's advocating for but
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why we need a state
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
accountability system because a because
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
we're saying like what we're trying to
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
measure is if a school is providing an
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education which is very
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
different what than does the federal
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
government recognize kids to graduate in
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
5 years instead of four years no the
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't and so and
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's also when we're talking about
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
kids that get a high set that's not
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
recognized in the federal graduation
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
rate and maybe we want to have those
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
conversations maybe we want to have a
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
state defined graduation rate does we
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
say four or five years and maybe we want
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
to say we also want to do other college
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
completion so we want to do a GED or a
 
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
high set and include that um that very
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
well might be part of what the
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
conversation is and these are great
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
questions for the task force so rson
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you so I'm still in that
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
section four and the statute on page 64
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
with the list of indicators says shall
 
01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.709 align:start position:0%
with the list of indicators says shall
include

01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
the um proposed task force language says
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
may include the
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
indicators if we think they're all
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
important why would they be optional
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
so the shall include right now is
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
current currently aligned to law this
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
section of curtain law is not going away
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
until this task force hopefully comes up
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
with a new indicator list and probably
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
we'll say shall and then bring it
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
forward and we rewrite the current law
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
but we're saying hey task force look at
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
at least these things like you need to
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
look at these things I me if you want to
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
change it to a may you certainly could
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
but no it says may already I mean sorry
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
I shall you certainly could but um but
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say task course this is
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
what we want you to do this is what you
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
want you to look at look at at least
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
these things so so I think it should say
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
answer yes represent Tanner so are there
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
going to be like hybrid schools some
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
that do Competency Based or is this for
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
everybody now so everybody's going to
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
one system everybody already is on one
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
system the definition of adequate
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
education is Law and what schools are
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be providing and it doesn't
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
matter if they're hybrid or whatever
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is all public district schools are
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be providing adequate
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
education as defined by RSA 193e and
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
then we are supposed to we the
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education are supposed to
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
measure through the input based and the
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
whether those schools are actually in
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
fact providing an adequate education but
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean you have you have two
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
measurements performance-based and
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
correct so does does a school get rate
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
it on one or the other or they rate it
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
on both both that's what the law
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
requires and this is not changing that
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
we changed that it's it's not for
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
example input based you could have
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
accreditation and that would satisfy
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
your input yeah but uh we wanted
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
performance too so we said both I think
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
we did that a couple years back 2020 so
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
Al along those same lines though when
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
when um when looking at um indicators uh
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
to to that feed into the pbass and and
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
whether a a school district is or school
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
is providing an adequate education does
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
the department currently collect for
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term other mitigating
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
factors that might contribute for to um
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
um to to the performance um of um of you
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
know student outcomes whe you know for
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
for example one that might contribute to
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
low attendance might be um you know uh a
 
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
high number of students with with you
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
know fragile medical conditions or
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
something like that or one that might
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
might contribute to to uh
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
other you know lower performance might
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
be um you know high percentage of free
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch or or families
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
that live in poverty well I mean so I
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
mean we certain I guess it it depends on
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
what you want to as I said no too
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
quickly so we absolutely we have number
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
of kids that are free roduced we have
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
number of kids English language Learners
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
that are special education we have kids
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
that are participating in CTE programs
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
we have expens expulsion and suspension
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
rates we have attendance rates so some
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
of those could certainly be um used um
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
but to your point before there might be
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
other ones that the Department's not
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
collecting um that we may or may not
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to collect and and in
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
the in the current pbass do are those
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors considered in the in
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
the accountability um formula I guess so
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the current pbass system which is
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
aligned to the federal system we look at
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the performance of subgroups and so we
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
do look at performance of English
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
language Lear learners compared to the
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
total population or English or special
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
education towards that and that is one
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the um things that could categorize
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
you as a ATS or a CSI School CSI is the
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
performance of the whole school ATS is
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
the performance of a certain subgroup
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you okay let's get on
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
to the next R well because we have you
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
know a real important ones coming up and
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
cl to this one this this is the one I
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
think that's going to generate all the
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
concern and questioning you know beyond
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
where we've been so we're we're looking
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
at at
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
this I I'm looking at Roman five on
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
let's see excuse me no I'm going looking
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
at Roman four on our side the current
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
law verse five on that law and I guess
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
the question we're going to have
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
is on the Roman four side where current
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
law after the report is approved by the
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
Legislative oversight
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee that approval is taken away
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
from legis ative oversight now there's
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
no approval given now in this new
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
process recommendation things come for
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
consultation but there's no approval so
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
the this goes back to my point before
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
the department would need a new law
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
written so the the plan would come to
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature to actually write a new
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
perform so I think so and I just noticed
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
something and this was it was not
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be I gotta make sure it's
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
not it was not supposed to be repeal and
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
rep what I need to C
 
01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:41.590 align:start position:0%
rep what I need to C
E3

01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
C how did 266 get through them so no no
 
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.350 align:start position:0%
C how did 266 get through them so no no
so

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
so following duties blah blah blah blah
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
blah blah so this is not repeal and
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
replace the existing accountability
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
system the existing accountability
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
system is B and it's still there in law
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and the department would still
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
continue to operate the existing
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
accountability system until we had a new
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
accountability system so this group
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
would bring forward a plan to you all
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
and you say that's a great plan or
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's a terrible plan and somebody on
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
this probably table has to sponsor a new
 
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
new law that would replace RSA 193 EB e
 
01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.030 align:start position:0%
new law that would replace RSA 193 EB e
193

01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
193
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
e3b um which would then rep talk about
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
the entire accountability system so the
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
department doesn't just have the like
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the authority to go
 
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
Implement its own accountability system
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's in law and so that's why the
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would we thought was
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place to say all right
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
we we as the oversight committee will
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
develop a bill or we won't develop a
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill and what this reminds me it's just
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
like the fox overlooking the hen
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
house okay who's the fox that oversight
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee the department yeah yeah well
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
were you taking
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
where you're basically say taking when
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
this report's submitted all approval
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
away from the legislative oversight
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee and you don't have it's
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
basically not going to be submitted to
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
this board of education the oversight
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee yes but the findings and
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations is not saying what
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do are they supposed
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
to approve this is the board going to
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
approve it they can't approve it until
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
it becomes law no the and the board
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about it I mean the
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
board doesn't have legis is not going to
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
prove something until it's gone through
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight right it's got to
 
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
go through the law yeah I I guess I'm
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
confused because I mean the department
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to do anything
 
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
without a law this has to result in a
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
law yeah that would change the
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
performance Val or we just keep the
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
existing accountability system which we
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
would continue to run until there's a
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
new law so if the report comes back for
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
approval recommendations and then
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
approval from the oversight committee
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to make it a lot easier for a
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee like this to sit down and not
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
have to Wade through what we're doing
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
right now all over again when it's been
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
done through the oversight committee and
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of that committee so
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
right and I think that's what the depart
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
that the report shall be submitted to
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the the oversight committee that's I
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
think what the department was trying to
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
do that's why we would submit it to the
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so I guess I'm
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
confused or are you saying that that is
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
not enough or this is it it the gets
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
submitted to the board of education and
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee and it should
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
say gets com submitted to the oversight
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee before it goes to the State
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
Board of Education absolutely it's just
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
an informational item because the 306s
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
should have gone to an oversight the
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
legislative committee before it went to
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
Education because that's that's not
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's a mandate for the State Board
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah minimum standards we don't have
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
that Authority yet and I want to say
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
that's Ru making this is not Ru making
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
this would need a
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
law so I guess I I guess I'm I'm
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
confused because I I think this is
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
saying that it's going to go to the
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so are you saying
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say that clear enough or I
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
mean I certainly you can amend however
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
you want but to to me this says it's
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee no it doesn't say prior to it
 
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
committee no it doesn't say prior to it
just

01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
says um but the task force can't create
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
a PS would have to
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
be you I think what I heard you say
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
though Kaitlin is that the
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the task force if
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
they were to take effect would have to
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
be put into statute first exactly so it
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
would have to pass through assuming this
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
commit that is responsible for Education
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes and so maybe do we need to add
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
another sentence that somebody will
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
write a law about it or I I don't know I
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah something in between five and six
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 and six yes because in six
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're advis it's it's ad in but there's
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
no approval coming the the legislative
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is almost like an
 
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is almost like an
afterthought

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
afterthought
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
here um and that I'm certainly like
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
willing to have you change it however
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
you want so this right now saying the
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
Department is supposed to implement
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
pbass and that's what it's saying
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
Department supposed to implement pbass
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
as defined by RSA 193 E2 so right now R
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill right here does not touch RSA
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
193 E2 so so until RSA 193 E2 is changed
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
the department will continue to
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
implement the existing pbass system and
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
then if then while then when the report
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
is prepared if then you guys want to
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
write a new RSA 1932 the department will
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
Implement that too represent Celli but
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't saying the department will
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
Implement whatever the task for this
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's certainly not what this is saying
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
because the task force cannot write a
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
law right and and also in terms of
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
approval what happens if the legislative
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee does not quote
 
01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.109 align:start position:0%
oversight committee does not quote
unquote

01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
approve what the task force comes in up
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
with I think instead what we're saying
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
is that um the legislative oversight
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee shall recommend uh put forward
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future legislation
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
after review of the task force findings
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
if you think that makes it more clear to
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
that's I'm perfectly fine with that I
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
mean I think that'd be helpful if we
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
told the task force to actually do
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
something with it cuz you're right I
 
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
mean task force could do nothing with it
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
and then we Department goes around and
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
begs in you know each one of you guys to
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
put in a bill for us like we've done
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
with this and and some of the other
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
proposals but yeah I mean to get the
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is to get something in law
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
that the department can Implement that's
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
so right you're starting to take the
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
department out of it and you're putting
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
it in the hands of the task
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
force now you're I I I see the
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee sort of
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
being put to the side too and then yes
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to advise the the
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
legislature later we need legislation I
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
think that there should be more contact
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
with the oversight committee with
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
specific terminology saying you shall
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommend and you know or get some kind
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
of recommendation out of the oversight
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
committee on this before we go any
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
further I I'm fine with that I mean I
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
didn't think we needed to tell the
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
committee to act but I think that's
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
perfect ly fine that works out better
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
for the Department okay represent Tanner
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that was um one of the purposes of
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
having a legislator on the task force is
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that legislator could be from the
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so that as the the
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
whole thing is developing the task force
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
has input or the oversight committee has
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
input you know I I I can go either way
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
on that but I know that the the the
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
working group we put together just the
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
other day when we're talking about
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements for CTE doesn't
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
have any legislators on it I think we
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
can get what we want to have on there
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
how many people here have a strong
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
strong strong background in test and
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
measurement you can go through the
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
statistics and all that and the bell
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
curve and all that represent cascaden
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
probably has some but as as an
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
administrator I that was not necessarily
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
my bailey Wick it it's it's so we need
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
people on there the going to have some
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we want to come
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
out with and something that has some
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
Merit and and can be measurable and as
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
we've said before in legislation
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
objective just as a followup what I'm
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
saying is that instead of having the
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
task force meet over here and then all
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
of a sudden put their report on the
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee if you
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
had a repres they don't even have to be
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
voting but a representative from the
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
meets with the task force that sees
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
what's happening that can put some input
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
back and forth whether legislation would
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
be um practical or doable or enforceable
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
or however you want to do it I just
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
think my my whole thought was just that
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
they're in on the
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
process I I I
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't have any feeling one way or
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the other on this seeing that I feel
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
that this is really an executive body
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility but what they want to put
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
in laws our responsibility we should
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
have the oversight of what is
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
designed so I think that when we try to
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
get down into the weed sometimes we get
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves so spread so thinly for 100
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
bucks a year I so and so the department
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
can certainly take on this work right so
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
we we tried with 266 and we tried to do
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
it under advisement with a group of
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents we had a group of
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
superintendents come to the department
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
and work with us on that legislation but
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
we just couldn't get there with that
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
bill because there were so many
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions that came up and the questions
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
were like well shouldn't you be
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
considering this and that and the other
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
indicators and so when we were trying to
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
put forward we felt were truly technical
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
fixes with the existing law that's when
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
we got derailed with the conversations
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
of why are you not concluding CTE why is
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
the graduation 67% and that's those
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
those were the things that were in the
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
existing law and
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
so Nate and I took that into advisement
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
and we said all right we need we need to
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
add technical Corrections and fixes to
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
the existing law so we can implement it
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
and do our jobs that we're supposed to
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
be doing but then two clearly the
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has additional concerns with
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
the performance-based accountability
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
system which were addressed in this room
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
and so we really need to do a deeper
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
dive into that and that's why we thought
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
a task force was the best thing to
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
do I don't I I mean to be perfectly
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
honest I'm a little frustrated with this
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
because the department really did try
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
Nate and I are sitting in our offices in
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
the basement come over and see us in the
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
basement and we're trying to put
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
together the accountability system and
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
make it work and trying to teach the
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
schools on what they have to be
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
submitting and why they have to be
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
submitting it and then trying to explain
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
to schools well if we determine you as a
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
CSI school for the state accountability
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
purposes it doesn't matter how well
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing you're just in the bottom
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
5% and that's just and that's that and
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
there's also no ties into an adequate
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
education and also if you're not a title
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
one in school there's nothing we can do
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
to to help you and these are the
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're trying to do and
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
then also trying to like read through
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
this law in just in order and try to say
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right here's step one here's step
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
two but Step One is on this page step
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
two is 30 pages here step seven is back
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the book that these are
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're doing and and so
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we tried to do the first
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
time we got very derailed and we're
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
saying all right well maybe we
 
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
overstepped our kind of our skis on this
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
one and we are trying to pull it back
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
and say the legislature wanted us to to
 
01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:57.159 align:start position:0%
really talk about this in a um to really
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the entire system and that's
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
why we said like let's at least try to
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
do a task force then and and let let's
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
let's revisit the entire system rather
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
than just the technical fixes and
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
Corrections and and to be honest when we
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
brought that group of superintendents in
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
they sat with this and they're like some
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
of them said hey let's look at CTE let's
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
look at that and they said that put that
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
in your parking lot those are great
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
ideas but what we're trying to do is
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections and fixes to that
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
law so let's get it through the
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections fixed and then
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
improve it and that's what we had in
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
planned so with 266 our plan was let's
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
do the technical Corrections and then
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
let's expand the system now so we
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
scrapped all of that and our back to
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
this idea so if if you have a a better
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
idea so if you have a better idea please
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
tell us because because we're trying to
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
do what is in this very large book and
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're really stumbling through it and
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
and we we need help is really we share
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
your frustration when we're dealing with
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
193 c e and H right and it's convoluted
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's a mess and it's
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
disjointed uh I you know I think what
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
you got is is a framework here which can
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
work I think there's a few areas we've
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned where tweaks to it could occur
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
but in looking at how we're going to
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
move forward we got to have a plan to
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
doing that and what you've offered us is
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
the only solid plan um and I get
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
frustrated with our own legislature you
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
know we're having a pretty good
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
discussion here I don't know what Happ
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side of that wall this is a
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
great discussion I mean and I wish we
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
actually had time for some of these more
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
detailed discussions because it would be
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
like a lot of these sections a lot we
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
would really like to clean up and and I
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if maybe it's a better of a
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
summer discussion or something like that
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
too like where we can really get into
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
some of these weeds but well then you
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
have to probably rediscussed with a new
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee and different bium represent
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
cascaden so the bottom line is you know
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
that's why they say don't give anything
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the politicians because they get
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
nothing done I think that we should
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
support getting a task force and letting
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
them do their work we're going to have
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
the oversight
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
anyway but they need to have the
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
leverage of that task force to be able
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
to get into the nuts and bolts of this
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
to try to start aligning things because
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
at the same time they can't put
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
everything on hold in the districts cuz
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
the districts are still going to be all
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
account accountable for all this
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
stuff but I think we need to move off
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
the tables okay they need a task force
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
get it organized and let the task force
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
do their work and then let's get
 
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
do their work and then let's get
something

01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
done sorry I'm a little I'm I'm a
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
checklist just drives me crazy I think I
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
think we're recognizing something has to
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
be done and this is a process which
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
should work with a few you know who's
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
going to be chair we can do that stuff
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
get it in there uh but uh
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
I I concur with you um we need to do
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
something here it's it's it's not
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
working the way it is right now and I I
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
think part of that's not working is
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
there was an original task force and for
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
some reason the part probably part of
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
that we took it out of Law and we're
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
saying oh no that really was important
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
and there was a need for that
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
so I mean it'd be easier without a task
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
force but then you're letting Nate and I
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
make all the decisions which is scary um
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
but because the task force is going to
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time and resources of the
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
department but we also feel like by
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
doing the task force that will get it
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
done right and correctly and that will
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
like allow the stakeholders to be
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
engaged and involved and and whatnot so
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah are there further questions from
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent dry is there
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
an end date for this task task force um
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes September 25
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's going to be hard to get
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
done that's going to be hard but but it
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
needs to get done pretty so okay yes so
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just looking at that report
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
should be submitted annually this is on
 
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
page five of the draft there to the by
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
July 1st to the task force the Board of
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
Ed and the oversight committee so that
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be in perpetuity so
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's annually that's the um that's the
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
results of the performance so that's
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
basically who did how who performed what
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
on the performance- based accountability
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
system okay but it's going to the task
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
force doesn't the task force um dissolve
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
eventually um I we so we don't Envision
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
the task force to disolving the our
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
federal task force that we have right
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
now doesn't dissolve we have a group of
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
superintendents mostly um that are that
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
review it we meet I think four times a
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
year um and they advise us and we so we
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
try to meet before assessment season
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
after assessment season and then and in
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
the summer and then just once in the
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
fall just to kind of give everybody's
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
Minds around everything and that we're
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're continuously look looking at the
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
federal Essa plan we're looking at you
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
know school's ability to perform like
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we looked at oh I
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
I guess I was going to say recently but
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
not maybe two years ago at this point
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
was um the performance on the widda
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
system and we said maybe the indicators
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
that we determined were not appropriate
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
and we went back and we looked at that
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we then asked the US Department the
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
task force reviewed the scores the
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
performance of the schools other metrics
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
nationally and determined that what we
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
had said in our plan our Essa plan
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't appropriate for
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
um the WID assessment and we went back
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
and modified our state plan to change
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
the um score that we were using to
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
determine proficiency for the English
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
language so it it is something that need
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
to continuously happen to um to because
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
this is growing this is
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
changing you know you changed the
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
definition for an adequate education
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
because you add things like personal
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
literacy in and so the other one that
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
when maybe the original pbass was
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
determined that wasn't something so the
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
task force would need to say all right
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
well how do we make Ure that the school
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
is providing providing an adequate
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
education and appropriately measuring
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
its performance of providing P personal
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
finance financial literacy and so that's
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
what the task force would need to do and
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go away oh okay could I
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
follow yes okay because when I Envision
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
a task force it has a task it does the
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
task it gets this thing that it that
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
this pbass assessment and passes it on
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
but this is actually going to continue
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to be many tasks Force
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
correct well I mean because the law is
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
always changing so if you were going to
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
say you're never going to change the
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
definition of adequate education ever
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
again the task force could probably
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
dissolve but because it's constantly
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
changing because assessments are
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
constantly changing because everything
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
is constantly changing the task force
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be there and it's it's a really
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
an advisory group of practitioners um
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
that help the department because you
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
know the department has one
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility for implementing the
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
accountability systems the assessment M
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
and everything like that and then the
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
schools have a very different piece of
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually assessing the kids collecting
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the data everything like that and so it
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
works together hand inand the department
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
can't do its work without the schools
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the schools can't do its work
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
so further questions of
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn did a good job thank you yeah
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
coming well CIT we always appreciate
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
when you come from the Department
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
because you you you give us a a clear
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
picture whether we agree or not it's
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
always welcomed and and I know at least
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
from Nate and I and my other staff we
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that time too because we at
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
least we do very important work at the
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
department mostly because you guys have
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
told us to do the work someplace in law
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate being able to discuss
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
the work we're doing and get the input
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee and so we always
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate these conversations I just
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
wish you had gotten that data an analyst
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
I I wish we had as well but yeah next
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
budget right there's another banian
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
budget coming up sooner rather than
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
later so we we passed it unanimously out
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
of here it was killed in division
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
two or Finance not division two Finance
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
yep well thank you very much for coming
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a short break here
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we should even start
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
yet you you you can have that was that's
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
an extra one that I
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
had pardon
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
me oh you have one in the
 
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.910 align:start position:0%
me oh you have one in the
[Laughter]

01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
office okay thank you for let's take um
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
let's discuss we had one other Bill
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
scheduled for review I don't know if we
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
have the time to do it before lunch or
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
we just take and have a lunch break now
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
yeah uh we don't have a great rush to
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to deal with it's not an early bill
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
so we have some time here y so let's
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
just take a break now come back at 1:00
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
when we're scheduled to go forward with
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
the other part of the ad do for today
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're looking at exing
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
some bills here um 378 32 526
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
339 uh obviously and looking that right
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
now I don't think we're prepared to EXA
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
378 we just talked that and there's
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
obviously some amending language 526
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
let's see school we haven't just Hut
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
talked that and and that leaves SB 339
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
are the Bills which we didn't do
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had two bills which we
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
didn't and both of those need work too
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
so is there any need for us to come back
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
this afternoon pardon me that's the
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah I would say we're not
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be acting on anything this
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon it's probably wi after this
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
conversation here we're not prepared to
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
go forward with
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
378 so with that I don't think we need
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
to come back this afternoon why would we

getting out of here and so I'm asking
 
03:29:55.830 --> 03:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
that we only have discussion from the
 
03:29:58.750 --> 03:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
maker of the bill or the motion and the
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
second if the second cares not to ditto
 
03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
second if the second cares not to ditto
what

03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
the what the uh maker of the motion said
 
03:30:07.630 --> 03:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to jump over
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
378 seeing that we had a good discussion
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
this morning and a work session on that
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to have to have some
 
03:30:15.429 --> 03:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
amending language so we'll jump to the
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
next bill
 
03:30:16.680 --> 03:30:18.670 align:start position:0%
next bill
SB

03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
SB
 
03:30:21.189 --> 03:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
526 this is a bill relative to public
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
school facility condition assessment and
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
school building Aid grants for
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
temperature control and I Look
 
03:30:31.550 --> 03:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
to represent beler for a motion thank
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I would move itl is there a
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
second SEC second so we have a motion by
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative beler for to itl and
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's second by representative
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli represent beler thank you Mr
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
chair um so as you said this bill would
 
03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
seek to establish um uh studies and look
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
to give grants for uh significantly
 
03:30:54.389 --> 03:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
improved air conditioning systems in
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
schools but some significant concerns
 
03:30:59.229 --> 03:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
were raised within this we're looking at
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh the cost there there's very intensive
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
studies that are mandated to be
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
conducted at all schools within this
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill um and there's also some frankly
 
03:31:12.030 --> 03:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
unworkable Provisions it seems to me
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the requirement that a
 
03:31:16.510 --> 03:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
classroom be entirely shutter
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
should the temperature fall to 59° f um
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons uh I would
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
forward cordelli uh thank you um I just
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to add on to that that um the air
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
quality is already in law um so there's
 
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
no need to duplicate that uh portion of
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
it and um we've heard heard
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
stories um from the chairman about his
 
03:31:54.429 --> 03:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
days gone by with um
 
03:31:59.710 --> 03:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh winter clothes on um Heating units in
 
03:32:03.070 --> 03:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
his school and um the wonderful Aroma
 
03:32:07.269 --> 03:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
later in the day and um I think we can
 
03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
um get past those kinds of stories uh
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
these days without this
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill okay not seeing any further
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
discussion oh yes represent luno sure
 
03:32:24.830 --> 03:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
thanks um I'm I'm also going to be uh
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl um motion on this and
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
um and and but um not because I don't
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
think that the intent of the bill isn't
 
03:32:37.229 --> 03:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
spoton I do think I do think kids learn
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
better in an environment where where
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
where they're comfortable where they're
 
03:32:42.990 --> 03:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
not sweating where they're not freezing
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
where they're not boiling uh and stuff
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
like that but I think there's also a lot
 
03:32:49.710 --> 03:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
of things um within the school that can
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
be done to uh to improve student
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes one of which which I think
 
03:32:55.469 --> 03:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of conversation about
 
03:32:57.389 --> 03:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
around this table and we'll have more
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is uh is making sure kids are
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
adequately fed and aren't hungry in
 
03:33:05.309 --> 03:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
school and uh I think if the state's
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
going to be pushing money whether that's
 
03:33:09.269 --> 03:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
done at the local level or from the
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
state level to uh to helping kids learn
 
03:33:14.550 --> 03:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
better that would be the place to direct
 
03:33:16.510 --> 03:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh direct our next dollar
 
03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%

03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
Noble for a motion thank you Mr chair I
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
move itl second we have a motion made by
 
03:34:36.670 --> 03:34:36.680 align:start position:0%

03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
Miler represent Noble yep um we had a
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
house bill that also repeals FAFSA
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
um but um the difference is the house
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
bill added a Schoolboard policy for
 
03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
providing information to families about
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
FAFSA so I think most of us probably
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
feel that that is a better bill because
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to diminish the importance
 
03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:06.110 align:start position:0%
