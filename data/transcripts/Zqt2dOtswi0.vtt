00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning and welcome to
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee uh work session on
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 240.
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
um with this I would like to recognize
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber she has a couple
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
amendments that she'd like to speak to
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.889 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
when we got this bill
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
it I was very confused about what we
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
were trying to do and we were trying to
 
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:32.540 align:start position:0%
do it all in one
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
condensed sentence or a couple of
 
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
condensed sentence or a couple of
sentences

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
and so I talked extensively to folks
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth medical I talked
 
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
extensively to Senator Prentice I talked
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
to several other people and it occurred
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
to me rightly or wrongly that we have
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
two different things going on here on
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
the one hand Senator Prentice brought
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
the bill originally because she was very
 
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
concerned because a constituent of hers
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
had been told that she could not consent
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
to having her own DNA used in ways that
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
might be very beneficial to her for her
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
treatment and she was told that that was
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
not allowed
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I went to law school a long time ago
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I know things have changed but that
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
kind of made the back of my head blow
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
off so
 
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.829 align:start position:0%
off so
um

00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
many people have said that isn't the way
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
it is but clearly there is some kind of
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
a problem there and if if if we are in
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
fact and we haven't discussed it yet all
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
agreed that people should have the right
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
to consent I think it's very important
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
that we make it more clear in the
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
statutes that that's the way it is so
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
that was item number one and that was
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
the easy bet and then the second bit was
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
the use of genetic material for
 
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.769 align:start position:0%
the use of genetic material for
um

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:47.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
research purposes which is very
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everybody but again the
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
issues of privacy the issues of
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
ownership over your own DNA is of
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
Paramount concern to all of us so what
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass out are two amendments
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
the first one which is 1718 simply adds
 
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
in a sentence saying uh that the section
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
will not prohibit the disclosure with
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the written consent of the patient of
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
genetic testing or genetic analysis to
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
entities participating in processes
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
related to either clinical care of the
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
patient including but not limited to
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
evaluating potential options or to
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
clinical research so that's item number
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
one I'm going to start by passing that
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
one out
 
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
one out
just

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
here and I'm being stingy with the
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
copies because I need to have copies of
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
these that are committee thanks to the
 
00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:46.850 align:start position:0%
these that are committee thanks to the
committee

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
the second one attempts
 
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.329 align:start position:0%
the second one attempts
[Music]

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:28.250 align:start position:0%
[Music]
to

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:28.850 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah separate out
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
personal care and research so it's
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
a formulation that came from Dartmouth
 
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:46.129 align:start position:0%
a formulation that came from Dartmouth
Medical

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
just do this to have a few steps in for
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.730 align:start position:0%
so with that
um

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think the only thing that bears a
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
certain amount of looking at is uh the
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
second one which is 2023 1719
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
and as you can see
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
it has
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
the provision about genetic testing and
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
genetic analysis to clinical entities or
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
HIPAA business associates
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh related to clinical care of the
 
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh related to clinical care of the
patients

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is specific
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
informed consent for clinical research
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't prohibit the disclosure
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
of de-identified data
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
or limited minimum necessary data within
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
a covered entity that constitutes
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
genetic testing or genetic analysis in
 
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:21.620 align:start position:0%
the context of an IRB approved
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
retrospective clinical study and I think
 
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:27.500 align:start position:0%
that the stumbling Point here
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
may be that if you're doing a study
 
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.389 align:start position:0%
may be that if you're doing a study
uh

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
indicators like how old the patient was
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
and other things like the patient's
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and other things are actually
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
very relevant to the study
 
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.449 align:start position:0%
very relevant to the study
um

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so how de-identified things get is
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
an issue going forward so with that I
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
have set the groundwork and I will
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
turn it back to the chair thank you very
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
much I believe representative Merchant
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
also has some amending language I think
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
if we can get this all out in front of
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
us it gives us a better point to start
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
so if you'd like to distribute those and
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
then speak to those after you do thank
 
00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:49.449 align:start position:0%
then speak to those after you do thank
you

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:49.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
Madam chair can I speak to my Amendment
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
yes please do thank you
 
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.329 align:start position:0%
yes please do thank you
so

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to
 
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.110 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to
retain

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of what's here at the same
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
time to protect the patient
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
um where I'm coming from is that when I
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
was on the Board of Pharmacy there was
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
an issue that was brought to our
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
attention where a patient went into a
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
pharmacy to get naloxone
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
for somebody it wasn't themselves but
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
they were using their prescription plan
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
to pay for it
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's before we had actually had a lot
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
of the locks on it off the board now for
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
about four or five years
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
what happened subsequent to that
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
was the patient got a letter from his
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
dealing with the fact that they
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
considered him to be an addict because
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't get naloxone the question
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
was where does it flow because it goes
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
back to HIPAA business associates
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
because under the business
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
Associates HIPAA does allow for
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to get information
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
because you need it for billing
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that's where a lot of it came from
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
so I'm okay with having the information
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
shared amongst clinicians for the
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient but I'm not
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable with having the information
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
going to a HIPAA business associate
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
because it's very Broad
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the intent of this one
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
here was to narrow it down and saying it
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
only can be shared amongst clinicians
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
for the clinical analysis or involvement
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
with the patient care
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
I did retain the part about the
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
identified information I think from a
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
research point of view if you go to the
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
IRB board you need to have information
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
to help drive that decision based upon
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
information that's factual but it
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't disclose the patient because
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's been de-identified so that's kind
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
of where I'm coming from in this
 
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:04.250 align:start position:0%
of where I'm coming from in this
amendment

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
definitely appreciate that one of the
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have is around the
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
potential scope of The Limited minimum
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
necessary data and I I like the
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have representative
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
Merchant but I would I'd personally like
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
to see on a specific required consent of
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
any patient whose genetic data would be
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
used in a research trial perhaps letting
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
them know what the what the protocol was
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
and what it was being used for and how
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
they could contribute to that evolving
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
science on their disease State because
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not a fan of blank checks and I
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a good balance
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
to me that seems that may be a good
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
balance between what we see and being
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
able to consent if you want to and then
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
understand what you're consenting to
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
with that limited minimum necessary data
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it would be helpful or
 
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.950 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it would be helpful or
useful

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
for us to consider the two questions
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
separately and start with the question
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
about what the consent patient can send
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
to in the context of their own treatment
 
00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:14.870 align:start position:0%
to in the context of their own treatment
and

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.370 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.970 align:start position:0%
um
I'm

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.770 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:20.780 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
willing to go along with representative
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant's formulation
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether you are going
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
to recognize audience members or not but
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
I know there are people here who would
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
probably like to speak more probably
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
both to the clinical aspects of the
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
patient care and the clinical aspects of
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
the research
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
so that but that's up to you yes um
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I will be recognizing people
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
to speak I wanted to sort of figure out
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
where we were as a subcommittee so that
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
then that could guide the feedback that
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
we're but I would love to take up that
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
first piece because I think it's more
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
likely that we will be able to achieve
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of consensus on the first
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
piece because there are very few moving
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
Parts there and then go on
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the more difficult piece whether it's
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
if we can come to a conclusion that's
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
fine but I I really want to be sure not
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
been given the opportunity to consent
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
and in this case it was specifically and
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
this is where I think somebody with
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
clinical knowledge will be helpful to us
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh because while I agree entirely with
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
everything representative Merchant said
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that there is
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
some difference between
 
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.350 align:start position:0%
some difference between
um

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
the clinical care that is given by the
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
various departments in a hospital and
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
even Consultants outside a particular
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
field and submitting the
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
genetic material to people who are
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
conducting studies and making sure that
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
we are clear that with their consent
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
they can consent to having their DNA
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
sent so that they can be reviewed for
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of a particular trial
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and how we get there is
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
my guess is we're probably all agreed on
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
that but I think it does make sense to
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
take up one section of the next
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative merchants and thank you
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
madam chair I do concur with what trips
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Weber is saying break into two parts
 
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
the Weber is saying break into two parts
um

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
I do like the idea and Amendment
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
17 18 where president Weber talks about
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
written consent of the patient I'd like
 
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.270 align:start position:0%
written consent of the patient I'd like
to

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
further expand upon that because
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
many times when I've gone into a clinic
 
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.149 align:start position:0%
many times when I've gone into a clinic
or

00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
institution if you will
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
and I signed tons of documents and
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
basically at that point in time I don't
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
really don't want this buried somewhere
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
within 20 pages of documentation that it
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
really has to be specific and really
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
point out to the patient that what
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're consenting to and not have it
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
somewhere buried into a large consent
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
form because of the gravity of the
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
situation but again the information is
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
very sensitive
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
and be sure the patient does understand
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
fully what they're consenting to so we
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
could have some sort of documentation to
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
a clue that we're being very specific
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
about it I think good point reps of
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
Weber makes a lot of sense I'd like to
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
add to it and expand upon it
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
um I agree with that statement I do
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
believe that we should have more written
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
more clarity around that written consent
 
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:40.100 align:start position:0%
and i would support an effort to do that
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
with that should is would we be ready to
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
recognize audience members to speak
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
towards um so we will be ready to
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
recognize audience members to speak
 
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.100 align:start position:0%
towards the clinical care of the patient
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
and around the written consent of the
 
00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:56.450 align:start position:0%
and around the written consent of the
patient

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
but would you like to just
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
I guess if you raise your hand oh sorry
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
if you have a better idea and I I think
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
you need to go to the table and sit
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
because I suspect I I don't know whether
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are broadcast but in in
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
the event that they are it would be nice
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
that people could hear your voices even
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood I'm the vice president of
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
government relations with Dartmouth
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
health and with me is Dr Todd Morrell
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
um a clinician at Dartmouth Health uh
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to the Amendments that
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
have been proposed if that is the
 
00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:41.179 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the committee uh and
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
understand the desire to separate happy
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
to do that as well
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes thank you if we can speak to that
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
first section first that would be
 
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
first section first that would be
wonderful

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
if I may just by getting a little bit of
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
background to this issue because I
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
realized there was some confusion with
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
respect to what we were trying to do
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and to reiterate a couple points
 
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:09.860 align:start position:0%
the law of New Hampshire requires
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
consent to even take a DNA sample so we
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
already we get consent in compliance
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
with uh existing law
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
the the law actually precludes telling
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
anybody that a test was conducted with
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
certain exceptions one of the exceptions
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
is when you send the the material to a
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
lab to have it tested an exception to
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
what exception to a specific consent
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
requirement because of course
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be very helpful to have a
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
sample taken if you couldn't do analysis
 
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:47.900 align:start position:0%
on that by a lab
 
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:51.380 align:start position:0%
what the intent was to do
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
was to say
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to get consent from
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
someone a patient who's consented to
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
testing who to whoms the materials were
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
sent to a lab for analysis if what
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're doing is finding the best
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
treatment protocol available for that
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
patient I'm going to defer to Dr Burrell
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
to elaborate on this but we have we have
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
very little issue with the amendment
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
that was proposed by representative
 
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.310 align:start position:0%
that was proposed by representative
Merchant

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
Merchant
um

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
with the change of two words from only
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
allows to shall not prohibit and the
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because it only
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
allows would refer to the clinical lab
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
presumably in the previous sentence that
 
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.930 align:start position:0%
presumably in the previous sentence that
that's

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um more narrow than the initial intent
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill was was drafted so when we
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
pause catch my breath uh see if Dr moral
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
has additions clarifications he'd like
 
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:52.940 align:start position:0%
to make on that topic
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
I again I for for my purposes in that
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
first section
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh as this amendment written it really
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that that we have clinical
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
Partners who help provide some systems
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
enlarge the vast majority of those
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
systems have no interest in anyone's
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
genetic data they don't
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
see it touch it use it or anything like
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
that but in rare instances particularly
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
around cancer treatment and around
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
children with genetic diseases
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
um those systems may be necessary in
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
order to help them get to the best
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
possible care
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
so all for as a clinician all that I'm
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
really hoping for is that we can include
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
those Partners the way that we do it
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
include them in any other care that
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing for patient for patients
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
that we could include the information
 
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.210 align:start position:0%
that we could include the information
necessary

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
so that patients would have the
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear about the treatments
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
available to them so they had the
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consent to that treatment
 
00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
or decline that treatment
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
but that we may need that information
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
shared with in our
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
clinical systems in order to present
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
patients with their their best options
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I I think this as it's written
 
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
so I I think this as it's written
um

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
being able to share that analysis with
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
clinical entities participating in the
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient would would
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
certainly suit my needs to be able to
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
include those partners
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not looking to talk to insurance
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
companies or disclosed to business
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
partners or anything like that I'm just
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
talking about clinical partners for for
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
my purposes okay
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
in regards to the words you'd like to
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
change or recommend to be changed
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
could you say those again
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
just do it uh so I'm thank you for the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm looking at your
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1736 the first line of the new
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
proposed says this section only allows
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting changing only allows to
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
shall not prohibit
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Emperor clarification why does that
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
change make a difference because I read
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
the additional sentence of this section
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
only allows to refer back to a clinical
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
lab we're not talking about a clinical
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
lab we're talking about other clinical
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
partners that might do matching for
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:27.380 align:start position:0%
shall not prohibit because
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
the sentence may need to be different
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
and may need to be redrafted but when
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
you say shall not prohibit you're
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
broadening broadening broadening
 
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
broadening broadening and my intent and
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
the reason that I phrased
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
my section the way I did is to make sure
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
that we are focused once again on the
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
written consent of the patient
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
to use for the patient's care so that's
 
00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:58.580 align:start position:0%
what I put into
 
00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:02.179 align:start position:0%
Amendment 17 18h
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
I am happy to have it in the different
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
section I'm happy to have this language
 
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.690 align:start position:0%
section I'm happy to have this language
um

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:10.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
um
revised

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
revised
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
but when we get to the shall not
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit you are broadening the
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
permissions you are not limiting the
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
permissions so if we need to make it
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
clear that we're not talking about
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
limiting what you do with your own lab
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
then we need to say that
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
um I I guess as an attorney I have more
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
faith in informed consent and I probably
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
shouldn't but I also believe that the
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
people who are concerned about consent
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
read those forms and the people who
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
aren't concerned don't and that's their
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
choice so
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a certain amount of
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
how far do we go about protecting people
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
from themselves
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern with the shell nut
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
prohibit language I'm not wedded to my
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
own language I just
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
would prefer
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
something that makes it clear that this
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
is the patient's decision and that the
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
patient has to do something clear to
 
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:16.940 align:start position:0%
direct it
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh rather than just saying oh you can
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
use it for all of these other things
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like you don't have to
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
make that as clear in a consent form and
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
what I'm really pleading for is clear
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant and
 
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant and
welcome

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of the lab I always thought
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
the lab was a clinical lab so it's part
 
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
of taking care of the patient because
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
you're providing clinical care you're
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
not it's not direct care but it's in
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
direct care to the patient because
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
without the information coming from the
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
clinical lab it's difficult for any
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
provider clinician to do the work
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
without that information
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber I wonder if we
 
00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:10.570 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber I wonder if we
took

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:10.580 align:start position:0%
took
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants section and on
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
line eight
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
simply remove the word clinical as it
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
relates to clinical entities and say
 
00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:24.470 align:start position:0%
relates to clinical entities and say
entities

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
I know I'm suggesting striking that out
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
and saying analysis to entities
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
participating in clinical care of the
 
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:33.500 align:start position:0%
patient so
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
any entity that is related to the care
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
of the patient doesn't have to be a
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily clinical
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
entity and I don't know if that gets us
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
we yes we're amenable to other language
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
choices with respect to also includes
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weber as opposed to shall
 
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
not prohibit I mean whatever
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
articulation of that you think makes
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's question and I
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank it for the question because we're
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
trying to get the clarity that what what
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
how the importance of the role of a
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
clinical lab you've identified but
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
they're also a crucial role of other
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
entities that are facilitating the care
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
of patients that aren't enumerated in
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
this statute that we'd like that's we're
 
00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:26.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
is taking the word on line eight of the
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I proposed in Striking
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
clinical achieve that
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
and leaving the sentence as he
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm saying only allows as opposed to
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:53.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
yes I think it does uh I could stop
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
there but I will say or I could confuse
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
this further which is to say you could
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
also amend the first line that gives
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
permission to let clinical labs and say
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
other entities because that clearly
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
references the clinical care that's
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
provided I defer to you with respect to
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
um so Roman 4 starts nothing in the
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to regulate
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
or apply to genetic testing or genetic
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
analysis for diagnosis and treatment of
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
a patient by a Clinical Laboratory you
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
could also add in or other entity in
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
there I'm again I defer totally to the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with respect to whether
 
00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:39.019 align:start position:0%
you'd like a second sentence or just
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
elaborate the type of entities to whom
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
with that language what are you
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
suggesting or the tree line five genetic
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
analysis used for diagnosis and
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
treatment of a patient by a Clinical
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
Laboratory or other entity participating
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
in clinical care of the patient that has
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
received a specimen referral I I
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question I think it also
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
might point out the fault of my
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation because that's specific
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the receipt of the specimen and only
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
a lab is receiving the specimen that
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
another entity might be receiving the
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
results of it so as we talk this through
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
Mike frankly require two sentences as
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
opposed to one
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
I have another question subcommittee and
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
for both of you gentlemen looking to the
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
language of this at The Meta language on
 
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.889 align:start position:0%
language of this at The Meta language on
seven

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to go with the Shawna
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
prohibit just to put this out here this
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
section shall not prohibit the
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
disclosure with the written consent of
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
the patient of genetic testing or
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
genetic analysis to entities
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
participating in clinical care of the
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
patient I'm trying to pull together
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
these different equipments
 
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
again what
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're trying to thread here is that that
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
consent is not buried somewhere else so
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
how do we somehow identify that the
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
patient really is getting written
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
consent specific to this
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
and not have it and
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
20 pages of documentation they sign when
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
they come in
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
how about saying with the specific
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
written consent of the patient
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
so are are we now then down to just
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to say only allows
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
or shall not prohibit
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
I think that's the large remaining
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
question in my mind and I'm not a lawyer
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
the representative Merchant I'm going to
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
default to the attorney on the panel
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to read it in the
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
context of what came before but
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
in the section shall be considered to
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
regularly reply to genetic testing or
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
analysis used for diagnosis and
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
treatment of a patient
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
Clinical Laboratory that has received a
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
specimen okay so that's the very
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:12.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
I think that for me
 
00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:24.109 align:start position:0%
I think that for me
um

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
I mean the first thing is about what is
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
I do think we've got more stuff going on
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
there because there is the issue of
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
everything that it relates back to
 
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.609 align:start position:0%
everything that it relates back to
and

00:36:48.609 --> 00:36:48.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
I wonder if instead of saying only
 
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.810 align:start position:0%
I wonder if instead of saying only
allows

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
we say specifically that the section
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
allows the disclosure
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the written cons specific written
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
consent of the patient
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
and take out the word only
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
so it would read this section allows the
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
disclosure with the specific written
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
of genetic testing or genetic analysis
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
to entities participating in the
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're aligned on this and
 
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to back up and
 
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:36.500 align:start position:0%
articulate why
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
once again this section to to your point
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative whoever is the point
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of sharing data the
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
exception to that prohibition is for
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
sharing with the clinical lab to run the
 
00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.849 align:start position:0%
sharing with the clinical lab to run the
test

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
what we are saying is that we think
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
there should also be an exception to the
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
specific prohibition of sharing for
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
utilization of other clinical partners
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
that can actually help identify
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
treatment treatment plans is that fair
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
correct okay so
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
the adding back of specific consent is
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
counter intuitive and where we're trying
 
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
your microphone is off not
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
my apologies I'm going back to the
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
actual section and I wonder
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
if maybe what we need to do is find an
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
earlier home
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the specific language
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
not in the exception section which is
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
you say is clunky
 
00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.890 align:start position:0%
you say is clunky
and

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
H2 starts with as section one is except
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
as otherwise provided in this chapter no
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
individual or member of the family shall
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
be required to undergo genetic testing
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
as a condition of doing business with
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
section two is accept is required to
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
establish paternity or test newborns for
 
00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
metabolic disorders or criminal
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
investigation or prosecution
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
or the medical examiner no genetic
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
testing should be done on it
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
any individual or anywhere on any
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
Resident in the state based on bodily
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
materials obtained within the state
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
without prior written and informed
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
consent of the individual to be tested
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
parent Guardian a custodian of the
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
individual or the legal guardian or
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
conservator of the issue or the legal
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
guardian or conservative if the
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
individual is incompetent
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
no person shall refuse to perform
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
genetic testing or arrange for genetic
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
testing to be performed or to do
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
business with the individuals solely
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
because they refuse to be contest tested
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if perhaps
 
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:23.300 align:start position:0%
uh and then section three is the
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure which says except as in
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
paragraph two no person shall disclose
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
to any other person that an individual
 
00:40:33.609 --> 00:40:33.619 align:start position:0%
has undergone the testing
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
and uh consent consent consent
 
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:39.410 align:start position:0%
and uh consent consent consent
um

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if perhaps between section
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
2 and section 3 or between Section 3 and
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
section four is where the specific
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
language that we are talking about
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
should reside
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
rather than in the middle of a section
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I I would actually like to take that
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
a little further and zoom out or I
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
assume that you are not in the whole
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
section 141h but in the section 141 H
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
colon two I'm in 141 H colon 2 which is
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
where we are considering answer adding
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
this as part of section Roman four but
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that Romans 2 and 3 are
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
more related to this
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
and therefore might be a better place to
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
put it um as we zoom out to
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
um three four and five
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
um H colon 3 is use of genetic testing
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
and employment situations H colon 4 is
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
use of genetic testing and health
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
insurance and H colon 5 is use of
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
genetic testing and life disability
 
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:47.180 align:start position:0%
income and long-term care insurance
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
since we're looking at the use of
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
genetic testing in clinical care that
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
may actually stand better as its own
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
section so that we can discuss these
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
different nuances in these different
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
sections I'm not sure if I'm reaching
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
too far or if that might actually be
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
more appropriate way to draft this I
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have input from the
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee or if I would
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
have no problem inserting between
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
141 H colon 2 and 141h colon 3 something
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
that says use of genetic testing
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
in clinical
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
for for clinical treatment
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
and then just putting this section in
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
so I think that that one's that one
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
sentence I I think that's absolutely a
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
good start I think we may want to look
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
at some of the uses and the way that
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
this actually would be done because
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
we're looking at making sure that
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
essentially we're able to use biomarkers
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
for treatment and research
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
um and I think we probably want to flesh
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
this out more to understand the uses
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
um so I I do know that uh down at Dana
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
Farber they actually pay for the genetic
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
testing and as part of the consent they
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
consent for all that matching and all of
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
that research use
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
um so I'm actually hoping doctor that
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
you can inform us a little bit more
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
about how you use this what your
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
limitations are and what you'd like to
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
see ideally sure so
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
in order to to get into a clinical trial
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
for cancer patients right many many of
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
those right there are clinical trials
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
being run all over the country
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
and uh and if we have appropriate care
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
within our walls then we would get
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
patients into the appropriate care
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
within our walls but there are certainly
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
times that patients might those
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
treatments may not have worked they may
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
be failing the patient and at that time
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
we want to look more broadly for what
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
other people are doing treatment options
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
that they would have but that might
 
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.250 align:start position:0%
that they would have but that might
require

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:48.260 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
sharing information with a system that
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
can help us find those trials right
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's no person that can carry every
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
clinical trial in their brain and what
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
the requirements are so we need a system
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
to help us
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
find the trials for the patient and at
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
times that could include genetic
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
information such as a woman's broccoli
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
broca two status and things like that
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
so we want to be able to use those
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
systems to find the trials that that
 
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
might work for a patient that's failing
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
conventional therapy so that system
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
isn't a lab per se they're not receiving
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
genetic material they're just receiving
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
data results from that in order to help
 
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:32.540 align:start position:0%
them get there
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
the um you know we would generally if we
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
were talking about non-genetic
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
information we would consider that type
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
of system to be within the general
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
consent for treatment where we use
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
clinical Partners to help us you know
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
Outsource that knowledge of where we can
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
find the treatment and we just want to
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
use the that discrete genetic data in
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
the same way where within our general
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
consent we're finding options for the
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
patient because we just you know we
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
don't have all of that technology within
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
our own building we of course need
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
Partners to help us to to do that to
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
find trials and treatment options for
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
patients so we're just trying to include
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
those people in order to help find out
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
treatment options for the patients if
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's helpful in the house of some kind
 
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.870 align:start position:0%
that's helpful in the house of some kind
or

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's not well I mean for clinical
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
trials in particular yeah so they're
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
filed with the NIH
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
um they're filed with the NIH and all of
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
their particulars and then we have a
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
partner that that essentially goes
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
through all of those like catalogs all
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
of those keeps all of their requirements
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
for us that interfaces with our patients
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
so that we can see where our patients
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
would fit into all of the trials that
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
have been filed with the NIH
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
um what type of entity is that is it
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
that contract research organization or
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
another type of entity
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
I I guess ultimately they're a software
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
company I'm not trying to be silly in
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
saying that but they
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
um uh just like epic is our EMR as a
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
software company that helps us have
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
medical records uh this is a company
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
that that writes matching programs where
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
they take our data and that data and
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
they they find the overlap and then they
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
would inform the clinician
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
your patient who's coming in on Tuesday
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
to be seen has these other options
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
available to them and then the clinician
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
can present that to the patient so they
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
help us find that ahead of time so that
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
we can approach the patient about what's
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
available so is that essentially taking
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
that information that's available on
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
clinicaltrials.gov putting it into a
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
more usable and more searchable format
 
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
so that you can match the patient with
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
the enrollment criteria of different
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
clinical trials yes
 
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.210 align:start position:0%
clinical trials yes
fantastic

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I have another question is this lack
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
of access one of the reasons why
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
clinical research has not been as active
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth in more recent years than
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
it used to be in the past especially in
 
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.170 align:start position:0%
it used to be in the past especially in
oncology

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:53.180 align:start position:0%
oncology
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
particularly around clinical trial
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
smashing yes this is why we want to
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
press forward with this is that we have
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
been limited in our ability to get
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
patients into clinical trials
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
um and we are really trying to push that
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
harder that we have broader options for
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
the patients that we see that has been a
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
driver for finding this partner so that
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
we can find more options for them thank
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
you and then that'll come to more of a
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
re-engagement with industry that's
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
bringing these clinical trials to the
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
it is and of course it's everything
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's filed with
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
clinicaltrials.gov right so there are
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
industry interests in there that may
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
have specific drugs but there would also
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
be trials that are just protocols on
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
already approved drugs which you know
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
are academically based in universities
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily in Industry so
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
industry would be involved but it would
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
not be exclusive to Industry and has
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
this limited some of the research
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
efforts that Dartmouth itself wanted to
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
do as a study within the institution
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
the the lack of access to match this
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
genetic data
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
internally or has it just been an issue
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
that that that's not really relevant so
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
the the genetic data is not the largest
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
piece of that right the the largest
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
piece of it is just the ability to hold
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
all of that information together needing
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
a system that holds all that together
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
and most of the clinical trials data is
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
not dependent on genetic testing right
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
most cancers are not related to Bronco
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
one Bronco two and sort of known tumor
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
markers like that
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
and tumor genomics specifically were
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
excluded in the original statute which
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
is different tumor genomics being
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
different than someone's genome and
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
their DNA
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so so the genetic information is not
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the key issue there and a lot of that
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
work can be done without genetic
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
information but in some instances it's
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
necessary to help patients get
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
to their best care
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps me a lot
 
00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to figure out how to
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
simplify rather than complicate matters
 
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.690 align:start position:0%
simplify rather than complicate matters
and

00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind it's it's a nice
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
that Senator Apprentice has just come in
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at her original
 
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.089 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at her original
filing

00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:08.099 align:start position:0%
filing
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
which takes the first to the two
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
existing sentences of Roman 4.
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
construed to regulate or to apply to
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
genetic testing or genetic analysis used
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
for diagnosis or treatment of a patient
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
by a Clinical Laboratory that has
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
received a specimen referral from the
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
individual patient's treating physician
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
genetic counselor or another Laboratory
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
the next sentence which follows on to
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
that sentence so maybe not splitting it
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
is a good idea nothing in this section
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
shall be construed so as to waive the
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
requirement that the treating physician
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
obtains specific informed consent in
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
accordance with the provisions of this
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
section so there's the specific informed
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
consent right there
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and the original Bill added this
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
section shall not prohibit the
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
disclosure of genetic testing or genetic
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
analysis to clinical entities
 
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.490 align:start position:0%
analysis to clinical entities
participating

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
in processes related to clinical care of
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
the patient and we could either put a
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
period there or we could then allow the
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
or clinical research to go forward I
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
would say if you were putting a period
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
there and having the research piece
 
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.220 align:start position:0%
be addressed differently
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
because I think that if we went back to
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning and just had that section
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
apply to the clinical care of the
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
patient so we can solve problem one and
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the patient has the
 
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.740 align:start position:0%
right to consent to all of this stuff
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
which I think many people already
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
believed they had but let's make it
 
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.370 align:start position:0%
believed they had but let's make it
clearer

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:57.380 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
that might be the way to start and then
 
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
have a separate bill that addresses the
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
research questions that are much
 
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
research questions that are much
thornier

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
thornier
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
so that's just
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
my current thought on it
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I think that that
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
clarifies things quite a bit and that
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
bringing this back to the clinical care
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
makes it a lot more manageable task in
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
front of us because we want to make sure
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
that people have access to these
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
and I know I personally would be in
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
favor of um moving moving that period in
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
that sentence so that it's after the the
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient to leave
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
that research separate
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative merchant do you have
 
00:51:42.609 --> 00:51:42.619 align:start position:0%
something so track along with you
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
Richard which piece of paper are we
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
looking at we're not looking a piece of
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
paper we're looking at the original
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
um if I'd be glad to
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
put this in front of you because I've
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
actually gotten there
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's I in this is section four
 
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
it's I in this is section four
uh

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
and so it's the two sentences that we've
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
always had in front of us in non-bold
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
print and then it was just shall not
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
prohibit the disclosure of genetic
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
testing or genetic analysis to clinical
 
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.510 align:start position:0%
testing or genetic analysis to clinical
entities

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
participating in processes related
 
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:22.460 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient and I am
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
proposing putting a period after patient
 
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:27.740 align:start position:0%
because we've already got specific
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
it makes it
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm with you the only thing I get
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
nervous about is the word processes
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
um It's relatively Broad and my concern
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that processes could involve
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
again HIPAA business associates which is
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
kind of what I'm concerned about
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
so if you want to delete that and
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly would that
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
be making that line read adding to this
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
existing law this section shall not
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit the disclosure of genetic
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
testing or genetic analysis to clinical
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
to entities participating in the
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient yes
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
that works I would be okay with that I
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
would be okay with that as well okay and
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think the line above that if I
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly is on line five
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
it talks about actually goes into line
 
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.630 align:start position:0%
it talks about actually goes into line
six

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.790 align:start position:0%
six
the

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
requirement to obtain a specific
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
informed consent so we're also so the
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
specific is in there already in the
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
statute and what we would do
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
shall not promote the genetic testing or
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
genetic analysis to we're going to
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
remove the word clinical from Senator
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
prentice's original formulation
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
and then we are going to put the period
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
after patient is that correct and
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry what do we do with
 
00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:15.130 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry what do we do with
processes

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
participating in the clinical care in
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient right
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
you could you get to go out to OLS I I'm
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
writing it down and I will confirm with
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
you that I have the language correctly
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
um as I'm writing this down is is that
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
language that would meet your needs as
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
far as the clinical care goes
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
I I think so I I
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just a doctor I don't write laws so
 
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.030 align:start position:0%
I'm just a doctor I don't write laws so
I

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:44.809 align:start position:0%
I
um

00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:44.819 --> 00:54:46.849 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think in the the questions around the
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
specific consent if they're consenting
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
to the general treatment if they're
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
conceited consent to treatment would
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
allow us to work with our clinical
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
entities then yes that would accomplish
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
what I want or what I'm hoping for
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
fantastic and it already requires the
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
specific and sort of informed consent in
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
order to collect that genetic
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
information for the clinical we already
 
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
and that that's already in the statute
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
so presumably you're already doing that
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
we already get consents to do treatment
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
I mean well in reality patients go to a
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
special Clinic they've made an
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
appointment like they know full well
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
that they're going for genetic testing
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then there's specific consent on
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
that day when they're there it's more
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
than it's much better than buried in a
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
list I mean they
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
to do that testing they have made an
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
appointment they're seeing someone
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
especially to do that testing I I think
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's in reality it's quite clear to the
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
patient what's going on
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative please be clear
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
about this again by retaining the word
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
entities versus saying clinical entities
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
that's relatively Broad and also talking
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
about entities involved with the
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient which is
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're trying to get to
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
right I'm looking for those those
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
partners that we need to use to take
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
care of the patient that's instead of
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
the end of the word entities as long as
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
those entities are somehow contributing
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
to the clinical care of the patient
 
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.250 align:start position:0%
to the clinical care of the patient
so

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to read back one
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
more time the last part of the sentence
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
um yes my first question is uh
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did you want to
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
keep it as clinical entities or entities
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
participating in the clinical care
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
energy is fine entities participating in
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
clinical care the patient okay then I
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
will read that sentence again this
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
section shall not prohibit the
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
disclosure of genetic testing or genetic
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
analysis to entities participating in
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
the clinical care of the patient
 
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:49.700 align:start position:0%
and you have a
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you I just
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on what we're saying
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
right now in making sure that it's
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
acceptable for clinical care of the
 
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.270 align:start position:0%
acceptable for clinical care of the
patient

00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
with those changes in eliminating the
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
research you know descriptor right now
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're suggestion in my mind another
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
bill down the road dealing with the
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
research component of this exactly in
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
allowing the clinical care to go forward
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
including the sharing of the genetic
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
material like bracket genes or whatever
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
with entities that can help then Place
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
patients into protocols for the
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
so as these changes are made does that
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
allow clinicians to do that without the
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
research component added to that meaning
 
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
that as the research goes on
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
in my mind they are somewhat intertwined
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
because they do add to the body of
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
knowledge the up the the most recent
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
research to make sure that if the
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
information is withheld from the
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
research I'm afraid that this may delay
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
clinical care down the road
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
am I wrong about that I'm just I'm
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
worried about leaving out research now
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
putting a bill forward which means next
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
year that we have a bill potentially
 
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
versus an amendment that includes
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
research at this point in time
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's because we could
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
think about researching sort of
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
broadcasters right there is
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
um research that actually happened
 
00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:13.099 align:start position:0%
to a person himself
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
sorry your microphone is off could you
 
00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
turn that on in case we are broadcasting
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there's research that applies
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
to the patient themselves and is ongoing
 
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:24.260 align:start position:0%
and that has thorough consent
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
lengthy consent going through all of the
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
pieces related to that and this clinical
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
therapist would still let us do that
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
sort of research right so you're in a
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
clinical trial you're in a research
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
protocol someone is watching to see what
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
happens when you get this treatment so
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
that is research the second piece which
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
is getting put off but is still quite
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
important to me is in the look back
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
research is in retrospective analysis
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
where it may not be possible to obtain
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
consent because it could be decades
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
since this patient was seen
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
uh it may not be possible to obtain
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
consent and there we want to be able to
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
use in really a minimum necessary or if
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
necessary a de-identified way to look
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
back at those records in order to do
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
retrospective research so for clinical
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
care or prospective research I think the
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
first piece would cover what we need for
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
the retrospective being able to look
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
back and do analysis
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
to discover
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
new things we really need the second
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
piece to do that
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
can I could I just start
 
00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:31.670 align:start position:0%
can I could I just start
um

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
we began with the proposition that there
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
are two different things going on here
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very clear to me
 
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
that the research piece
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be a much longer process
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
than we have time for
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
and so what the committee subcommittee
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
to pieces and what we're talking about
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
now is just going ahead with what is
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
needed for clinical care and then
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
I understand the urgency of the other
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
piece but I would rather I I'm in half a
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
loaf mode right now I would I would
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
rather make things clearer for clinical
 
01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:21.859 align:start position:0%
care and then bring another bill
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
because otherwise our choices are
 
01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
certainly we can try one more effort at
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
this but I don't know how long I mean we
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically have till the beginning of
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
June but uh in point of fact the
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
beginning of June is coming upon us very
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
quickly and we have to notice everything
 
01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.250 align:start position:0%
quickly and we have to notice everything
so

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
um you know the other possibilities are
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill I'm not very
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable retaining it I'd like to
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
have something come out with respect to
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
possible care so sorry to interrupt
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
represent it the only thing that I would
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
say is
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
um it's the challenge around the
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
research piece is because of the
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
distinction between de-identified and
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
minimum necessary I think we much prefer
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
that you just adopt de-identified and
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
then you get three quarters of a loaf as
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the debate with respect to
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
minimum necessary which I agree is
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
subject to a longer conversation which
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're happy to engage in but that would
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
that would be an unfortunate in our our
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
opinion Omission since I don't think
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
that piece is that controversial
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
so if if we were to then add another
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm working from the words of
 
01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:39.170 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm working from the words of
uh

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
17 19 H here
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
as we also say the following on to the
 
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
section that representative Leon drafted
 
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.020 align:start position:0%
this section shall not however prohibit
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
and let's take this the however out
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
shall not prohibit the disclosure of
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
de-identified data
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
and we'll cross out or limited minimum
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
so de-identified data within a covered
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
entity that constitutes genetic testing
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
or genetic analysis in the context of
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
IRB approved retrospective clinical
 
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
IRB approved retrospective clinical
studies

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
I understand that representative Kirk is
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
very unhappy with that but I'm I'm just
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
asking the people who have been talking
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
about the conversation all the way
 
01:02:36.609 --> 01:02:36.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we're also out of time just so you
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
all know that would be a huge step
 
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.109 align:start position:0%
all know that would be a huge step
forward

01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
so if it reads this section shall not
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit the disclosure de-identified
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
data and striking limited minimum
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
necessary data within a covered entity
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
that constitutes genetic testing or
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
genetic analysis in the context of IRB
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
approved retrospective clinical studies
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh so I wrote down very similar to
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
that I added to the section I had the
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
section shall not prohibit the
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure of genetic testing or genetic
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
analysis to entities participating in
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
the clinical care of the patient or
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
de-identify data in the context of IRB
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
approved retrospective studies okay does
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
that does that meet the de-identified
 
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.250 align:start position:0%
that does that meet the de-identified
data

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
she's just shortening it out as a
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
researcher it's not my
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
but it's a huge stepfather
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and then we can look to look
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the larger picture about people who
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
want to contribute more information to
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
research especially those people with
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
these with these rare diseases
 
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.430 align:start position:0%
these with these rare diseases
foreign

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um did Senator Apprentice
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
leave to go to another meeting I was
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
hoping to I was hoping to see what she
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
thought about this she was okay I talked
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
to her before she left um I suppose did
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I specifically asked her about her
 
01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
return to her original formulation I
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
thought we'd gotten beyond that but we
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
clearly haven't although I did not speak
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
to her about the research part of it it
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
was only on the consent and she was not
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
unhappy about the research part of it is
 
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what she was
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about was that the whole thing
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
might go south because of the research
 
01:04:16.569 --> 01:04:16.579 align:start position:0%
part correct
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
I think Madam chair we could I saw uh
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
reps of The Honorable Neil Park out
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
there with his hands waving we may want
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
to hear from him as well
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
I I thank you gentlemen very much for
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
being here we appreciate you being here
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time and
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
attention to it I really do appreciate
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
it absolutely thank you uh The Honorable
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk would you like to share your
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
perspective on this with us
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
and bearing in mind that we are now over
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
time for the committee yes and and we
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
are moving into our executive session
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
time so thank you very much Madam
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I think you've done some very
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
good work on the clinical part of it and
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have any problem with allowing
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
access to de-identify data because that
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect an individual's privacy
 
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.010 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect an individual's privacy
however

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
you don't Define de-identified and by
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
using the IRB in that sentence you in
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
effect allow them to determine what
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
de-identified is and their definition of
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
de-identified is not what you and I
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
would think
 
01:05:15.299 --> 01:05:16.730 align:start position:0%
would think
so

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
if you just use the word de-identified
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
and don't do anything further but
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate the IRB The Mention Of IRB
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
you've gone one step further to making
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
it clear to everyone especially since
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
the record will show that you took out
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
by our IRB that you're talking about
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
true de-identification because the IRB
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
allows in certain cases much more
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
information that would allow for
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
identification of individuals and they
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
justify that by the needs the necessary
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
needs of research the point is it's
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
outside the control of this body and I
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
think this body needs to Define what
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
they mean by de-identification in my
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
concept that means that it's not
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
possible to put a name
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
no matter what other information you get
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
from no other from whatever resources
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to put a name with the
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
data they don't have that concept if you
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
like my concept you need to take IRB out
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
if you put IRB in there then you're
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
basically solving the research problem
 
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
because that's what Dartmouth needs they
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
want to use the IRB criteria to access
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
data without consent
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
um I have a question for you if we add a
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
definition of the term di identified
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
data into the um into the the section
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
one of this bill where it has the
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
definitions in order to narrow it down
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
to de-identified data in a way that's
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
protective of individual privacy as you
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to describe for us but
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
then allowed it only in the context of
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
IRB approved retrospective studies so
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
that we do have some other controls on
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
that because that works competing at
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
interest that works if you could provide
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
that language we'd love to be able to
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
try and get this drafted is that
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
something that would work for both of
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
you to have a definition if we agree I
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
think we're going to need another
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting to look at that I I
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
think if perhaps The Honorable you know
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
sort of can circulate that to both Mr
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
hood and and the committee we can think
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
about it but I think I think that we're
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
not going to resolve it now and I do
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
think we need to have more discussion
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
before we get to a final we'll have that
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
in or in your inboxes tomorrow morning
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you fantastic
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant thank you so
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
my understanding isn't IRB
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
so therefore is are we
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're concerned is I don't
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
disagree with you what I'm saying though
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
is by striking the IRB on line 14.
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
indirectly or as well as directly are we
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
still including the rrb because it's
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
part of the covered entity
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry but I don't know the answer
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
to that I think uh they would folks from
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth might be able to answer that
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um I'm thinking
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you I I
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
think we will we need to come back for
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting on this um
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we will speak to and we'll figure
 
01:08:20.289 --> 01:08:20.299 align:start position:0%
out a time for that
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
yes we need to have that submitted by
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
three o'clock today so we will speak to
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
our availability and get that into the
 
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.169 align:start position:0%
our availability and get that into the
calendar

01:08:29.169 --> 01:08:29.179 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
and so if that's acceptable at all I
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
think we've made some good progress
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually now that I am available both
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and Wednesday next week for your
 
01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
see you next Tuesday is going to be the
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
16th yes I am and the 17th we could do
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
it again before this week
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I am available on the 16th I'm not
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
um does 10 30 work for both of you
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so we will have another meeting at
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee at 10 30 uh next
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 17th
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
is our are there any major conflicts
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic we are the only ones that
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's when we will be
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
meeting Tuesday at 10 30 next week
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I will close the
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on Senate Bill 240.
 
01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:31.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
oh sorry the sixth thank you very much
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
the 16th I apologize
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's Tuesday the 16th I have a field day
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
on the 17th that I will not miss
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.179 --> 01:10:27.290 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
I am not the chairman but I'd expect we
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't start until at least 10 10 because
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
I thought there was still a lot of holes
 
01:12:44.280 --> 01:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
I thought there was still a lot of holes
anyway

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
morning everyone and welcome to the
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%

uh first one is uh Senate Bill 239 I
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
know that a number of members had
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
concerns last week we had some
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
significant amendments offered uh I'm
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
here and we may even have amendments
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
today uh so anyway I'll just open up the
 
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.310 align:start position:0%
today uh so anyway I'll just open up the
floor

01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
um for any uh you know any uh comments
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
before we
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
potentially make a motion
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel you have a 230
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I have some of that one Amendment
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
okay yeah you you never made me nervous

when you said some amendment I have 412
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendments okay I I we I think we'll
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
have a formal Problem by the time you
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
get to the 412th one but sounds like
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:22.510 align:start position:0%
another bill
anyways

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%

oh yeah
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I would like to make a motion uh uh
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
to support Amendment
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%

where is it I'm sorry give me one
 
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:43.460 align:start position:0%
breaker yeah

this isn't the number they sent me
though

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do yes I'm going to
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
and then I want to just so that we're
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
not referring to nebulous things I made
 
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:26.140 align:start position:0%
a copy of um
 
01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.950 align:start position:0%
a copy of um
[Applause]

01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
the from the governor's Commission on um
 
01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:32.030 align:start position:0%
the from the governor's Commission on um
opioid

01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I thought it would be helpful for you
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
to know what that actually says
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
because that has a lot to do with harm
 
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.050 align:start position:0%
because that has a lot to do with harm
reduction

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
and then I also made a copy of
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
um the criteria that we use in the
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission for deciding
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to fund for the same
 
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.729 align:start position:0%
what we're going to fund for the same
reasons

01:20:54.729 --> 01:20:54.739 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you need more than that don't
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
you sorry one more one more yeah
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nagel you've moved
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
your Amendment representative Missouri
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
seconded it and uh discussions in order
 
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.689 align:start position:0%
seconded it and uh discussions in order
okay

01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
I came totally prepared and I'm totally
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
not prepared
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
um so there's two definitions that we've
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
changed as you know from the very
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
beginning we're concerned is that there
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
were two issues that were not well
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
defined in the original Bill one was the
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
issue of drug misuse and that was a big
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
in multiple places to change the
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
terminology of abuse to misuse and then
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
also um to add harm reduction which was
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
also not defined um I've talked with the
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill about this I've met
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
with a couple folks from HHS to talk
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
about this and we talked about this and
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement Commission
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
meeting on Monday
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's important to note that five
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
members I believe of the governor's
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
are also in that group so we had a
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
fairly broad discussion about this um
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
and we all pretty much agreed on these
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
definitions so
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
as a background and I want to tell you
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
why this is important so um to me and
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
so about 30 years ago
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
um when we were planning on changing
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
opioid policy in this state and trying
 
01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:38.300 align:start position:0%
to make this a multi-stakeholder process
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
to minimize the harm that may eventually
 
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
result which to some degree did
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
um we had a meeting in New York City
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um with all stakeholders from the DEA
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
the FDA to doctors to nurses to patient
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups to everybody we sat down
 
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
and chatted about this but one of the
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
more interesting presentations that was
 
01:22:58.739 --> 01:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
more interesting presentations that was
given

01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
was from a sociologist that actually
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
studied the whole process of of
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
addiction and what she did was she
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually went to the streets of New York
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
and interviewed drug dealers and um that
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
was kind of to find out like why are you
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
doing this that kind of stuff and what
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
she came back to us with was this
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
interesting group of people called
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
Street doctors
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
um what they were doing was totally
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
illegal but it was actually honorable
 
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:29.540 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
was they
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
um if you needed a drug or some sort for
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
your blood pressure for your diabetes
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
for your anxiety for your psychosis for
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
your pain they would have it and they
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
felt that they were doing the community
 
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
of service they tended to deal with more
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
low-income people that had limited
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
access to the Health Care system and
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
they insisted that they were doing a
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
good thing and the reason why this is
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
important is when you look at the whole
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
concept of what's going on here these
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
people are using pharmaceutical agents
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
illegally for legitimate legitimate
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
medical purpose
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where the term misuse as
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to abuse came from and that's
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
why the the distinction is really
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
important for me personally as we
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier if you look at the
 
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
latest CDC guides to opioid prescribing
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
they point out that 70 of the instances
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
of misuse
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
um which is a a catch-all category that
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
includes diversion and abuse
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
um are due to people it's basically
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
self-medicating that they're not getting
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
the treatment that they need they can't
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
afford the treatment they need and and
 
01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
they're getting uh substances for other
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
reasons and to me that's why this
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
distinction was really important to
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
change the wording from abuse to misuse
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
this bill basically empowers the
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs and the opioid emission
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission to actually
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
work together to solve problems with
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
abuse and misuse the bill that we passed
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
earlier this year HB 66 is is actually
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
in a sense a harm reduction type bill
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
that creates a committee to create a um
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
pilot program and hopefully eventually
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
State policy to find alternative ways to
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
manage pain so that people in pain don't
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
have to go to the streets to get their
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
medications which is definitely
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
happening now by changing that language
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
you actually open up this bill to the
 
01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
potential of getting opioid abatement
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
money which is about 310 million dollars
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
in total so without this language that
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen so that's why that's
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
important I'm sorry I have my computer
 
01:25:40.199 --> 01:25:40.970 align:start position:0%
important I'm sorry I have my computer
um

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to if anybody has questions
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
on that maybe is a good time to ask now
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then I'd like to go into harm
 
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
and then I'd like to go into harm
reduction

01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
um or I can just go right any discussion
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
any discussion at all right I just want
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
to commend perhaps of um Nagel because
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
on line seven
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
the use of the word substance
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
which includes of course alcohol as well
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
so I want to Commitment for using that
 
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:09.950 align:start position:0%
so I want to Commitment for using that
word

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.390 align:start position:0%
word
okay

01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm always happy to take
 
01:26:15.850 --> 01:26:15.860 align:start position:0%
credit for things I didn't do but um
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
that that's actually at a much higher
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
level than me so I will forward that on
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
to the people it response representative
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
I should proceed then if we have other
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
and then the other issue was harm
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and and I like to explain why
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it's appropriate to
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
put the terms harm reduction in a bill
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
without defining what it means
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I had tinkered with the definition
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
with a whole bunch of people originally
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
came up with what I presented last time
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and I as time went on uh and talked
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
with some of the folks from HHS I became
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
less happy with with doing that
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so what you're seeing right now in
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
the bill is actually the the direct
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
language from the samsa which is the
 
01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:00.620 align:start position:0%
substance abuse mental health services
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
Administration they basically oversee
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
mental health function and substance
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
abuse for the entire country I've worked
 
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
with them in a number of settings
 
01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:12.500 align:start position:0%
creating um
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
symposia on other things so I do know
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
these people fairly well
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
um the reason why this is important is
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
number one as I've handed out
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
um this is already included in the
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
01:27:28.729 --> 01:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs so to pair the two it's
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
important language that we share
 
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.290 align:start position:0%
important language that we share
um

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
um the Senate Bill 32 that we already
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
passed has this language in it and I
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
thought again it was important to Define
 
01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
thought again it was important to Define
that

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.610 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I hadn't really
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
thought about that was pointed out at
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
our commission meeting on Monday was
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
that in addition to getting funding
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
um you know organizations that come
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
through the governor's Commission in
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
addition to getting funding from opioid
 
01:27:59.810 --> 01:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
abatement the state and other things
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
they also get money from samsa and
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the I can't remember who it was who
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
said it but she said it's really
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
important that the language be paired
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
for that purpose alone so that we're
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with the same wording when we
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
talk about State funding from outside
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.229 align:start position:0%
the state
um

01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
I will also point out that um this Bill
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
had the unanimous support of both the
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission and the um
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission and these
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
definitions did so
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm done if there's any questions any
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
other questions discussion yes
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you and
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to understand because
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
I feel like I think I saw this bill 16
 
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
or this amendment last week 1618
 
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and then received a subsequent email
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
but the language in the harm reduction
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
is identical to that with samsa as you
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is what I'm confused
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
about except that it does not include uh
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
after Health Care Services you know when
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
you in this one right here it says again
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
promoting a philosophy of Hope Etc et
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
cetera at the very end but the email I
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
got stopped short of that at Healthcare
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
Services but I'm pretty sure I saw this
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
1618 last week and we were going to
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
change that is that a minus you're right
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
this is wrong and I don't they they gave
 
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
me the wrong one
 
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:22.340 align:start position:0%
I really apologize for that um
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
and I didn't I emailed out the right one
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
to everybody right in the right one or
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
the one that you sent out to everybody
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
is exactly identical both in the
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
description of the word misuse but also
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the harm reduction except for it
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
didn't include the part of the sentence
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
that begins with and uh promoting a
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
philosophy of Hope and I was just trying
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
to clarify that's all so if you if what
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
I can read for you this 1702 is the
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
correct number
 
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay um and I don't know protocol wise
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to be saved that you
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
said you sent it up here you made an
 
01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
email I emailed it out yesterday uh or
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
two days ago
 
01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.250 align:start position:0%
two days ago
1702.

01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
1702.
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
I think the language was emailed up but
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
not the amendment I'm sorry because this
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
language this is what I pulled out from
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
upstairs and I didn't review it
 
01:30:11.649 --> 01:30:11.659 align:start position:0%
beforehand I really apologize
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
could perhaps our researcher go and get
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
the text of the proper Amendment so we
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
would have it could you help us out with
 
01:30:22.139 --> 01:30:22.850 align:start position:0%
would have it could you help us out with
that

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:24.620 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
apparently 1618 was reprinted by mistake
 
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
so we don't have the one with the
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I'm very sorry about that
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
I went to Great Lengths to make sure we
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
had the right one
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
I know there were concern a
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't know if we're
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
just killing a few moments time while
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for that I've got a
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
question that's true absolutely maybe
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
um maybe Dr Nagel can answer um I was
 
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
really intrigued by the street doctors
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
you were talking about yes um one
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
question this is an honest question
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
non-ratorical I don't know the answer to
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and that is I've never understood so
 
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
we have this um
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
um this narrative that people that are
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
on opiates or Vicodin or oxycodone or
 
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.770 align:start position:0%
on opiates or Vicodin or oxycodone or
whatever

01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
um for some reason they get taken off of
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
those drugs from their their legal
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
doctors and so then all of a sudden
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're turning to like heroin to kill
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
the pain or something and what I don't
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand is if there's a market for
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
oxycodone or Vicodin or whatever why
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
aren't they just buying those things on
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
the street instead of heroin so can you
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
just explain that to me I can totally
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
you buy what you can get and you buy
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
what you can afford heroin's cheap I
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
mean some people do that we've had
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
patients that were well maintained for
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
decades on opioids that for basically
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
because of bureaucratic pressure and
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
administrative pressure their doctors
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
took them off or you know I I can't
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
always judge but I've seen that we had a
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
patient that we followed through Vermont
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
that I was actually asked to testify on
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of his estate that committed
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
suicide because of that
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
um anyways you get what you can get and
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
oxycontin I'm not a street guy so I
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't know the cost of these things but
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
heroin is definitely cheaper than
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
Oxycontin and if you know if you're you
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
know this one patient got a was taken
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
off of
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
um 20 years of methadone sent to a
 
01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.290 align:start position:0%
um 20 years of methadone sent to a
um

01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know a detox center functionally six
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
day detox and then given nothing and he
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
shot himself a couple days later so we
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
that is what we see is that people are
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
detoxed they're abandoned
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriately they're detoxed and
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
appropriately and they basically are
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
desperate they're in withdrawal they
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
need something and so they will take
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
what they can get and in an Ideal World
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
yes they would get Oxycontin but we are
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
also seeing if we've had some wonderful
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
lectures from the DEA folks that work at
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
the southern border that know the
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
cartels very well and we know that
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
Oxycontin also has fentanyl in it now
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
the street stuff and you can also the
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
pills that you get look totally
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable for what you can get
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy so it's a huge public
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
health problem
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
um this is why this issue is really
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
important to me because we're talking
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
about a public health problem of an
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis with people
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
um you know that become addicted and
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
take it for reasons that would be
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
considered abuse but were also created a
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
simultaneous Public Health crisis that
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
we call the opioid Refugee crisis where
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
people that have been well maintained
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
for years or we talked earlier about
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
people at the end of life that can't get
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate management that are turning
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
to the street to get what they need or
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
we actually this sounds really morbid
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
and sick but through my organization we
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a thing called a suicide watch
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
because the problem is when you die most
 
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
people aren't kind enough to give us a
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
note to explain why they died
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
um somewhat jokingly very jokingly I
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
said that we should have passed a state
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
law that requires people to explain why
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
they commit suicide before they did it
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
because that's the only way we're going
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
to get the data but the reality is if
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
you die of an opioid overdose that's how
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
it gets reported it's not clear always
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
as to whether it was a suicide from
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate pain management or
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
whatever or like this person shot
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
himself if he hadn't left us in
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly detailed suicide note we
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
would have never known that was the
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
reason he killed himself and it would
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
have gone down as gun violence as
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to just desperation
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this can several day
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
discussions so representative Leon thank
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel for all of your
 
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
work on this both on this bill and in
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
the larger picture I know a lot of the
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill is in order to
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
align what we're doing with what
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is and I'm curious if you
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
know what impact there is on
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement codes if we change the
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
definition from misuse to abuse because
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
I I have some the copiers were down
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's some information coming down
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
that actually the CPT codes are based
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
off abuse so if we were to change the
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
definition to misuse we may have some
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
problems accessing
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
um accessing some of that insurance
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
coverage as well so I'm curious if you
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
know if you have any knowledge on that
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
the loveliest thing about my job is that
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
I sit in a cubby hole see patients and I
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that stuff so
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
my answer is no and it's a really good
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
question the amendment has arrived by
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your patience
 
01:35:52.080 --> 01:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your patience
remember

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
um just a thought about
 
01:36:16.450 --> 01:36:16.460 align:start position:0%
I I like to say intent of having
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
definitions for those terms and I don't
 
01:36:24.129 --> 01:36:24.139 align:start position:0%
have much problem with
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
misuse definition
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
but again there are harm reduction
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
definition includes some
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
very broad
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
fields of practice and my concern would
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
be like if we are opening
 
01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:43.310 align:start position:0%
be like if we are opening
uh

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:46.209 --> 01:36:46.219 align:start position:0%
uh to some
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
liabilities or expenditures that are not
 
01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.030 align:start position:0%
liabilities or expenditures that are not
required

01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
mixture yes representative point of
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
water yes since we're talking about a
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
different amendment should we withdraw
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
that one so we could continue on this
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
one okay representative could you
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion because it
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
addressed 16-18 I am more than happy to
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
withdraw that one representative
 
01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.850 align:start position:0%
withdraw that one representative
Missouri

01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
Missouri
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
and do you want to make a motion now on
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
1702 I would like a motion on autopaths
 
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.689 align:start position:0%
1702 I would like a motion on autopaths
for

01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:17.699 --> 01:37:19.930 align:start position:0%
for
um Amendment

01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:22.270 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
2023-1702

01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
2023-1702
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
h2sb239 can't represented Missouri do
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
you I'll be a second okay thank you
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this or any
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
Jewish address representative I promise
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
just say that the definition is
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
considerably less broad now that we have
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
did you want to address representative
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
palazzo's comment representative Nagel I
 
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
think was addressed to you yeah I I mean
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
we kind of addressed that last time
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
um it's a frustrating difficult thing in
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
the social sciences to come up with a
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
definition that covers every Everything
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts that I actually had
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
was to subdefine this
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and to include basically just what's
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
in the governor's commission now
 
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I got
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
spanking would be a polite way to say
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
the response I got to that one um so we
 
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:25.139 align:start position:0%
we talked at length basically to keep
 
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
the grant applications standard to keep
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
this the process somewhat Nimble for
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
changes to leave it in this manner so
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we kept it this way or
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
changed it to this
 
01:38:41.169 --> 01:38:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.050 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
chairman

01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
um part of my question is around the
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and my understanding is
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
that part of that is drug checking
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
um however we saw in the other body our
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill for drug checking was reduced only
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
to the fentanyl test strips and so I'm
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
kind of concerned that we may be
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
abandoning I think one of the most
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
important Frontline efforts in order for
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
a more nebulous set of goals and I'm
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually a bit concerned about what the
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
direction is when the other body is not
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
supporting the drug checking which on
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
the street can help prevent these
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
fentanyl overdoses and I'm not sure how
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
best to proceed given that conflict I
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any insight
 
01:39:22.199 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any insight
okay

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
this is great I'm suddenly an expert on
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
something I don't know a huge amount
 
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
something I don't know a huge amount
about

01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
I I would probably defer that question
 
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
to people on the commissions because I'm
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
not sure what our abilities are versus
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
what the Senate says
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
um I mean that language is in there that
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
those things can be funded so
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
um but I would I'm not smart enough to
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
know that so I would have to defer that
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
to somebody else
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.129 align:start position:0%
okay representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's not a question more of a
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
statement so um I was hoping that out of
 
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
statement so um I was hoping that out of
this

01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um search for a good definition of harm
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
reduction that we would have a list of
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
what harm reduction is not
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
um to be included in here because it is
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
a little less broad but it is still
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
quite broad
 
01:40:18.659 --> 01:40:19.490 align:start position:0%
quite broad
um

01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if I can support this
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it's 310 million dollars and I
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be very very
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
specific thank you
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I think that's a
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
very fair question and that was my
 
01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
original intent to do it that way
 
01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.129 align:start position:0%
original intent to do it that way
um

01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
the problem then becomes it becomes a
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
very long list and that's kind of why we
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
chose to not do it that way
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's the best answer I can give you
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
but it's a very good question
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
 
01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:54.530 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on this
amendment

01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
are we ready to vote awesome comment
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%

01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr

chairman um had we adopted any of the
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we spoke to last week I
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
so far we have adopted three amendments
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
the one that we just passed which was
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
1702 we've also passed uh 1581 H which
 
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:15.020 align:start position:0%
all of these start with 2023 by the way
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
and also 2023 1505.
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay do I have a motion of
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
Representative Leon
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you um I had actually some
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion um I have some of the
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
billing codes it's just a screenshot but
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna pass this around but one
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
of my big concerns is it has come to my
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
attention that there are no billing
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
codes for
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
um for alcohol misuse or for
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
psychoactive drug misuse and that the
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
psychoactive drug misuse abuse was cut
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
off on the when the screenshot was sent
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
around if we're looking at accessing
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
funding sources we need to be very very
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
careful not to cut off the reimbursement
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
under insurance coverage because if
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're aligning this with grant money but
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
then we take it out of alignment with
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
funding through through people's
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage that creates a
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
problem especially because we've looked
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
at other bills where we're trying to
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
expand that coverage for uh for
 
01:44:31.209 --> 01:44:31.219 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health for mental health
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
abuse I believe probably Falls separate
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
from mental health but I don't I
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
personally don't know exactly where all
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
those lines fall and I'm very very
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that by redefining as misuse
 
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
as opposed to abuse we may miss out on
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
frankly using people's benefits that
 
01:44:54.169 --> 01:44:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nagel
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
so the reason for changing the word from
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
abuse to misuse it's a just to create a
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
broader category but within that
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
category our
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know misuse abuse and um diversion
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
they're all subsets so you can still use
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
the term abuse when you're applying for
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
a grant or or whatever and you can still
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative Palmer
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question and is if you're
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
admitting a patient to the hospital and
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get reimbursement for
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
that it's up to the physician to pick
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis and therefore the code
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't be covered by this bill
 
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I would think that would be a
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
separate issue and and not one that
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
01:45:48.659 --> 01:45:53.390 align:start position:0%
another discussion
oh

01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
I thought the pass is amended I'm sorry
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's really to make a motion for auto
 
01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.050 align:start position:0%
it's really to make a motion for auto
pass

01:45:59.050 --> 01:45:59.060 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%

um before we call the role I would like
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%

okay emotions been made and seconded uh
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%

01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
so one of the reasons that I ran for the
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
legislature we all have our own reasons
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
why we're here and I think you already
 
01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
know why I ran but one of the things
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
that was very important to me was beyond
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain commissions and committees that
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
I can't be on as a public member one of
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
them was the opioid abatement commission
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
and um I am now on that and I was
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
honored to chair the last two sessions
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
of it which I think we got quite a bit
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
done and I was very proud of that
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
um granted that was not due to me it was
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
due to the hard work of some people that
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
some of whom I've known for a long
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
period of time who share one thing in
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
common they do a lot with very little
 
01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:39.050 align:start position:0%
common they do a lot with very little
um

01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a friend Bob twillman who I
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
think has actually testified before this
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
committee lives in Kansas and he used to
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
be the head of the Academy of
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
Integrative pain medicine but he refers
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
to an issue that we're dealing with in
 
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
our society that he refers to as the
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
three-headed monster which includes um
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
problems of
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
mental health problems which affects
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
about 51.5 million Americans chronic
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
pain which affects 66 million Americans
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
substance abuse abuse disorder which
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
affects about 33 million Americans and
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
and what he points out is there's a
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
substantial overlap between all these
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
issues what those things all have in
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
common in our culture and our society is
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
number one is their complex number two
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
is they're not curable number three the
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
goal of treatment is management not cure
 
01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:28.580 align:start position:0%
number four the management is
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary integrative number
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
five and six most importantly is that
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's limited reimbursement and
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
there's a limited labor source and what
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
we're finding out increasingly is the
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
labor force is increasingly burned out
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
and they're having more and more trouble
 
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
retaining people to do these important
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
jobs every election cycle that I've seen
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
for years we stress that we need to do
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
something about drug abuse mental health
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
problems and of course chronic pain
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
always gets left out but on the those
 
01:48:59.330 --> 01:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
two issues
 
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.290 align:start position:0%
two issues
um

01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
We've ran this bill by the folks in the
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and by the opioid
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
um Bateman commission and they both feel
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
that this bill is extremely important
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
for what they do
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's very important for the
 
01:49:15.850 --> 01:49:15.860 align:start position:0%
people that do great work we we get
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on a regular basis from groups
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
in the in our in our um community that
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
do amazing things with very little
 
01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and and they're looking at us as an
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to number one improve their
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
labor for us number two serve the people
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that they seek to serve um and I think
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
that that's really important to me
 
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:40.139 align:start position:0%
um so I think that this bill is our
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do what we've promised to
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
do for them
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
um this is not a simple bill it's very
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
complicated there's you know my first
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
read of it was misuse and a harm
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
reduction but it's much more complicated
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
that and I do accept understand that but
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
after going through it in detail I think
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
that it has a lot of value
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
um as is and as amended
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative Leon
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
has asked that we we have a brief caucus
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask uh let me be in
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
recess for 15 minutes and then we'll be
 
01:50:12.179 --> 01:50:14.209 align:start position:0%
recess for 15 minutes and then we'll be
back

01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm all right and assuming that those
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
who are caucusing are leaving because
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
there are more people who are not yeah
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna okay we won't do that to
 
01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna okay we won't do that to
you

01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that to any of you
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah we'll we'll uh we'll those of us
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
who are caucus and we'll be leaving the
 
01:50:31.380 --> 01:53:51.010 align:start position:0%
who are caucus and we'll be leaving the
room

01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
what I do I mean it's it's not Fox three
 
02:09:45.729 --> 02:09:45.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
wants to address that
 
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.750 align:start position:0%
wants to address that
um

02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:52.729 --> 02:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
I'm withdrawing my
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
um motion to Auto pass
 
02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
is amended on those three amendments and
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
the overall Bill 202 3 17
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh sixth Senate Bill 639
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
um with Amendment 1702 1581 and 1505. he
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
said he said what 639 you mean 239 or
 
02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah but I would love to
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
hear one representative Nagel was
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the forms okay
 
02:10:27.649 --> 02:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the big concerns that we've
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
had through this entire process was the
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction language
 
02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
the alternative motion is going to be
 
02:10:38.689 --> 02:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
retain it put together a committee or
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
subgroup to talk about harm reduction
 
02:10:42.649 --> 02:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
and then bring it back with language
 
02:10:42.659 --> 02:10:47.030 align:start position:0%
and then bring it back with language
that's

02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's not a politician I'm not a
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
politician I'm not a politician about
 
02:10:53.050 --> 02:10:53.060 align:start position:0%
that would be more amenable to everybody
 
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
by part that would have more bipartisan
 
02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
by part that would have more bipartisan
support

02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a vote on that to pass
 
02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:08.589 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a vote on that to pass
first

02:11:08.589 --> 02:11:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I support the
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill but I think that
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
it still needs more work in order to
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that the money is
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
going towards those people that we see
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
the most need in order to serve those
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain those who have been
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
kicked off of their doctor's
 
02:11:28.970 --> 02:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
prescriptions I don't want to kill this
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill I want to improve this bill so that
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
we can stand together and support this
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
with the entire house I'm not out here
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
to kill good programs I'm out here to
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
make the programs better and make them
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
be something that we all can be excited
 
02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
and proud of passing that is why I would
 
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
rather see this bill retained so that we
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
can make it address these challenges and
 
02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
direct that money more specifically to
 
02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
those areas that are often missed in
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
Grants and those that are overlooked in
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
turn in favor of those areas that are a
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
little bit easier to request in a little
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
bit easier to fund because it's a
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
cleaner and straightforward profit more
 
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
straightforward process even if it's not
 
02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
the one that gets the best value for the
 
02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
dollar interfacing people with those who
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
need the most services
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman before
 
02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:23.930 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman before
um

02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
before I assert the right to go forward
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
I would like to have a democratic caucus
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.490 --> 02:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
I think everyone's back now
 
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion on the floor is ought
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
to pass is amended on uh Senate bill
 
02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:26.810 align:start position:0%
to pass is amended on uh Senate bill
239.

02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I since we're ready to proceed
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative King yes thank you Mr
 
02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:31.849 align:start position:0%
representative King yes thank you Mr
chair

02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say a few things
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank
 
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Nagel for all the hard
 
02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
work he's put into this because
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
um I do think it's a very important
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
issue what what this bill is trying to
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
do and um the Lord knows it needs to get
 
02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
done and I have serious problems with
 
02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
the main Bill itself and I did vote for
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
your most recent Amendment because I do
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
think it takes a poor Bill and makes it
 
02:17:56.089 --> 02:17:56.099 align:start position:0%
better but even though I did vote for it
 
02:17:59.330 --> 02:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
I still have some qualms for example it
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
does it does Define misuse as a sub
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
using a substance that's not consistent
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
with legal guidelines and one of the
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
problems I have with that is let's just
 
02:18:09.599 --> 02:18:10.969 align:start position:0%
problems I have with that is let's just
say

02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
um somebody has
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
um every once in a blue moon really bad
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
back pain and they know that a half a
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
Vicodin could fix that they don't
 
02:18:20.450 --> 02:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a prescription but by
 
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
that definition that's drug misuse and
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
to me that's just drug use and that's
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
fine and I as as a Libertarian I don't
 
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
believe that we need to get a permission
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
slip from a doctor in order to
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
self-medicate and
 
02:18:36.770 --> 02:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
um also I was one of the few in the
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
house that voted this term to repeal the
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
the controlled substance act so nobody's
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to pin me as a drug Warrior and I
 
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
do believe that people have a right to
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
self-medicate and I don't like the War
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
on Drugs but the problem is I also don't
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
like subsidizing the alt I don't like
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
going in the opposite opposite extreme
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
so on one hand we criminalize drugs and
 
02:19:02.330 --> 02:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
we try and ruin people's lives for what
 
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
I would consider simple use of
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
medication and we're starting to finally
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank God realize the the Folly in that
 
02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we're running to the
 
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
opposite extreme which is subsidizing
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
bad behavior and we we're not just this
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
this legislation isn't just a shot in
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
the dark it's not like we're we're um
 
02:19:22.730 --> 02:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
Trailblazers in this we've got a lot of
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
other cities and states around the
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
country who have been doing the exact
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
same things that are in the main Bill
 
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
and they have had disastrous results I
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
cannot with in good conscience support
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
that so I again I want to appreciate
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel's hard work on this
 
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
is very important I think he made a bad
 
02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:42.599 align:start position:0%
Bill a little better but there's just
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
too many things in the bill itself that
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
are just they're just terrible they're
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
just terrible so it has to be worked on
 
02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
one way or the other and that's why I'm
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this thank
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
you a representative uh Leon thank you
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that overall addressing the
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
harms of drug use and being able to move
 
02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
away from misuse
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
um is absolutely important I think that
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
having a scheme where it requires these
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
substances to be illegal in order to
 
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
provide these Services as a problem I
 
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
think that we need to look at this
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensively including looking at the
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
legalization aspect because that reduces
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
some of those other risks and
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
stigmatization that's part of this I I
 
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
do think that we could get to something
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
that is a much better process that could
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
get everybody's support I I don't think
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
that this is the one that does it so I
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
will not be voting in support of this I
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
do believe that if if this moves forward
 
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
we need to look at that whole more
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
comprehensive one and bring back that
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill sorry house bill I
 
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
believe it was 287 that would actually
 
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
allow them to protect conduct drug
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
checking because right now as the the
 
02:20:51.889 --> 02:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
Senate is taking a position that they
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't actually do drug checking because
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
that would be drug paraphernalia and I
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a critical
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
aspect in order to add back to this
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
assuming it makes it to the floor
 
02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
so I'll be against it but hopefully we
 
02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
can see a better version emerge in the
 
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
coming week representative Weber
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
microphone I've been informed that
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
according to the clerk because I am now
 
02:21:15.650 --> 02:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
hanging out here in the air uh who's my
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
second I am now the moving party and the
 
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
question would be if anybody else would
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh you may take your pick
 
02:21:30.170 --> 02:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative matter of him we don't
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
hear from you that often so okay
 
02:21:32.220 --> 02:21:33.889 align:start position:0%
hear from you that often so okay
okay

02:21:33.889 --> 02:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:21:36.770 --> 02:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
so to clarify what the clerk is saying
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
the moving party would be what I am now
 
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
the moving party and representative
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you for clarifying that
 
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay other discussion on the motion
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the motion representative Cushman
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
just briefly I just want to reiterate
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
the my desire to retain this bill
 
02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:09.770 align:start position:0%
the my desire to retain this bill
is

02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:11.929 --> 02:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
based on wanting to fix what's wrong
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
with it I want to see this money go to
 
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
help the people that it needs to help
 
02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
and I want to see it go to them in a way
 
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
that um you know we have enough
 
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
direction for how it's going to be used
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
and I think that broadness is just
 
02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
what's leaving me out and I think it can
 
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
be fixed fairly easily if we all come
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
together and work on it thank you thank
 
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:32.270 align:start position:0%
together and work on it thank you thank
you

02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%

of the discussion
 
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call

02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
10 to 10. okay
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that will go to the
 
02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
you have to do
 
02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.389 align:start position:0%
you have to do
okay

02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leia
 
02:23:53.809 --> 02:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I move that we
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
retain Senate Bill 239
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay reserve a second
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri seconds would
 
02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion uh yes
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I think it's
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
very clear that our position is that we
 
02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
want to make this a bill that we can all
 
02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support this is not an
 
02:24:12.170 --> 02:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
effort to kill the bill or to delay it
 
02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
but to make sure that the funds are most
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
directed to those people that are most
 
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
in need so I hope that you'll support
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
the retained motion so that we can
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
actually make this a much stronger Bill
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you now the discussion
 
02:24:27.969 --> 02:24:27.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against the retained
 
02:24:32.929 --> 02:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
motion because uh this bill has been
 
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
worked on extensively by many many
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
people the harm is here now the need for
 
02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
reduction is here now and it is my
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
opinion that we need to pass this bill
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
now and get it in place and if there are
 
02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
things that need to be changed we can
 
02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
change them going forward but right now
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
is when we need to act and if we retain
 
02:25:01.849 --> 02:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
the bill there will be no action on our
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
part until January after which the bill
 
02:25:07.969 --> 02:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
will go to the Senate if it passes and
 
02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee of Passage and it
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
will be worked on by the Senate under
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
the normal calendar so it won't come out
 
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
until June of 2024 and I think that's
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so I I have to
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
say I I strongly oppose the bill as
 
02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
currently amended
 
02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
and and I I oppose it because I think
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
that the definition of harm reduction is
 
02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think that we have an opportunity
 
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
either to
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
bring this to the floor without
 
02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
bring this to the floor without
recommendation

02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:25:53.050 --> 02:25:53.060 align:start position:0%
is what I predict might happen here
 
02:25:56.809 --> 02:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
in which case I think it it has a
 
02:25:59.389 --> 02:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
potential to be defeated on the house
 
02:25:59.399 --> 02:26:00.849 align:start position:0%
potential to be defeated on the house
floor

02:26:00.849 --> 02:26:00.859 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
I believe that if we retain and if it's
 
02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:04.969 align:start position:0%
I believe that if we retain and if it's
defeated

02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at 20 25 before
 
02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:10.969 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at 20 25 before
we're

02:26:10.969 --> 02:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
able to to address it again
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
I guess I
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
I think the the other alternative is
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
that we come up with something that
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
potentially all of us can agree on and
 
02:26:27.889 --> 02:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
even get on consent I don't know but I
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
think that that we could potentially end
 
02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
up with something that that we have
 
02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
pretty broad consensus on
 
02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:34.790 align:start position:0%
pretty broad consensus on
so

02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm in in this case not
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
willing to support something and and
 
02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
sort of say we'll fix it later I think
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
the dangers are too too great there so I
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
will be voting to retain and I I really
 
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
want to urge you that if you care about
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I think that there are reasons
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
02:26:57.170 --> 02:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative King
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I too will be voting
 
02:27:01.250 --> 02:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe in rushed legislation
 
02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
that is dangerous and also
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about definitions here
 
02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:12.140 align:start position:0%
that are going to radically change
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
basically how we the government view uh
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
substance use abuse addiction
 
02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and and it could have radical change
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
for decades to come and yes technically
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
things can be changed but once the
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
wheels get moving the inertia can be
 
02:27:34.969 --> 02:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to stop or change
 
02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
course so I think that it behooves us to
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
slow down get bipartisan support on
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
something and not not just Ram through
 
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
it because I I agree there is serious
 
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
problems in this country with substance
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
addiction abuse misuse whatever you want
 
02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
to call it but and I have simple they
 
02:27:57.610 --> 02:27:57.620 align:start position:0%
too I'm very sympathetic towards that
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
but I also know that the government
 
02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
in its attempts to remedy a situation
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
can sometimes make problems worse and
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's my fear with this bill and I
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
think that we need all hands on deck to
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
really clean it up thank you thank you
 
02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
so you know all the discussion okay I'll
 
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call a roll motion is
 
02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
to retain Senate bill 239.
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%

02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
so representative Weber was our
 
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian so to speak that means a
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'm going to ask our
 
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
researcher just to check with us
 
02:29:32.809 --> 02:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
um you know retention has failed and not
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
to passes failed do we also have to vote
 
02:29:37.490 --> 02:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
itl because I don't think anybody here
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
really wants itl it was the other two
 
02:29:43.450 --> 02:29:43.460 align:start position:0%
options that were
 
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
I understand that so we have to vote
 
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
down itl as well well in that case I
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
will move itl and urge the body to vote
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
no okay is there a second
 
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon seconds any
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Weber do you
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
want to speak to your motion I just want
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
to make it very clear that I am going to
 
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
vote no on my own motion that's that's
 
02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
an unusual situation to find myself in
 
02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
but I I don't want this to be itl I
 
02:30:13.849 --> 02:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
don't and we've defeated retain so we've
 
02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
got to get through this so we can get it
 
02:30:17.450 --> 02:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
to the house floor okay thank you
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative pushman thank you Mr
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is a very difficult
 
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
situation to be in because I did want to
 
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
I work on this we could we do have the
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
option of
 
02:30:28.610 --> 02:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
um drafting a floor Amendment and trying
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
to get bipartisan support on that but
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
you know there's that's a a chance and
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know for sure that that's going
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
to work out
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately I believe that I am
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
um compelled by my principles and my
 
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
assessment of this bill to vote against
 
02:30:47.330 --> 02:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um to vote in favor of itl
 
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
Representative king
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
um what happens if
 
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
um what happens if itl motion fails what
 
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
do we do then
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative Weber once we vote itl
 
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
we've exhausted all of our options and
 
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the floor without
 
02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:03.710 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the floor without
recommendation

02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
and people can write whatever you know
 
02:31:09.469 --> 02:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
the first motion will be ought to pass
 
02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:12.140 align:start position:0%
right and people can write whatever
 
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
reports for and against that they wish
 
02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:17.510 align:start position:0%
reports for and against that they wish
to

02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay another discussion
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you again Mr
 
02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:23.150 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you again Mr
chair

02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be reluctantly voting
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes on itl
 
02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.530 align:start position:0%
yes on itl
um

02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
I think that potentially some floor
 
02:31:33.469 --> 02:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
amendments can be made but um
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah the there there's a lot of work
 
02:31:38.270 --> 02:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done and unfortunately
 
02:31:41.330 --> 02:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
the other two options were exhausted but
 
02:31:43.610 --> 02:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
um My Hope Is that
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
um something better can come of it thank
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
02:31:50.570 --> 02:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
leaning very heavily on the word in
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
expedient right now I believe that we
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
still do need to work on this um that
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
means that I will need to vote in favor
 
02:31:59.090 --> 02:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
and of inexperiod to legislate even
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
though I do want to see a solution to
 
02:32:02.809 --> 02:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
02:32:05.210 --> 02:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
um and I hope that we can find find some
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative mazura
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
yes I'm really disappointed that it's
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
come to this because I was fully in
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
favor of the retention in hopes of
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
making this better
 
02:32:20.809 --> 02:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and I don't like the itl motion at
 
02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
all but I have really no choice
 
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
um that we've that it's come to this
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
this result
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I don't like this and but I
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
will have to vote itl because we did not
 
02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative profile
 
02:32:42.650 --> 02:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
I I must admit I am very conflicted
 
02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:44.510 align:start position:0%
I I must admit I am very conflicted
because

02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
the intention behind this bill is a good
 
02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.790 align:start position:0%
the intention behind this bill is a good
intention

02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
intention
 
02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:56.210 align:start position:0%
intention
um

02:32:56.210 --> 02:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.330 --> 02:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
I I want I want to vote for a bill
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that achieves the the the ends that
 
02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to achieve uh
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
without the flaws that I see in it
 
02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:10.250 align:start position:0%
without the flaws that I see in it
um

02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:12.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
so I am going to vote against the itl
 
02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:15.770 align:start position:0%
so I am going to vote against the itl
motion

02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:19.309 align:start position:0%
motion
um

02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm still very very conflicted but I I
 
02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'll I'll be deciding over
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the next minute minute and a half but
 
02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:29.349 align:start position:0%
the next minute minute and a half but
um

02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm hesitant to to to let this
 
02:33:39.050 --> 02:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
die and then not be able to take it up
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
until 2025.
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that that is my concern I think it
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
can be fixed
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
I wish that we had retained it so that
 
02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
we could fix it
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna put my hope in a floor
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment and uh see if we can address
 
02:33:54.650 --> 02:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
it on the house floor representative
 
02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
it on the house floor representative
Merchant

02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will also be voting
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
against the itl I would encourage my
 
02:34:04.730 --> 02:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee to work with
 
02:34:06.650 --> 02:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders over the summer
 
02:34:08.809 --> 02:34:08.819 align:start position:0%
I think the benefits in The Spill are
 
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
exceed the potential downside so to
 
02:34:13.849 --> 02:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
address the downside that has been
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
raised here I would encourage us to get
 
02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
together over the summer with some of
 
02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders to draft a bill for
 
02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
next year thank you
 
02:34:25.370 --> 02:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none of our last account
 
02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
can you ask a question sure go ahead
 
02:34:34.610 --> 02:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative Nagle so if we vote to
 
02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
itl it's gone correct
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
if we leave it as is it goes to the
 
02:34:39.479 --> 02:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
if we leave it as is it goes to the
floor

02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
so no matter what we do it's going to
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
the floor right all right so it's going
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
to get a house vote no matter what we do
 
02:34:50.170 --> 02:34:50.180 align:start position:0%
all right at this point
 
02:34:52.610 --> 02:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead representative the only
 
02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
way it doesn't get a vote on the floor
 
02:34:56.210 --> 02:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
is if we vote to retain and that that
 
02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.849 --> 02:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
another discussion uh representative
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
McLean just a quick question following
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
up on our representative Merchant's
 
02:35:09.889 --> 02:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
comment is if this goes to the floor and
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's itl on the floor do we have an
 
02:35:16.969 --> 02:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
option still to draft for next year do
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
we have to wait until the next full
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
legislative Cycles it can't be brought
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
back up right it can't be brought back
 
02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
in its current form
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
um people may choose to take other
 
02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
approaches to the issue
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
although the Senate could potentially
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
bring it back could they and
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:41.389 --> 02:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
I the Senate can do whatever the Senate
 
02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
wants to do that's what I thought right
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
then it is a Senate Bill representative
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
land did you have a no okay
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
other uh representative Nagel I'm sorry
 
02:35:52.969 --> 02:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
to keep this is really important um so
 
02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
the bill will go to the house
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
assuming we don't what no matter what as
 
02:36:00.889 --> 02:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
amended yes and then if it passes the
 
02:36:00.899 --> 02:36:02.330 align:start position:0%
amended yes and then if it passes the
house

02:36:02.330 --> 02:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:36:05.090 --> 02:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
what's that representative whoever
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
it will go to the house without
 
02:36:10.730 --> 02:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
recommendation right so with the
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we put in there the
 
02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
people who and I I will again
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
turn to Ms dyer for
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
um clarification
 
02:36:24.889 --> 02:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
um I think it depends on how the report
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of ought to pass is written
 
02:36:32.210 --> 02:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that the
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
report would be ought to pass with
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment with these amendments
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm seeing a nodding head so I'm I'm
 
02:36:43.250 --> 02:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling a little less out on a limit
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
I want to know what's actually going to
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
go to the house and and
 
02:36:49.370 --> 02:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
the amendments are also going to have to
 
02:36:51.650 --> 02:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
be voted I think I don't know in this
 
02:36:55.389 --> 02:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
case whether the
 
02:36:58.250 --> 02:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
drafting office will consolidate those
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
or whether they will have us vote them
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
one by one but we'll have to see
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
but they'll have to be two reports I
 
02:37:07.610 --> 02:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
would I would imagine one for ikl and
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
one for
 
02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:10.429 align:start position:0%
one for
OTP

02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
02:37:13.610 --> 02:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
that would be correct I would imagine so
 
02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:15.349 align:start position:0%
that would be correct I would imagine so
anyway

02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:39:01.389 --> 02:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
um so at this point representative
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
exhausted all options on I believe so so
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
the motion will be no recommend well
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be no recommendation and go to the
 
02:39:10.690 --> 02:39:10.700 align:start position:0%
house floor in that fashion
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative play on um could I have
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
who's going to write the ought to pass
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
as amended report and get those numbers
 
02:39:20.530 --> 02:39:20.540 align:start position:0%
again for the green sheet please okay
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
the vote was fifteen five to Fifteen no
 
02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
um on the Dodge pass as amended was 10
 
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
10. we were out
 
02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:29.389 align:start position:0%
10. we were out
um

02:39:29.389 --> 02:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
because the ought to pass is amended as
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
the position I believe that um is ought
 
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
to pass is amended the position with
 
02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
which with
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
um you would like to take up the floor
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay and could I have those numbers oh
 
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
would you be writing that report or I
 
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
won't be writing that I will unless
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to but I would
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
invite contribution if anybody would
 
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
like to but I guess we have to get it to
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
you by first thing tomorrow morning as
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
well we need it tomorrow morning or this
 
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
afternoon by three
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to continue
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
I will I will do my best to get it
 
02:40:13.809 --> 02:40:13.819 align:start position:0%
that would be fabulous so it was 1581
 
02:40:16.730 --> 02:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
1505 and 1702.
 
02:40:19.730 --> 02:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
16 18. yeah they're going not 16.
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes no we can't vote on that one we've
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
already finished our voting but for the
 
02:40:33.530 --> 02:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
floor they have to consolidate if we had
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
passed all of these things we would have
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
sent this over to OLS and they would
 
02:40:40.969 --> 02:40:40.979 align:start position:0%
have drafted a new committee Amendment
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
that would be the majority committee
 
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it had passed so they're
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
just doing that it hasn't passed
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay and we need somebody to do Ito
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I'll write that
 
02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:56.650 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I'll write that
okay

02:40:56.650 --> 02:40:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
it must be in favor of Ito okay it must
 
02:41:04.730 --> 02:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
be must be why so it has to be like
 
02:41:06.969 --> 02:41:06.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay I think that concludes our our
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of Senate Bill 239 for
 
02:41:14.929 --> 02:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
this today
 
02:41:14.939 --> 02:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
this today
uh

02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine anything we've forgotten
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman thank you I
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
just have a clarifying question
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
so and it's for for you
 
02:41:30.770 --> 02:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um so it has to be itl we can't do an
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
opt to pass with a different Amendment
 
02:41:35.929 --> 02:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
as our recommendation for a Minority
 
02:41:35.939 --> 02:41:38.210 align:start position:0%
as our recommendation for a Minority
Report

02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
Report
 
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
you could I mean we do often have two
 
02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended reports that it
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
can't be reported out within without an
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
um so we would need to Perhaps Perhaps
 
02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh yes perhaps let's let's speak to
 
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
exactly what that'll be um as when we're
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
done here as to what that position will
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you um so I guess then is
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
when we're done if we could just caucus
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
with the Republicans after we finish our
 
02:42:03.359 --> 02:42:06.469 align:start position:0%
with the Republicans after we finish our
business

02:42:06.469 --> 02:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on Senate Bill 239
 
02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
before we move on
 
02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
saying none okay next up is Senate Bill
 
02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
240. I know the subcommittee that we
 
02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:18.410 align:start position:0%
240. I know the subcommittee that we
formed

02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
formed
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
um a meeting or two ago I think it was
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago did meet this morning
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon representative Weber
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchant meta in this
 
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
room prior to our executive session I'll
 
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
defer to representative um Leon on what
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
happened what transpired
 
02:42:38.809 --> 02:42:38.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman we met and
 
02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
discussed the three topics in the bill
 
02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
clinical care de-identified data and
 
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
clinical research and limited minimum
 
02:42:47.809 --> 02:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
debt necessary data for research the
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is focusing on the first
 
02:42:51.530 --> 02:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
two and we'll meet again on Tuesday May
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
16th at 10 30 a.m to continue our
 
02:42:55.849 --> 02:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
business and we greatly appreciate the
 
02:42:58.610 --> 02:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
contributions of um of those who came to
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
help us in that subcommittee hearing
 
02:43:03.010 --> 02:43:03.020 align:start position:0%
today so
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
one of the areas we will be looking to
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
is to see about potentially defining
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
what de-identified data is or are sorry
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
data multiple not singular
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
um so that that will be one of the areas
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we'll be looking towards
 
02:43:19.370 --> 02:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber did you want
 
02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
to add anything with representative
 
02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
Merchant did you want to add anything to
 
02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
that or no I I guess I would just add
 
02:43:27.170 --> 02:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
that what the approach that we are
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
taking is starting from the easiest
 
02:43:32.929 --> 02:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
issues which are uh the patient's
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
consent to their own treatment and then
 
02:43:37.849 --> 02:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
working outwards to the more difficult
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
areas of uh use for research because we
 
02:43:45.969 --> 02:43:45.979 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that a patient who
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
consented for their own treatment is is
 
02:43:52.490 --> 02:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
understanding what might be happening as
 
02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:54.349 align:start position:0%
understanding what might be happening as
well

02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay first a question what time is the
 
02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:58.610 align:start position:0%
okay first a question what time is the
um

02:43:58.610 --> 02:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
is the next work session is it 10 a.m or
 
02:44:11.809 --> 02:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
okay anything uh else on Senate bill
 
02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:15.950 align:start position:0%
okay anything uh else on Senate bill
240.

02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
240.
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
so that will be continued
 
02:44:18.359 --> 02:44:19.010 align:start position:0%
so that will be continued
um

02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not available on the 17th I don't
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
know if we can continue it out past then
 
02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
or when we would meet that'll be the
 
02:44:28.969 --> 02:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
only Bill well our deadline is the first
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
of June I believe right so there's
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
another there's another Wednesday there
 
02:44:36.530 --> 02:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
right so I've been thinking we would
 
02:44:38.330 --> 02:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
skip next week as far as any kind of
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
executive session for the committee
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and that would allow us if we were
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting close
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh next week in the subcommittee and
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to have one more meeting either
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
on the Tuesday of the the following week
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh I think it would be the 23rd
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
um or the Wednesday the 24th we could do
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
that before the committee met okay so
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
there will not be an executive session
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
next week
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
um there will be a house session as
 
02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
everyone knows but
 
02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
okay anything else about uh Senate bill
 
02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:11.929 align:start position:0%
okay anything else about uh Senate bill
240.

02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
240.
 
02:45:14.750 --> 02:45:14.760 align:start position:0%

02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
could I clarify that she's just moving
 
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
on to pass on the amendment not
 
02:45:37.070 --> 02:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with the amendment because
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't adopted the amendment yet is
 
02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
that right
 
02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's the correct procedure yes thank
 
02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.130 align:start position:0%
that's the correct procedure yes thank
you

02:45:43.130 --> 02:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
is there a second to representative
 
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:48.420 align:start position:0%

02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh Shapiro
 
02:45:53.210 --> 02:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
um if you want to distribute that yeah
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
if I I'm going to distribute a memo from
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate council which is really
 
02:46:02.330 --> 02:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
related to a different Amendment so I
 
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't know if we'll ever get to that
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
other Amendment but it is related to the
 
02:46:08.270 --> 02:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
question of whether the protection the
 
02:46:11.809 --> 02:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Protections in terms of the 90
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
10 ratio are in the Bill as is so I'm
 
02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
just handing this out for information
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
for future amendments if it comes up
 
02:46:28.730 --> 02:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
so I I will let this be distributed
 
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
before I speak over it and give
 
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
everybody a moment to take a look before
 
02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I will give the from outer space
 
02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
perspective on this this amendment
 
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
brings the bill into alignment with what
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
was passed in House Bill 2 and I will
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
hold any other conversation as you
 
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.540 --> 02:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:48:35.210 --> 02:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
see what people looking up as
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
should anybody have any comments
 
02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
should anybody have any comments
questions

02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:41.280 align:start position:0%

02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
were you ready for any discussion on
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill restates the same
 
02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
language passed in House Bill 2 on a
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan vote to extend the
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
sunset on Medicaid expansion in both the
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and the amended bill
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
this will sorry in this amendment sorry
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
it will reestablish the commission to
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate the effectiveness and future of
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire granted Advantage
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
Healthcare program and make all the
 
02:49:15.170 --> 02:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
changes to the taxes and fees that are
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the existing bill this
 
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
by amending this we would have the
 
02:49:22.969 --> 02:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
entire package that is in the budget on
 
02:49:26.510 --> 02:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and if we are able to
 
02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
adopt this
 
02:49:29.929 --> 02:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
I think that we'll be able to make sure
 
02:49:31.250 --> 02:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
that we're able to continue these
 
02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
covered Services we need to pass this
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill now there are people that need our
 
02:49:37.730 --> 02:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
help today and we can wait to address
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
the problems that exist with this bill
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the near future if we adopt this
 
02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.830 align:start position:0%
in the near future if we adopt this
amendment

02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
we discussed a lot of the things that
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed if this bill is going
 
02:49:49.010 --> 02:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
if this program is going to continue on
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
for any long period of time there are a
 
02:49:54.290 --> 02:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
lot of issues and there are quite a few
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we would need to address if we do
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
not adopt this amendment
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
but with this amendment we could place
 
02:50:03.050 --> 02:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
this bill on consent and affirm that we
 
02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
all believe that this program should go
 
02:50:07.250 --> 02:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
on and then this program will continue
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
it is in the budget it is a house
 
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
position and that will continue on with
 
02:50:12.889 --> 02:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
people with a pay grade greater than my
 
02:50:15.070 --> 02:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
own but with this we can join together
 
02:50:17.809 --> 02:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
and agree that yes this program must
 
02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
continue and we can move out of here
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
today with a good positive vote
 
02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and so I would I'm asking for your
 
02:50:27.410 --> 02:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment so that we can
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
join together and say yes let's keep
 
02:50:32.570 --> 02:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
providing this necessary services
 
02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:35.370 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:50:35.370 --> 02:50:37.130 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
[Music]

02:50:37.130 --> 02:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say that house bill 2
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
being the state budget is a gigantic
 
02:50:43.250 --> 02:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
document and it contains many many
 
02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:45.110 align:start position:0%
document and it contains many many
compromises

02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
compromises
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
and the compromise that many of us who
 
02:50:51.230 --> 02:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
voted for it made was on Medicaid
 
02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.429 align:start position:0%
voted for it made was on Medicaid
expansion

02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh we were told we those of us who were
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing on Senate Bill 263
 
02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
heard everybody except one person
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of making the program
 
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.370 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of making the program
permanent

02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
those of us who are in favor of making
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
the program permanent and who understand
 
02:51:14.210 --> 02:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
that it is already working and proven
 
02:51:17.290 --> 02:51:17.300 align:start position:0%
and that extending for two years
 
02:51:21.730 --> 02:51:21.740 align:start position:0%
really hampers any kind of discussion
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
about how the program is put out to bid
 
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
and how savings are made and all the
 
02:51:33.370 --> 02:51:33.380 align:start position:0%
rest of that uh simply come to a halt
 
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
and uh it's not something we can sustain
 
02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
on a two-year by two year basis and for
 
02:51:43.610 --> 02:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
all of the people who came and said they
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
wanted this extended because of the
 
02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
changes in their lives and that we from
 
02:51:52.849 --> 02:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association
 
02:51:55.849 --> 02:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
through many many many many many other
 
02:51:55.859 --> 02:51:57.130 align:start position:0%
through many many many many many other
organizations

02:51:57.130 --> 02:51:57.140 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
across a broad spectrum of our
 
02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:02.050 align:start position:0%
across a broad spectrum of our
constituencies

02:52:02.050 --> 02:52:02.060 align:start position:0%
constituencies
 
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
they ask that it be made permanent and I
 
02:52:07.969 --> 02:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
would like the chance to devote on it
 
02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
being made permanent so I'm going to
 
02:52:12.050 --> 02:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
vote against this amendment
 
02:52:15.290 --> 02:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative Leon um
 
02:52:17.690 --> 02:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you just as a point of order I
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
hope that the statement about who is
 
02:52:22.250 --> 02:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
present here isn't anything about the
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
fact that I had to deal with the death
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
in the family I watched all of the
 
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
hearings and I was attending to a death
 
02:52:28.849 --> 02:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
in the family
 
02:52:31.849 --> 02:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
in my apologies and and my sorrow for
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
your loss thank you
 
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
I I think we all you know for the sake
 
02:52:48.010 --> 02:52:48.020 align:start position:0%
of the 33 people who did testify need to
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
renew the Medicaid expansion you know
 
02:52:54.050 --> 02:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
because to not do so would be to
 
02:52:57.230 --> 02:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
basically cut these people off
 
02:53:01.010 --> 02:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
um so I totally agree that we need to
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
renew the problem is in making it
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
permanent and so when we went through
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
the orientation I pulled up the the
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid report from February 2nd 2023
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I just kind of looked at those
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
numbers so when Medicaid expansion came
 
02:53:21.769 --> 02:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
in in 2024 we had a hundred and thirty
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
thousand people in the state on Medicaid
 
02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
extent Medicaid standard Medicaid we
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
added 40 000 to the rolls for so the
 
02:53:32.090 --> 02:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
full complement was a hundred and
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand in the intervening nine
 
02:53:35.279 --> 02:53:36.230 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand in the intervening nine
years

02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:53:39.410 --> 02:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
the standard Medicaid has grown from a
 
02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty thousand to a hundred
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
and forty thousand that's about uh seven
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
percent increase now in a perfect one
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it go down but I could
 
02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
understand how it might go up seven
 
02:53:50.279 --> 02:53:51.889 align:start position:0%
understand how it might go up seven
percent

02:53:51.889 --> 02:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid expansion complement on the
 
02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
other hand has gone from forty thousand
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
to ninety thousand that is a two hundred
 
02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
and twenty five percent increase
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
and when I look at the numbers what's
 
02:54:07.790 --> 02:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
that just an initial Spike maybe because
 
02:54:09.290 --> 02:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
people were getting acclimated the
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
program no that that's been a sustained
 
02:54:12.950 --> 02:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
rate throughout
 
02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
so it is my belief that that is
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
something that is going to continue to
 
02:54:22.010 --> 02:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
grow and I think it puts us
 
02:54:24.769 --> 02:54:24.779 align:start position:0%
it puts me questioning the
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability of what that's going to
 
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
do to to our hospitals I don't know what
 
02:54:33.170 --> 02:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
all the drivers are for that I gotta be
 
02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
honest my gut is telling me
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
um that the exchanges are
 
02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:39.830 align:start position:0%
um that the exchanges are
underperforming

02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
underperforming
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but I don't really know what that is
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
I do have anecdotal you know evidence
 
02:54:47.150 --> 02:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
from talking to people where many people
 
02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
for example I know one woman who she
 
02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:51.710 align:start position:0%
for example I know one woman who she
retired

02:54:51.710 --> 02:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
retired
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
and she's not yet eligible for Medicare
 
02:54:56.570 --> 02:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
so she says I'm going to go and I'm
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to go on the exchanges well what
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
happened is because her declared income
 
02:55:03.889 --> 02:55:03.899 align:start position:0%
is so low the only option that she had
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
available was to go into Medicaid
 
02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
expansion so I don't know what all the
 
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
underlying causes are but I don't know
 
02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
that we in this committee truly
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
understand that but the bottom line is
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that what this is
 
02:55:20.210 --> 02:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
doing is this is making up for the
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care I really believe at
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
this point we are replacing
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care with poorly
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
compensated care and the poorly
 
02:55:33.410 --> 02:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
compensated care portion is growing and
 
02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
I think that really is going to create a
 
02:55:38.269 --> 02:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
sustainability problem down the road and
 
02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
we could look at 10 years from now our
 
02:55:45.889 --> 02:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
small hospitals being in real trouble so
 
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
the way I see this renewal this renewal
 
02:55:51.349 --> 02:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be a tourniquet it's
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
something thing that has to stop the
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
bleeding but we it cannot be the final
 
02:55:59.450 --> 02:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
fix we have to come back we have to
 
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
revisit and we have to understand how
 
02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
all these pieces go together and I don't
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
think we do it this time well enough to
 
02:56:08.809 --> 02:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
say that we are going to do a permanent
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of Medicaid expansion so
 
02:56:13.490 --> 02:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
I like this approach uh thank you Mr
 
02:56:16.450 --> 02:56:16.460 align:start position:0%
chair representative Shapiro
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting against this
 
02:56:23.450 --> 02:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
amendment and I just want to give a
 
02:56:24.769 --> 02:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
little bit of information I think we
 
02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
could get a lot of information because
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people from Department
 
02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services here but I
 
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we really need it
 
02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:34.250 align:start position:0%
don't think we really need it
um

02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
a great portion of that expansion of
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid is due to the National
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency which
 
02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:43.510 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency which
um

02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:46.490 --> 02:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
where wherein there was Federal rules
 
02:56:49.309 --> 02:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid could not expire
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:56:53.690 --> 02:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
um so the numbers went up by tens of
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of people because of a federal
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
rule that said we could not have people
 
02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
leave Medicaid that's for standard
 
02:57:04.849 --> 02:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and expanded Medicaid and I
 
02:57:04.859 --> 02:57:05.570 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and expanded Medicaid and I
think

02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
um as you might have heard in the news
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
the Department of Human Health and Human
 
02:57:13.490 --> 02:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
Services is doing their best to reach
 
02:57:15.230 --> 02:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
out to people so people who are still
 
02:57:17.929 --> 02:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
eligible can maintain their eligibility
 
02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
and people who are no longer eligible
 
02:57:22.570 --> 02:57:22.580 align:start position:0%
because they either
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
got employment or got better employment
 
02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
who or were laid off and went back to
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
their jobs will be removed for the
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rolls and that is happening as
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
we speak and the expectation is that the
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
number for Medicaid expansion will go
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
back down to about 50 000 people and I
 
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the financial note about
 
02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:46.670 align:start position:0%
you know the the financial note about
supporting

02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:48.349 align:start position:0%
supporting
um

02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion was done with in
 
02:57:53.090 --> 02:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
consideration of the fact that the
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
number will be much lower so I do think
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
we I do think we have information about
 
02:58:00.290 --> 02:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
that and I think we could get into a I'm
 
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
sure we could get into a long debate
 
02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
about this but
 
02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:05.809 align:start position:0%
about this but
um

02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:07.969 --> 02:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's necessary so I
 
02:58:09.530 --> 02:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
will be voting against
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
um this amendment thank you
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Wayan um thank you Mr
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would actually like to
 
02:58:18.769 --> 02:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
commend the department for their and Mr
 
02:58:20.690 --> 02:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
Lipman if he's here for their efforts in
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we're getting
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
through this backlog of people
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it was my understanding that we'll be
 
02:58:29.389 --> 02:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
coming down to 65 000 from the which is
 
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
greatly down from the peak and I know
 
02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the plan that we've done in New
 
02:58:34.370 --> 02:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is better than what a lot of
 
02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
states are doing so thank you thank you
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you but that increased from 40 to
 
02:58:41.690 --> 02:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
65 is Meaningful and that's why it's so
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
important to continue this program and
 
02:58:45.710 --> 02:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
not let it get caught in limbo and then
 
02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
to have time moving forward but I think
 
02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think we've all already said just
 
02:58:50.269 --> 02:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
about everything that we can say about
 
02:58:51.469 --> 02:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:58:54.290 --> 02:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm representative Missouri
 
02:58:56.210 --> 02:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:58:58.190 --> 02:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm coming at this from a freshman
 
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
late legislator Viewpoint and that I'm
 
02:59:04.910 --> 02:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
very hesitant to make any kind of
 
02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
program permanent because from my
 
02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:09.290 align:start position:0%
program permanent because from my
viewpoint

02:59:09.290 --> 02:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
that makes it that withdraws some
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency to the
 
02:59:17.690 --> 02:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
process of it and so I did vote on it
 
02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
for hb2 because that would in my from
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
what I saw was in that making something
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
permanent is not that and I am not in
 
02:59:30.410 --> 02:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
favor of stopping Medicaid that's not
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
what this is this is let's Place some
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
markers on it so that we can keep
 
02:59:40.250 --> 02:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
looking at it making it better making
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure things are happening that are
 
02:59:43.670 --> 02:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be happening just sending it
 
02:59:48.550 --> 02:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
into Oblivion forever is not that so
 
02:59:51.650 --> 02:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
I you know I've I've seen the
 
02:59:54.349 --> 02:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
exasperated looks around the room but I
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
see this as opportunity
 
02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
um not you know the amendments are only
 
03:00:01.510 --> 03:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
only brought forth to make this better
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
and so I see us
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
putting some sort of kind of marker on
 
03:00:11.090 --> 03:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
this as an opportunity as legislators to
 
03:00:14.450 --> 03:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
do what we were voted in to do and not
 
03:00:17.570 --> 03:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
just send something into Forever Without
 
03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
revisiting it again so I feel really
 
03:00:23.450 --> 03:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
strongly about that so that's why I am
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment because I
 
03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
want accountability and people say oh
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
well don't worry about it it's federal
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
dollars that will pay for it federal
 
03:00:36.050 --> 03:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
dollars are our tax dollars and they are
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
the people who voted for us it's their
 
03:00:42.050 --> 03:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
tax dollars too and so we owe it to them
 
03:00:46.490 --> 03:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
to keep this at the Forefront of the
 
03:00:48.170 --> 03:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
very important thing that we keep paying
 
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
attention to on a regular basis not
 
03:00:54.530 --> 03:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
sending it into Forever Without that so
 
03:00:57.050 --> 03:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's my viewpoint thank you of the
 
03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:58.490 align:start position:0%
that's my viewpoint thank you of the
discussion

03:00:58.490 --> 03:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative farmer
 
03:01:03.889 --> 03:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
So speaking of tax dollars uh from the
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
original testimony commissioner lippman
 
03:01:08.210 --> 03:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
had said that there would be issues with
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
a two-year contract
 
03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
trying to get contracts with the
 
03:01:14.090 --> 03:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
insurers for two years and that also
 
03:01:16.130 --> 03:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
might be more expensive and so my
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
concern would be if you set a two-year
 
03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
limit are we then going to actually be
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
spending more money than we need to
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
03:01:32.090 --> 03:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
so you know the discussion I'll ask the
 
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the roll motion is ought
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%

03:01:43.130 --> 03:01:43.140 align:start position:0%

I think we've talked this to death and I
 
03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
think we probably should go for the next
 
03:02:49.969 --> 03:02:49.979 align:start position:0%

03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay you're moving Senate Bill 265 to
 
03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:53.330 align:start position:0%
okay you're moving Senate Bill 265 to
pass

03:02:53.330 --> 03:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
pass

03:03:06.650 --> 03:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was Amendment drafted by myself and
 
03:03:14.090 --> 03:03:14.100 align:start position:0%

do we have a second on the amendment
 
03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
I realize we're not quite ready to
 
03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%

okay that's all right
 
03:04:28.610 --> 03:04:28.620 align:start position:0%

and she did she does and she declined
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%

03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you
 
03:04:49.490 --> 03:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
I during the testimony
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and Senator Bradley was here I
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
brought up the issue about the growing
 
03:04:56.090 --> 03:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
cost of pharmaceuticals Within
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
the healthcare system in general
 
03:05:00.349 --> 03:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
including Medicaid and my recommendation
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
at that point in time was to be sure we
 
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
had a licensed pharmacist on the
 
03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission to help deal with the rising
 
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
costs of pharmaceutical cares I did work
 
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
with representative Cushman
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
um she's not willing to Second this uh
 
03:05:13.490 --> 03:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
maybe we could go back and come up with
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
another amendment to strike the Joshua
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
Violet Center that was added as a
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
courtesy to representative from Cushman
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but obviously just wanted to support
 
03:05:24.410 --> 03:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment we could withdraw that as
 
03:05:26.269 --> 03:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
well and I could go back upstairs and
 
03:05:27.769 --> 03:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
quickly get another amendment to strike
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
that we also wanted to hear which
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley agreed to was receiving
 
03:05:35.330 --> 03:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
public input from the issues discussed
 
03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
by the commission if that's something
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
also that
 
03:05:41.090 --> 03:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
president of Cushman wanted to add are
 
03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
you glad to go upstairs quickly and get
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
this redrafted so all we have to do is
 
03:05:46.610 --> 03:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
add the licensed pharmacist to the to
 
03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
so people want to just narrow it down to
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
that I'll be more than glad to go
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
upstairs quickly and get that redirected
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
now the discussion by representative
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
Cushman thank you and I apologize
 
03:06:00.769 --> 03:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant it's no slight
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
against you but after finding out more
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
about RSA 14 and the the law that
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
dictates that these commissions are
 
03:06:12.650 --> 03:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a majority legislators
 
03:06:15.530 --> 03:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I I am not comfortable
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not comfortable with the commission
 
03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think that adding these
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
two positions is going to have much
 
03:06:26.450 --> 03:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
meaningful impact
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
um I think that it should be legislators
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
image already the way that the statute
 
03:06:32.929 --> 03:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
has it now and that we shouldn't be
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
accept exempting it from that and
 
03:06:37.370 --> 03:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
especially the way that this particular
 
03:06:39.769 --> 03:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
commission has evolved since it started
 
03:06:42.370 --> 03:06:42.380 align:start position:0%
where initially it was
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
only legislators who had a voting power
 
03:06:49.490 --> 03:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
and then gradually over time it has
 
03:06:52.490 --> 03:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
become that a lot of the
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
other people on the commission have
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
voting power and I just can't support it
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
at all so
 
03:07:02.809 --> 03:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I guess the question to the
 
03:07:04.610 --> 03:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
chair and to the committee
 
03:07:07.250 --> 03:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
how quick I can get this to be redrafted
 
03:07:09.710 --> 03:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
so all we have is number 16. we delete
 
03:07:12.849 --> 03:07:12.859 align:start position:0%
17 and number nine
 
03:07:15.530 --> 03:07:15.540 align:start position:0%

03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
chairman if we're going to start working
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
on fixing the program I literally have a
 
03:07:25.370 --> 03:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
file box sitting right here at my knees
 
03:07:27.889 --> 03:07:27.899 align:start position:0%
of all of the ways to fix this I would
 
03:07:29.690 --> 03:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
just like to find a way for us to say
 
03:07:31.730 --> 03:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
that we have a position and to move
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
forward so we don't have to spend our
 
03:07:36.410 --> 03:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
time now and then next week trying to
 
03:07:43.210 --> 03:07:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
okay so this this amendment will not be
 
03:07:46.439 --> 03:07:48.410 align:start position:0%
okay so this this amendment will not be
considered

03:07:48.410 --> 03:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:07:48.420 --> 03:07:49.070 align:start position:0%
considered
um

03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:51.410 --> 03:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
do I have another motion on the on
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.410 --> 03:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
anybody wish to make a motion
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I I move or to
 
03:08:04.090 --> 03:08:04.100 align:start position:0%
pass on Senate bill Tuesday Senate Bill
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
a representative Shapiro do you want to
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion or
 
03:08:24.530 --> 03:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.809 --> 03:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
we have given a lot of attention to this
 
03:08:29.450 --> 03:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
including in a public hearing we've had
 
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
a lot of expert testimony we clearly
 
03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
have a lot of disagreement both about
 
03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
the details of the program and I think
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
about the philosophy of the program so I
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
I don't think um
 
03:08:46.969 --> 03:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
as evident by the discussion
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
today last week the week before I don't
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna necessarily reach
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
consensus but I think that this is an
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
important program it's a program where
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's been an outpouring of support
 
03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
from our constituents and I think we
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
should pass it permanently so I hope you
 
03:09:05.570 --> 03:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
will vote
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass

we all agree that this program should be
 
03:11:02.809 --> 03:11:02.819 align:start position:0%
continued should continue the question
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
is how it continues and with two years
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
we buy time to be able to deal with
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
those issues as opposed to dealing with
 
03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
them next week
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%

03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
is but the subcommittee needs more time
 
03:14:37.730 --> 03:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
to work on 240. Senate Bill 240. uh we
 
03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
do have 12 retained bills right now I I
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
am looking for people who and
 
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you for
 
03:14:46.849 --> 03:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
getting back to me representative Canon
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so yeah please give
 
03:14:58.309 --> 03:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
me your feedback as to which uh one of
 
03:14:59.929 --> 03:14:59.939 align:start position:0%
the retained bills you'd like to help on
 
03:15:02.750 --> 03:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
if if any uh okay if we need to address
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
those you know by I think November 18th
 
03:15:09.050 --> 03:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's my memory serves and they'll
 
03:15:10.610 --> 03:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
obviously ultimately be considered by
 
03:15:12.610 --> 03:15:12.620 align:start position:0%
the Full House in January but
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
it would be great for us to get started
 
03:15:18.050 --> 03:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
on on them in June so that we can get a
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
head start exactly and and how's
 
03:15:23.090 --> 03:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
leaderships encourage that too so to
 
03:15:25.070 --> 03:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
start working on in June if we can so
 
03:15:27.469 --> 03:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri I have a point
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
of clarity
 
03:15:30.410 --> 03:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
um just for myself as a freshman
 
03:15:33.290 --> 03:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
legislator how this works is to us does
 
03:15:35.929 --> 03:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
a committee or subcommittee get plate
 
03:15:38.510 --> 03:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
formed over these retention bills
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
these retained Wells and again we've
 
03:15:42.650 --> 03:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
debated that representative Weber I I
 
03:15:45.170 --> 03:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
know it's it's probably easier to not do
 
03:15:47.690 --> 03:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
a formal subcommittee is that
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
we've debated this a lot and people do
 
03:15:52.010 --> 03:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
them in many different ways we've I I
 
03:15:54.650 --> 03:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
have sat on committees where the whole
 
03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee sat and dealt with every
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
single retained Bill and and bills get
 
03:16:01.490 --> 03:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
retained for all kinds of different
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
reasons some of them are just to wait
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
and see if something's going to happen
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
and if it does you're good others are
 
03:16:09.410 --> 03:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
really naughty things that we've
 
03:16:11.769 --> 03:16:11.779 align:start position:0%
retained that need a lot of work
 
03:16:15.769 --> 03:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
my preference is to refer them to an
 
03:16:19.070 --> 03:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
official subcommittee which then notices
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
their hearings because we're not under
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
the same kind of time pressures we know
 
03:16:26.090 --> 03:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
we've got till November my preference
 
03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
would be for an official subcommittee to
 
03:16:31.250 --> 03:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
be made named by the chair and those
 
03:16:33.410 --> 03:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittees maybe not on every Bill
 
03:16:35.809 --> 03:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
some of them might be simpler but the
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
the weightier ones and and have those
 
03:16:43.730 --> 03:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
done uh with the official proceedings
 
03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
and 91a in place so that the people who
 
03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:48.190 align:start position:0%
and 91a in place so that the people who
are

03:16:48.190 --> 03:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
interested in that subject have notice
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
and an ability to come and and either
 
03:16:58.010 --> 03:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
watch our subcommittees proceed or
 
03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
participate in them at the pleasure of
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee we could also just have
 
03:17:05.809 --> 03:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
people as we did during covid get
 
03:17:08.269 --> 03:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
together in little uh groups smaller
 
03:17:10.730 --> 03:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
than a quorum of the committee and work
 
03:17:12.530 --> 03:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
on them but I think that that's the
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
least effective way and it's certainly
 
03:17:17.950 --> 03:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
the least transparent way
 
03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I I prefer to do something that was
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
formalized so that the members of the
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
public were interested can come and if
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
then if they're aggrieved at the end at
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
least we can say we made an effort to
 
03:17:31.690 --> 03:17:31.700 align:start position:0%
include everybody
 
03:17:35.450 --> 03:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative so uh apologies uh also
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
further clarification so would that be
 
03:17:40.190 --> 03:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
one committee or the Committees for each
 
03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
one committee or the Committees for each
one

03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:17:43.130 --> 03:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
um it would take more than one
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee definitely so generally
 
03:17:47.330 --> 03:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
speaking there would be one for each
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
subject right and and sometimes when
 
03:17:52.849 --> 03:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
there are when there is one or more
 
03:17:55.250 --> 03:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
bills on the same broad subject matter
 
03:17:58.330 --> 03:17:58.340 align:start position:0%
the chair might uh
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
Clump the ones that are all dealing with
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing if we'd retained for
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
example all three of the systems of care
 
03:18:10.849 --> 03:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
bills we could you know it would have
 
03:18:12.230 --> 03:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
made sense to Clump all of those
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
together but we didn't retain all three
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
of them so we only have one
 
03:18:19.130 --> 03:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
my thought might be before I recognize
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is seeing who's
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
interested in what subject matters and
 
03:18:24.590 --> 03:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
then see how they'd you know get some
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
input from them as to how they'd like to
 
03:18:26.399 --> 03:18:27.830 align:start position:0%
input from them as to how they'd like to
proceed

03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense representative Leon
 
03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I actually
 
03:18:33.530 --> 03:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
received a scheduling notice for another
 
03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
committee about the retained bills and
 
03:18:38.210 --> 03:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
so if we discuss all of the we we try
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
and figure out our path forward with
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
who's interested we may be able to
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
discuss that and then speak to those
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees publicly when we do come
 
03:18:47.389 --> 03:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
back for Senate Bill 240 and then to
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
sort of assign those subcommittees and
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
whatnot and figure out our plans forward
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
for at least those which we know so that
 
03:18:56.090 --> 03:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
may be one path that makes more use of
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
coming back for what will be a short
 
03:18:59.330 --> 03:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
executive session once we finally
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
understand uh Senate Bill 240 sure and
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
then by that time more people have had a
 
03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
chance to think about what areas they
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
want to work on representative uh
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
wherever and I would just caution people
 
03:19:12.769 --> 03:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
to check with Ms Dyer about what we can
 
03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
and can't discuss at that meeting unless
 
03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's unless the bills are noticed
 
03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:18.050 align:start position:0%
it's unless the bills are noticed
specifically

03:19:18.050 --> 03:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:19:20.410 --> 03:19:20.420 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
03:19:22.969 --> 03:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
she and I will discuss that after the
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
government today
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
any other business come before the
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that is appropriate
 
03:19:33.769 --> 03:19:33.779 align:start position:0%
well thank you all very much uh I think
 
03:19:34.969 --> 03:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
we're getting out of here earlier than
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
most of us anticipated which usually is
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
a good thing
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I'll see you uh I'll
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
see you at the house session next week
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
we stand adjourned
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and Republicans I wanted to meet with
