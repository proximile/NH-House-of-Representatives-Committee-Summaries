are our values focused
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%

time of need
 
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
he was a true servant of Christ
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
I enjoyed talking about God with Gary he
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
always explained aspects of God's nature
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
in simple terms that were so encouraging
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
and inspiring of deeper meditation
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
Gary was down to earth as a young man he
 
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:17.339 align:start position:0%
had dealt with vices as an older man he
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
didn't pretend to be anything other than
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
who he was
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
and he helped others with their vices
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
he had a certain relaxed demeanor that
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
made it easy to talk to him
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
he had a joy for life
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
that combined with a sense of humor
 
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.530 align:start position:0%
that combined with a sense of humor
unrivaled

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
unrivaled
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
are two key traits that made Gary so
 
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.490 align:start position:0%
are two key traits that made Gary so
likable

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
likable
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
Gary was a great mentor
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
and a great friend I jokingly called him
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
my adopted Grandpa and he said that that
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
was awesome because it was a compliment
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
and an insult at the same time
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Gary Hopper served our
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
state as a representative from 2008 to
 
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.230 align:start position:0%
state as a representative from 2008 to
2022.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's seven terms during that time he
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
represented the towns of Goffstown wear
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
and Deering
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
issues of particular importance to Gary
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
were the right to life the right to bear
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
arms and stopping human trafficking
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper served as the
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
chair of Fish and Game
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
and on the Judiciary and criminal
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
justice committees in this chamber he
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
had many friends on both sides of the
 
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.090 align:start position:0%
had many friends on both sides of the
aisle

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
in 2005 when the U.S Supreme Court ruled
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
that Suzette kilo's house could be taken
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
by eminent domain not for schools
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
hospitals or highways but for tax
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
reasons there was outrage
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
one of the justices lived in Ware at the
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
time and under Gary's leadership the
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
locals banded together to take the
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
Justice's house by imminent domain
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
the town needed a new hotel that would
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
bring tax revenue and that location was
 
00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:48.769 align:start position:0%
bring tax revenue and that location was
perfect

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
news media from all over the world
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
covered the bid to take the Justice's
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
house in the end the bid was
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful but because of Gary's work
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
the world wouldn't soon forget what
 
00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.629 align:start position:0%
the world wouldn't soon forget what
happened

00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
afterward 44 State legislatures
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire's changed their
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
constitutions in various ways in an
 
00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:08.339 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure that this never
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
happens to a private citizen ever again
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
Gary certainly left a mark
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
everybody knew him for whistling the
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy theme song
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
many remember his speech about
 
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
many remember his speech about
paratroopers

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
paratroopers
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
that was before my time here
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
I remember how at the Bedford Sportsplex
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
he would always give me his granola part
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
granola bars because he was allergic to
 
00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:30.290 align:start position:0%
granola bars because he was allergic to
nuts

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
nuts
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
he and The Honorable Susan dilemmis
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
would sing the national anthem together
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
Along with whoever was performing it and
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
it always made me smile
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
he often would ask to carpool with me
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
because we would get out late and his
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
eyes weren't so great
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
driving at night was difficult for him I
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
obliged but I never told him that my
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
eyes aren't so great either
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
one time I saw Gary's wife Brenda
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
driving in Goffstown and I pulled over
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
to say hi
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
Gary messaged me later that day and said
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
you're stalking my wife
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
I told them I saw her at Rite Aid and I
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
pulled over to say hi he said this is
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
when Gary became sick I was worried he
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
texted me telling me that his cancer was
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
too intertwined with multiple organs and
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
surgery was not an option
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm opting for Kamikaze nanoparticles he
 
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
I'm opting for Kamikaze nanoparticles he
said

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
I later understood this to mean that he
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
was having targeted cancer therapy
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
at one point our friend was told by
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
doctors that he only had two months to
 
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
doctors that he only had two months to
live

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
by the grace of God his cancer markers
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
decreased and he was given more time to
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
be with his family
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
he felt a little better and he returned
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
to rock paper hand grenades temporarily
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
a show that he co-hosted since 2011 with
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh with a couple of co-hosts and most
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
recently Joshua Solomon
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
he joined some Republicans in where for
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
sign waving during campaign season and
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
made appearances at the polls
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
he cast his final vote in the first
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
election in 14 years that didn't feature
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
his name on the general ballot
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
several months later on February 12 2023
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
God finally ended Gary's suffering and
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
called him home to the kingdom of heaven
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
so today the New Hampshire House of
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%

I Rise to ask this body to vote no on
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of itl and
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
instead pass the amendment in your seat
 
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.730 align:start position:0%
instead pass the amendment in your seat
pocket

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 531 deals with tobacco and
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
nicotine taxes which represent about 10
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
percent of our annual funds raised in
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
House Bill 531
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
was written to make sure that our rates
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
are competitive in the region
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
by adjusting rates
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
to even eight eight percent below other
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
states all other states in the region we
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
would raise about 20 million dollars uh
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
would raise some tax rates and it would
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
lower at least one other
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 531 was also written in
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
part to get engage those in the front
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
line in the trenches in New Hampshire we
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
have 10 000 or more of them they are
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
the inspiration for me came from reading
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
an article in the New York Times in
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
November 2022 which dealt with online
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling passed by the
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2018 to 2020.
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
let me quote from the article it says
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
today 31 States permit Sports gambling
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
online the gambling industry pressed
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
states to set tax rates low on sports
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
betting warning that if States pushed
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
the rates too high sports fans would
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
turn to the black market to place bets
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
on unregulated sites
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
still quoting those warnings were
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
misplaced some States including New York
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire ignored the industry's
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
advice and instead installed the highest
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
rates on betting they have seen bets
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
placed at a higher rate per capita than
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
the low rate states
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
well the New York Times didn't get it
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
completely right in New Hampshire the
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission formed a joint
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
venture with an online sports betting
 
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.490 align:start position:0%
venture with an online sports betting
company

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means didn't create a low tax
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
we followed the employee's lead and
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
formed a partnership which yields a take
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
of over 50 percent of the amount bet uh
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
portion for uh payouts the monies we've
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
raised have helped set offset other tax
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
rates changes in the state
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
another example of a syntax where the
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
effective tax is largely set by
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
employees with our overtight is alcohol
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
the effective tax rate for hard liquor
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
like a bottle of Tito's is set by the
 
00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
state-run liquor store through the price
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
over the amount they pay they charge the
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission makes hundreds of
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
these decisions every day without the
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislature micromanaging them and
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
setting an exact amount above the cost
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
that they can charge
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
setting a proper method for taxation
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
Taxation and tax rate isn't easy and the
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
importance of the revenue largely from
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax is critical unlike other
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
tax part of the role of syntax is it is
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
discourage use of the item the American
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
Heart Association and the American
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
Cancer Society have called for us to
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
raise cigarette taxes by at least one
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
dollar per pack
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
these offsetting public health and state
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
revenue concerns are challenging for
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
groups like Ways and Means
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
still I recognize there were concerns
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
that some of the rates just by changing
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
by eight percent down to eight percent
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
below may represent a burden which is uh
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
in particular The Vaping tax which is
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
eight percent in the state of New
 
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all of our surrounding
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
states have have a rate no lower than 44
 
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
states have have a rate no lower than 44
percent

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
a difference like that is is reason
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
enough for Ways and Means to take a look
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
at it to see if we're getting it right
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh but the bill uh even after the
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
amendment still also includes engagement
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
about the use of tobacco funds including
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
the very important tobacco settlement
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
funds uh there are other opportunities
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
in what we do for example in North
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
Carolina they have a program called
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
Golden Leaf the Golden Leaf fund is
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
supplied over 55 million in higher
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
education grants in combination with
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
their legislature
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
so the information provided by the
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
report that would be an output of the
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
amendment would enable discussions with
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
ways and means to see if the portion of
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
the funds could be better and better
 
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.349 align:start position:0%
the funds could be better and better
aligned

00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
so this is uh this is a two committee
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
bill at this point which would go to
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means uh should the amendment
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh uh pass
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh without House Bill 531 in any form
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means will have no bills
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
related to tax to tobacco and nicotine
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
aside from the premium cigar bill they
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
have to serve as a vehicle for better
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
policy so therefore I ask you uh to
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the motion to itl so
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
that the motion uh the amendment can be
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
voted on which would just create a
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
report and allow Ways and Means to chime
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
in on nicotine and tobacco policy
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
chair recognize the representative hunt
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh the Commerce
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
Committee is a policy committee and we
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
were looking at as a policy not at the
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
actual tax rates the policy being that
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
we were going to set in statute that we
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
would be requiring uh monitoring of
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
other states did not seem appropriate
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
for legislation
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
see that that is something that the Ways
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee has done
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
historically over the years they don't
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
need a bill to do it they can do it when
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
they set the tax rates when we come up

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
I rise today to speak out against the
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 639.
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
this bill will create an addiction for
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
profit industry in our beautiful state
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill does not contribute to the
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
common good it puts profits ahead of
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
public health and safety
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
it will create bigger government putting
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
an added burden on our taxpayers the
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
health safety and economic harms will
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
far outweigh the perceived social
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
benefits the costs of legalization of
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
cannabis will fire away any profits due
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
to increased Health Care obligations due
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
to addiction and increased law
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement due to collisions fatalities
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
and ambulance calls
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
the commercialization model is
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
collapsing every state that has
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
legalized cannabis has an exploding
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
Black Market
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
indeed the black Market's price will
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
always be lower than New Hampshire's
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis should not be a
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
political issue it's a public health and
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
safety issue
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
virtually every medical and Psychiatric
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
association in New Hampshire strongly
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
opposes legalization and
 
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.849 align:start position:0%
opposes legalization and
commercialization

00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
commercialization
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
the National Academy of Sciences States
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis is worsening where
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis is legal
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
our Senator Gene Shaheen stated I don't
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
support legalizing marijuana we're in
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
the middle of an opioid epidemic and the
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
research that I've seen suggests that it
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
is a way that more people get into drugs
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Administration is on record
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
stating there is no evidence that
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis is an effective treatment for
 
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.569 align:start position:0%
cannabis is an effective treatment for
PTSD

00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
PTSD
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has no limit for a
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis intoxication and therefore
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
operators are not charged with DUI by
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis in regards to fatal crashes
 
00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why the Billboard's
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
advertising for Amazon drivers in New
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state that they do not test
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
for cannabis
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill will usher in
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
intoxicated truck drivers bus drivers
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
tractor trailer drivers and Beyond
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't be fooled by the addiction for
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
profit industry that claim tax revenue
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
will solve all our budget problems
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
my colleagues I implore you do not vote
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
for this bill it will change our state
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
in unimaginable ways none of which
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
promote the common good
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker I ask to you for you to
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
join me and vote no on House Bill 639
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
and press the red button
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I ask for a division vote
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
no I do not remember does not yield
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
I Rise also in opposition to the bill
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana is another gateway drug like
 
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.530 align:start position:0%
marijuana is another gateway drug like
alcohol

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
talk to many addicts they say they
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
started either with alcohol or marijuana
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
then moved other drugs they needed to
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
get higher
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
I see there are two reasons people drink
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol either they like the taste and
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'll I'm with that or they need to drink
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
to cope with their life other than
 
00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:19.099 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana but more on that later
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
the only reason to smoke or eat cannabis
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
and if Mana one it doesn't work it can
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
always move up the cocaine when we will
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
start pushing that
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
some years ago Harvard Medical came out
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
with a study showing that marijuana
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
causes brain damage in people under 21.
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
so let's make it easier for children to
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
get it
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
I was in high school in the military in
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
the 60s for those that remember or heard
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
of that period it was filled with
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
marijuana and Other Drugs
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
hippies flower children Woodstock
 
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.190 align:start position:0%
hippies flower children Woodstock
Etc

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
my high was going to parties and
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
watching people make complete fools of
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or Worse luckily we didn't
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
have smartphones and small social media
 
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.390 align:start position:0%
have smartphones and small social media
then

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
I never smoked Mal marijuana or took
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
those other drugs they were all readily
 
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.829 align:start position:0%
those other drugs they were all readily
available

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
but a lot of us were too smart to follow
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
in that crowd and for the record I did
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
not live a sheltered life I was
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
completely much on my own since I was
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
15. I disowned my father and completely
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
left home when I was 17. and for those
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
that even today makes excuses for
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
themselves because of their life I say
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
you make your own life
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
let's say you get stopped while driving
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and it looks like a DUI for alcohol it
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
can be proven breath or alcohol it
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
cannot be determined for marijuana it
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
will be subjective
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
the police they will be in your blood
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
for maybe two weeks
 
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:07.940 align:start position:0%
where marijuana the police officer will
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
subjectively prove you under the
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
influence may even say he or she may
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
even say they smelled marijuana
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
just like any profession there are bad
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
cops bad lawyers bad State reps
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
and with legalizing it you will have
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
more marijuana Duo DUIs as new people
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
will now use it and at my age we'll have
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
a problem walking a straight line anyway
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the marijuana Lobby would spend
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
their money working on a non-subjective
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
way of determining if someone is under
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
the influence
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
and interesting I don't know about the
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
surveys but I never had anyone asking me
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
if I want to legalize marijuana in a
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
survey and I've answered questions
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
debate and debates Etc and I was against
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
it I know of reps that ran on opposing
 
00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:02.569 align:start position:0%
it I know of reps that ran on opposing
it

00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it appears even in other states that
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
have legalized it legalize it it's
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
cheaper on the street
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
the black market will get worse
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
now 21 year olds can legally buy it and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
then sell it to their underage friends
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
and at one time in my life I believe
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
that everything should be legal I
 
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
thought I should be able to go to a
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
drugstore and get medicine but it ailed
 
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.370 align:start position:0%
drugstore and get medicine but it ailed
me

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
why should I go to the doctor
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
but then I grew up and found out there
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
are stupid people that will injure or
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
kill themselves putting a financial
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
burden on the rest of us and where is
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
the state getting an illegal Federal
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
substance to sell
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
will it be laced with fentanyl
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
and then will the state be responsible
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
now for medical marijuana
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
I testified on this many years ago here
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the house floor
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
if marijuana is great for some illnesses
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
then why doesn't big Pharma sell it
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
you can get prescription then and be a
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
whole lot cheaper
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
they sell and walk at every other drug
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
but then it makes one high again it will
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
obscure any pain
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
I remember when medical marijuana became
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
legal in California a lot of the shops
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
had signed stating the doctor is in and
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
for 25 dollars you can get a
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
prescription for marijuana
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
and by the way I've taken opioid for
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
pain broken red motorcycle accidents
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
etc etc and both most of those pills
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
ended up in the police boxes and even
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
had not filled prescriptions so don't
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
blame the doctors it is your
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility but for people in
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
constant pain let them have what they
 
00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:49.630 align:start position:0%
constant pain let them have what they
want

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
and because every other state is doing
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
it remember what your brother told you
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
if everyone just jumps off the bridge
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
are you going to follow
 
00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:01.970 align:start position:0%
are you going to follow
also

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
also if legal will be reselling spelling
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
it in any room some years ago you could
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
luckily the perpetrator was arrested for
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
other crimes and went to prison
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
a year ago last Friday though from those
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
here then remember I ended up I ended
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's speech
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
on my cable show on Friday my co-host
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
reminded me of that the governor called
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
me that day jokingly said I know we
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
don't agree on everything
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
but I do know that I agree with him on
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
this and so it will be vetoed
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
and don't be intimidated by leadership
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
that is sponsoring this bill you work
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
for your constituents not your
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
leadership and your vote counts the same
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
as theirs and I vehemently asked that no
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
one called for a roll call let us vote
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
our conscience I will vote no I vote
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
what's good for the state and
 
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.410 align:start position:0%
what's good for the state and
constituents

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
and one last thing
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of us this past summer signed a
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
pledge for no new taxes isn't paying a
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
tax on something new a new tax
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
so guess ability get high sometimes
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
overrides that played for some of us and
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
also this is another case will you need
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
an ID
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
so vote no on your pledge and protect
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
our children thank you Mrs remember you
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.950 align:start position:0%
owe the questions no member does not

Goodwill and diligent work of both

political parties the representative
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
from Auburn stated that what you are
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
looking at here is the result of a
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
number of months of work by the an
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
entire Coalition of groups and Advocates
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
everything from the business side to the
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
consumer side the Civil Rights side to
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%

concerned about child safety the end
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
result is a bill that may well be the
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
most comprehensive plan that we have
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
seen for legislation of cannabis in New
 
00:50:20.819 --> 00:50:21.650 align:start position:0%
seen for legislation of cannabis in New
Hampshire

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
the house Commerce Committee labored to
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
come up with a final version of the
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that would work for members of
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
both parties and for those who spent
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
months working with the Cannabis
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
Coalition under the revised Amendment
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
there will be a liquor and cannabis
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
commission with a second commissioner to
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
oversee the sale and regulation of
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana and related products in
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
community hearing the consensus what's
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
that we should have experienced
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
Insurance Commissioners overseeing the
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
new cannabis industry to jump start this
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
important new industry in New Hampshire
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
the house Commerce Committee
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
has been a model of bipartisan
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
cooperation this term we disagree we
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
debate and challenge one another there
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%

to learn from each other find common
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
ground and craft new collaborative

now join other New England states that
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
offer safe regulated and profit and
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
profitable cannabis industry to their

it the reasonable way the responsible
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
way the Innovative way and the
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
in committee hearings the consensus of
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
those who labored on this bill agreed
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
that why they may have not gotten
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
everything that they wanted from this
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
bill they got what they needed and that
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
is to paraphrase the 21st century
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
philosophers Mick Jagger and Keith

possible and I hope you will support not
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
only this Innovative bill but to
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
recognize what we can achieve as a
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
legislature if we were able to work
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
together I would urge you to vote OTB by
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
pushing the the green button that bears
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
the beautiful green color of the
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis plant thank you there's a
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
does a member yield the questions
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
remember yields
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative verville
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm in my fourth term here and I I
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
remember we decriminalized up to a half
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
an ounce of marijuana in the state of
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if the Doomsday sky is
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
falling type testimony we're hearing
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
um was to actually occur wouldn't we
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
have already seen that in the
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of a half an ounce or
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
a less of marijuana in the state I'm
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't understand your question
 
00:52:49.809 --> 00:52:49.819 align:start position:0%
but we see Doom coming
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
sorry so we decriminalized marijuana
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
half an ounce or less in the state right
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
so when we hear testimony that it's
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to increase addiction it's going
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
to increase Supply it's going to
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
increase black markets uh driving while
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
under the influence and all that if that
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
was correct if that was true wouldn't we
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
already have seen those effects from the
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
previous decriminalization of a half an
 
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:13.309 align:start position:0%
previous decriminalization of a half an
ounce

00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
ounce
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we've seen those
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
kinds of negative effects from marijuana
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
in the past and I don't think we will
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the legalization of this Bill thank
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
you representative I agree 100 thank you
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
is remembering all the further questions
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
remember yields
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you to my
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
dear colleague for being willing to take
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
I spent a lot of time reading a very
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
very long amendment that I understand
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
was not presented to the Commerce
 
00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:57.740 align:start position:0%
Committee until the very last moment
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
by the distinguished chair of the
 
00:54:00.359 --> 00:54:01.450 align:start position:0%
by the distinguished chair of the
committee

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:01.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
I am puzzled about one central point and
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you can help me when the
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission was created as an
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
Enterprise operation it was to free The
 
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:18.020 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission from any unnecessary
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
oversight by the legislature and other
 
00:54:22.619 --> 00:54:24.049 align:start position:0%
oversight by the legislature and other
um uh

00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh and other oversight responsibilities
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
and I am really curious about why given
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
how difficult the situation is you would
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
agree to give to the Liquor Commission
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for figuring out how
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a success out of
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I think again this was a delicate
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
dance and negotiation there were those
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
on the committee who did not feel that
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission was the
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate vehicle to oversee this
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
there were there were some including
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
those on the Cannabis commission who
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be more
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a separate
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry The Liquor Commission to
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
oversee it they thought it would be more
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a cannabis
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
commission oversee it and again this was
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
one of the um one of the the things that
 
00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
we felt that we needed to compromise
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
because we felt it was more important to
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
get this bill passed and to have
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalized in the state
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
as a member yield to further questions
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you for
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
taking my question the body just heard a
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
couple of comments from speakers before
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
you to the effect of this would create
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous bus drivers dangerous truck
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
drivers uh were you aware as I am as a
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
commercially Drive licensed driver
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
myself that in fact all of those
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
positions require a commercial driver's
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
license and that is done by the federal
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
DOT which requires a drug test including
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana test in order to get said
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
license and a yearly test by your
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
employer and if you fail it not only do
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
you lose your job you also lose that
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
license and any ability to hold a future
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
I was not fully aware of all that but I
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker that's
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
fellow Republicans
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to House Bill 639
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
when Vermont was considering legalizing
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana back in 2016. I
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
wrote an op-ed for the local paper and I
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
asked this hypothetical question
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
if marijuana is legalized before a legal
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
standard for impairment is established
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be a shame if the state
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
could not convict someone especially in
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
the case of an Accident Injury or
 
00:57:13.619 --> 00:57:15.290 align:start position:0%
the case of an Accident Injury or
fatality

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
fatality
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
because there was no standard of proof
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
the question didn't stay hypothetical
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
very long
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
in September 2018 Keith Cushman of
 
00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:26.990 align:start position:0%
in September 2018 Keith Cushman of
Lebanon

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
consumed marijuana got in his truck and
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
drove at high speed into the ledge's
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
long Interstate 91 in Norwich Vermont
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
he injured himself and he killed
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
Theodore Haley
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
his passenger
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
all Cushman received was a suspended
 
00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:44.510 align:start position:0%
all Cushman received was a suspended
sentence

00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
how come
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
it's easy to convict someone
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
who's driving intoxicated because a
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
legal limit exists .08 and there is a
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
way to test that number a blood test
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
that will stand up in court as evidence
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way with marijuana
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
there is no legal standard for
 
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
there is no legal standard for
impairment

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
impairment
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
some police officers are trained as drug
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
recognition experts
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
to help make the more credible Witnesses
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
in court but not every officer is a Dre
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
in fact in cushman's case the Dre could
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
only partially evaluate him because of
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
his injuries
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
the state would have had trouble
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
proving a felony DUI against him because
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
Vermont did not have objective roadside
 
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
Vermont did not have objective roadside
tests

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
tests
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
for impairment for anything other than
 
00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:39.349 align:start position:0%
for impairment for anything other than
alcohol

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
y's family called it insane that the
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
state pushed for legalizing marijuana
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
without such a test in place
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's more than that
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
voting to legalize a drug for
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
recreational use without giving police
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
the tools they need to arrest and
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
prosecute impaired drivers is
 
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.630 align:start position:0%
prosecute impaired drivers is
indefensible

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
the hypothetical is now real
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
Theodore Haley died
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
Keith Cushman served no jail term
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
it is a shame that the state could not
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
improve impairment because it lacked a
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
standard of proof
 
00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:22.460 align:start position:0%
his life was worth more than that
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
Haley's father said
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
in conclusion Mr Speaker
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
let's not make the same mistake that
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
Vermont did
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
because of a standard of no there was no
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
standard of proof
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
Keith Cushman walked free even though
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
his actions caused Theodore Haley to pay
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
with his life
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
please vote no on House Bill 639 Mr

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%

I rise today in total opposition of this
 
01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:12.230 align:start position:0%
I rise today in total opposition of this
bill

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
I could stand up here right now
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
we talk about all the statistics from
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
all the other states that have legalized
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
marijuana and are selling in their
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
states and all the reasons that it is
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
wrong for New Hampshire
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
but instead
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to remind you
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
of where you are
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
we are the leaders
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
of our nation our constitution set the
 
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.150 align:start position:0%
of our nation our constitution set the
standard

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have Mount Washington we have 18.75
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
miles of Coastland
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
we have the Connecticut Valley
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
for our most important resource is our
 
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
for our most important resource is our
people

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
puts our people in jeopardy
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
I rise today to keep a promise
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
I promise my constituents that I would
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
oppose marijuana legislation and they
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly elected me in my town
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
I stand right now today
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
to represent the voices of everyone in
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
this state touched by the opioid and
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the deaths of their family
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
members that have occurred from it
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
I Rise for them
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
and to keep a promise
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I urge you to
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I rise in support of this
 
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I rise in support of this
bill

01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason I do so is because
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
what the Commerce Committee attempted to
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
do was to try to
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
create a balanced bill that will address
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have heard over the
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
years in terms of the legalization of
 
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.370 align:start position:0%
years in terms of the legalization of
marijuana

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't solve some of the
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
testing problems or some of the other
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
issues that may occur and I understand
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
why people may not want to vote for
 
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.829 align:start position:0%
why people may not want to vote for
marijuana

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
but the issue that we had in Commerce
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
was if we're going to do this how do we
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
ensure that our citizens are getting it
 
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.430 align:start position:0%
ensure that our citizens are getting it
safely

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
and when we look at the safety issue the
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee is also the liquor
 
01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:51.650 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee is also the liquor
Commission

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.390 align:start position:0%
Commission
committee

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
along with the Liquor Commission is
 
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.650 align:start position:0%
along with the Liquor Commission is
tobacco

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
many people don't know how much our
 
01:03:00.059 --> 01:03:01.609 align:start position:0%
many people don't know how much our
enforcers

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
enforcers
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
are actually responsible for ensuring
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
that tobacco is not sold to anyone under
 
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
that tobacco is not sold to anyone under
1821.

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
what I want to say is is that it made
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
sense to not reinvent the wheel and
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
create a new Commission
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
that had an Advisory board that was
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
political right in the public hearings
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
people were adding wanted to add more
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
people to this Commission
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
what Commerce did was is say we're going
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
to take a model that we are successful
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
with here in New Hampshire
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
and repeat it
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
and therefore we chose the Liquor
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
Commission to be the regulatory body
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
they have the hearings officers they
 
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.349 align:start position:0%
they have the hearings officers they
have

01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
group two officers who are entitled to
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
go in and making sure that underage
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
people will not be able to buy this
 
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.890 align:start position:0%
people will not be able to buy this
product

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
we are requiring the licensees to be
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated in terms of uh that in
 
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh how who they sell to and
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
also what they sell it has to be tested
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
by a third-party group that will be
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
certified by the state
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
so yes it is true that this bill was
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
modeled after Liquor Commission and some
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
and question about the modernization
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
well in the key element of the
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
modernization was that the legislature
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
should not be telling every little
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
Nuance that the Liquor Commission as
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
public hearings process and if you read
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
this bill you'll never see more rule
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
making than you ever see in any other
 
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.789 align:start position:0%
making than you ever see in any other
statute

01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
the commission is
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
capable of doing this and more
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
importantly they're capable of doing it
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
safely and ensuring that we take care of
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's citizen number one
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
priority which is not to allow marijuana
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
in the hands of younger age people
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to please support this
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%

if I know that the Commerce Committee
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%

replaces the pension reforms of 2011.
 
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:34.980 align:start position:0%

and I know that this class of 100
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
1731 represents one ten thousandth
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker I know that the New Hampshire
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 10
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
states that government
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
being instituted for the common good
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
common benefit
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
protection and security of the whole
 
01:27:19.739 --> 01:27:21.050 align:start position:0%
protection and security of the whole
community

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and not for the private interest or
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
emolument of any one-man
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
please allow me to quote from one of our
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
country's greatest
 
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
Acid Rock
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
garage Punk singers
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
it was the best of times
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
it was the worst of crimes
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
Taylor Swift felt like she was in a
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
speeding getaway car
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm in a speeding Runaway
 
01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm in a speeding Runaway
Train

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
Train
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing I am able to do I'm
 
01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
not able to do anything about it
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
I believe that a bill written for such
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
an infinitesimal percent of our
 
01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.370 align:start position:0%
an infinitesimal percent of our
population

01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
is not instituted for the common good
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
nor is it instituted for the whole
 
01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.010 align:start position:0%
nor is it instituted for the whole
community

01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
and thus I feel this bill goes against
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
I asked for a roll call vote Mr speaker
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of hb3 436 it's
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
a complicated Bill and so I will do my
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
best to convey to the general court some
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
of its intricacies what I would like to
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
start with is just explaining kind of
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
the background history of how this
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
situation came to be back in the early
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
2000s pension systems across the country
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
started running into problems because
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't funded appropriately
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
legislation that had been passed in all
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
of those States left us uh in a
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
situation where we could not meet all of
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
the obligations of the retirement system
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
over the course of the life of the
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
people who were in them so in 2011 New
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not being an exception to that
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
rule I got a group of legislators
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
together to try to address the issue and
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
on the whole I think that they did a
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic job
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
um we were possibly running into
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
insolvency they made a lot of decisions
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
that really shored things up
 
01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:32.169 align:start position:0%
that really shored things up
um

01:29:32.169 --> 01:29:32.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
as um sorry
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
um so three things contributed to uh the
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
shortfall first uh we weren't funding
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
the program appropriately secondly at
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
the same time the federal government
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
released uh new mortality tables that
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
said that people were living longer and
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
since people were living longer their
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
calculations needed to go out further
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
which meant that the funds that we had
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
were we thought were going to be enough
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
work could be enough because it was
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be spread out over a long
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
period of time the third was if we all
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
remember correctly after 2008 there was
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
a huge downturn in the stock market
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
meaning the value of our savings to go
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
towards the pension program was now
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
worth less than it had been previously
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
so those three things contributed to
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
what we now have as the unfunded
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
liability of of the New Hampshire
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
retirement system so in order to address
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we did back
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
in 2011 as we changed the calculation of
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
benefits for people in the New Hampshire
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system it used to be your
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
best three years average times the years
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
that you were employed times a 2.5
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
multiplier the new plan changed to your
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
the time that you have the number of
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
years you've been employed and the
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
multiplier changed down to get down to
 
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
two percent eventually
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
so what we ended up with is the decision
 
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
of we have to change the plan we have to
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
change the benefits so that we can
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
afford to make sure that people get
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
their benefits in the future
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
where are we where I depart from the
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
people who made the decisions in 2011 is
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
simply this when do you implement the
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
new benefits calculation
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
they decided to do it
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
um basically at the point investment
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
investment is when somebody who's in the
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
retirement system now is locked in they
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
definitely get a benefit in New
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even though it wasn't in
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
statute this puts it in statute we
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
always operated as if it was 10 years so
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
you had to work 10 years for New
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh retirement system to group
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
two in order to receive a definite
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
benefit retirement benefit for the rest
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
of your life if you hadn't reached that
 
01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
10-year Mark what we did in 2011 is we
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
changed the calculations for people who
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
had already been working for nine nine
 
01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:36.860 align:start position:0%
and a half years but were not yet vested
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
every other state
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
just made the changes from that point
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
forward new hires forward and so they're
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
just making the change for new hires
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
forward we went and we said no if you're
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
not vested meaning you could have worked
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
one year you could work five years you
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
could have worked nine and a half years
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
you were going on to a transitionary
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
um benefit calculation plan that was not
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
the one that you agreed to when you
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
signed on so my my concern with this my
 
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
problem with this is simply this
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
those men and women who have dedicated
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
their services and criminal justice and
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
fire and in police
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
dedicated their time
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
and they dedicated their money they have
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
to pay into the system with the
 
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
understanding that they were going to
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
get a specific benefit for the time and
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
the money that they put in and unlike
 
01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
other Retirement Systems other unlike
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
other pension systems New Hampshire
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's retirement system is
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
in statute it's encoded in law
 
01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's not a general contract like you
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
typically have somewhere else if you
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
went to the law the law said you put in
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
your time you put in your money this is
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
what the state of New Hampshire will do
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we went back and we retroactively
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
changed that law to affect people who
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
who joined and started their employment
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
with a different understanding
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
and I just think from a moral ethical
 
01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:53.930 align:start position:0%
and I just think from a moral ethical
standpoint

01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not the right way to
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
do things
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
um it has created a drop in morale among
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
our group two members
 
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
um it has dropped our morale and our
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
ability to hire new members we have
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that if we're willing to
 
01:33:11.689 --> 01:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
pass this bill which essentially rolls
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
back year after year people from the
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
transitionary compensation system back
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
to the original one that they had when
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
they were hired it'll be a 10-year
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
process every year a new group will be
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
rolled in we will have the ability to
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
retain people for longer and because
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
their benefit package will go up their
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
incentivized to stay even longer still
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
they might stay two three four five more
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
years and when we're already short
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
staffed in those areas areas like
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
criminal criminal justice areas like
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
police areas like fire we can't really
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
afford to lose more people out of that
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
system it will boost morale again and it
 
01:33:50.090 --> 01:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
will help us to um to retain workers in
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
that way as well so
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I would just urge The General Port so
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
press the green button and support the
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
majority opinion of Edna and pass HB 436
 
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:03.659 align:start position:0%

representative Sano Natasha was
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.960 --> 01:35:14.870 align:start position:0%

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:37.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee report of Auto pass is amended
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 436.
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative true for
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
would have us spend an average of about
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per
 
01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.370 align:start position:0%
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per
person

01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
for a very specific group of 1731 mostly
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Municipal Employees
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
and if I know this specific group has a
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
superior pensions to the newer employees
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this matter has
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
already been adjudicated by the New
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
but I now push the red button to defeat
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
the pending motion thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
is the representative Carol McGuire for
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that we
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a massive problem with the
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention among our
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
group two workers that is police fire
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
and Corrections
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we have her testimony
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
significant cause of that trouble is the
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
decreased pension benefits in particular
 
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.330 align:start position:0%
decreased pension benefits in particular
the

01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:13.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
benefits for those who were employed but
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
not vested in 2011.
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that the money we're
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
putting into this from the general fund
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
will relieve some of our Recruitment and
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
Retention problems would I not press the
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%

2 retirees the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%

system this comes to be for us without
recommendation

01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:20.940 align:start position:0%

01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie moves ought to

pass here I recognizes representative
 
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.330 align:start position:0%
pass here I recognizes representative
Simon

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 571 uh the purpose of a
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
cola is essentially to allow people in
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
the retirement system to keep up with
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
um the difficulties of inflation
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and so from my perspective the reason
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
to give a cola is to help the people who
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
are in the most need who are suffering
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
the most under the weight of inflation
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
to get the help that they need to be
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
able to to pay their bills and I just
 
01:39:55.129 --> 01:39:55.139 align:start position:0%
want to give you a few reasons why I
 
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
think 571 is an inadequate Bill to
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
accomplish that task outside of the New
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system the the
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
closest comparative system is Social
 
01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:06.179 align:start position:0%
Security and even in the minority
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
reports some
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
some comparison between the New
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and Social
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
Security was made stating that Social
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
Security people members get colas they
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
recently received a cola
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to make sure that the
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
body is informed of the difference
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
between Social Security and the New
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system at least as
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
well as I can the New Hampshire
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system is a little bit of a
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole and the more you go down the
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
more complicated it gets however if I
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
were to take the first group of retirees
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
2013 that would benefit from this Cola
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
the average pension for firefighters
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
coming out of that group in 2013 was 57
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
231 that is a pension that they will
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
receive annually from now until they die
 
01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
and then surviving spouse as well so
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
um so that would be their average
 
01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.410 align:start position:0%
um so that would be their average
benefit

01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
um it's the for these particular people
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
it's their three best years average to
 
01:41:01.739 --> 01:41:02.689 align:start position:0%
it's their three best years average to
get

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
um to to use as their multiplier for
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
Social Security they use your best 35
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
years and it is inflation that adjusted
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be fair does inflation adjusted but
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's a cap there's a Max that you can
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
contribute to in Social Security year
 
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
after year if you max out that table for
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
35 years and you retire right now the
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit that you can get
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted through Social
 
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
Security is forty three thousand dollars
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
in change
 
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
so the average firefighter in 2013
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's looking for a cola is already
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
receiving fourteen thousand dollars more
 
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
than the maximum social security benefit
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
if you if you max out the table is going
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
to receive so it's comparing apples and
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
oranges the other thing I would say
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
about it is if you retires in group two
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
you can start receiving benefits at the
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
age of 52.
 
01:41:51.119 --> 01:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
age of 52.
um

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
whereas everybody else if you want to
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
receive your full social security
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
benefit you have to wait until you're
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
67. so if you're receiving 57 000 a year
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
from the age of 52 to the age of 67
 
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to accrue 858
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
000 worth of retirement benefits before
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else is even able to start
 
01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.109 align:start position:0%
anybody else is even able to start
collecting

01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
that being said once you start
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
collecting your Social Security benefits
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
if you've maxed out the table if you're
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
getting the maximum benefit that you can
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be in your 90s before you hit
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that 858 thousand dollar Mark so that
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
means because our average lifespan is
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
about 82
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
most firefighters from that eight from
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
that year will receive more in
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits before everyone else
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
starts collecting then everyone else
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
will receive it before they die
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so if we're looking to give a cola
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
to people who need it the most on a wide
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
scale I don't think that this bill hits
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
the mark but I'll argue one more thing
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
even if we're just dealing with group
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
two members this bill misses the mark
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bill gives a five percent Cola for
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
up to the first fifty thousand dollars
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
of benefit for a group two retiree
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes they've been retired for 10 to 20
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
years it gives a 10 Cola to people up to
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars a year if they've
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
been retired for 20 years or more what
 
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
does that mean well if we take the
 
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
highest recipient of a pension from that
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
10-year group that would be a hundred
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
and thirty six thousand dollar a year
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
pension uh for a retired police chief
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
that retired police chief already
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
getting a hundred and thirty six
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh pension if he's been
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
retired for 10 years will get a twenty
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollar increase
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
if you have a thirty thousand dollar
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
pension in the same group you'll get a
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollar increase year
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
over year so the person who's making a
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten thousand dollars more
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
is going to get a larger benefit out of
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
this bill than the person who's
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
receiving a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
less if we're trying to get help to the
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
people who need it most this bill fails
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
miserably so for those reasons I just
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
urge uh the members of the general court
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
to press the red button and find this
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative uh Senator Testo has
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry I get ahead of
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
myself here uh the chair recognized
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
group two members
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
currently pay
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
into the retirement system as well as
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
the one thing group two members do not
 
01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.870 align:start position:0%
the one thing group two members do not
get

01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
is social security
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
and you need to remember that
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
and if they do for some reason get
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
enough quotas enough quarters in Social
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
the windfall exemption act can take as
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
much as 90 percent of what they are
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to away
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
so they do not see the benefits of
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
Social Security even though they pay
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do is provide a
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
Cola a five percent on the first fifty
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
thousand on any group two member police
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
fire Corrections
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
proud of the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
system or beneficiary of that individual
 
01:45:37.729 --> 01:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
those have been retired at least 10
 
01:45:37.739 --> 01:45:38.750 align:start position:0%
those have been retired at least 10
years

01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
it would also it would provide a 10 Cola
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
on the first fifty thousand dollars for
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
those who have been retired more than 20
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
years 20 years or longer as of July 1st
 
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:56.350 align:start position:0%
years 20 years or longer as of July 1st
2023

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
as most of you know
 
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
the latest
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
Cola for Social Security was 8.7 this
 
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.810 align:start position:0%
Cola for Social Security was 8.7 this
year

01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
and group two members
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't get that Social Security if they
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
do it's a very limited basis like I just
 
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.169 align:start position:0%
do it's a very limited basis like I just
explained

01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.689 --> 01:46:20.699 align:start position:0%
we also had testimony
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
that since the Inception of the
 
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system in 1967 and up until
 
01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.330 align:start position:0%
retirement system in 1967 and up until
1983

01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
1983
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
callers would be granted by the
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
legislature and funded by the general
 
01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.669 align:start position:0%
legislature and funded by the general
fund

01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
then in 1983 the legislature codified
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
the funding of the coals establishing a
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
special account
 
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
and in the rsas
 
01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
stated that the special account shall be
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
used only to fund or partially fund
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
additional benefits for retired members
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
so it has been
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
part of the system when it was
 
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
part of the system when it was
established

01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s the legislation made
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
changes to the special account and
 
01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
stipulated first to provide supplemental
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
allowances or coalesce pursuant to RSA
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
100a colon 41A before any other benefit
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
then we go to 2012 and we hear about all
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
the changes made in the system
 
01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
and the legislature got rid of the
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
special account and the funding source
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
so I stand here before you today asking
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
that knowing that the legislature in the
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
past funded retiree coal is knowing that
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
retiree colas are necessary to help keep
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
up with the cost of inflation than what
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
I press the green button in both of us
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.010 align:start position:0%
thank you

571

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
other remember yield the questions
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:29.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
Auto pass on House Bill 571 this will be
 
01:49:06.649 --> 01:49:06.659 align:start position:0%
a division vote chair recognizes Carol
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
speaker if I know that this
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
this bill which creates a cost of living
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
increase only for group two is divisive
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that we granted a
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
cola two years ago to all of the lowest
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
paid retirees in the system from both
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
Group 1 and group two
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this would require 84
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
million from the general fund
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
would I not press the red button so that
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
I recognize represent over Bryant for a
 
01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:12.109 align:start position:0%
I recognize represent over Bryant for a
parliamentary

01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.770 --> 01:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
state established a system of paying
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
calls to group two retirees since the
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
start of the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
system way back in 1967.
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
then in 1983 they codified the funding
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
with a special account until 2012 when
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
it was unfortunately eliminated
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
and if I further know since that time of
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
granting colas has been at the whim of
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature was several years
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
passing even though the federal
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
government has issued increases of
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
Social Security
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
a benefit group two members do not
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
receive by law
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
then if you believe as I do that is the
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility to its nhrs group
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
two members to provide them with colas
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
in their retirement and then please vote
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
with me and the majority of the board of
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%

01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
not the right time to fund such an issue
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
then I must ask when it is will you
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%

I want to deny care to this population
 
03:09:08.210 --> 03:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
but because Medicaid is not the solution
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
our Health Care system is in crisis one
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
that is long before covid and it was
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
long before the Affordable Care Act we
 
03:09:17.929 --> 03:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of hospital beds because
 
03:09:20.570 --> 03:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
of systemic problems and extending
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to pregnant immigrants and
 
03:09:25.010 --> 03:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
their children will not solve the
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
capacity problems
 
03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
it will change shift what is currently

charity care
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid care
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
when that happens
 
03:09:37.190 --> 03:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to pay
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
for every person who's getting Medicaid
 
03:09:42.349 --> 03:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's paid at a rate that's lower than
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals can provide the cost to
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
private insurance goes up
 
03:09:48.969 --> 03:09:48.979 align:start position:0%
that cost to private insurance goes up
 
03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
premiums go up we shove our families
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
that are living paycheck to paycheck
 
03:09:57.290 --> 03:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
into the Medicaid system because they
 
03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
can no longer afford their own care
 
03:10:03.650 --> 03:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
we're adding people to lifeboats and the
 
03:10:06.410 --> 03:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
lifeboats just don't have that space
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%

03:10:15.230 --> 03:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
we have families that want to come and
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
build communities build businesses build
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
restaurants and build friendships
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
many of these families are getting
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
employment getting health insurance from
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
their employer many others are buying it
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
from the health exchanges
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
we do have some that aren't able to
 
03:10:34.849 --> 03:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
provide for their care
 
03:10:36.889 --> 03:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
and I don't know about you but I'd
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
rather look to charity rather than to
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
expanding government programs
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
if you've looked around on sorry if you
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
looked around on Facebook how many
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
people are telling their story and how
 
03:10:49.370 --> 03:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
many people are getting scammed because
 
03:10:52.250 --> 03:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
we want to help each other people don't
 
03:10:53.929 --> 03:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
know how to help
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
but if we can direct people that want to
 
03:10:59.330 --> 03:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
help about how to support these these
 
03:11:02.570 --> 03:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
endowments or even the direct pay that
 
03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
take immigrants and other people who
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
cannot otherwise provide for their care
 
03:11:08.929 --> 03:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
we will feel good and we will do good
 
03:11:11.210 --> 03:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
I know in the legislature we usually
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
look to the government to solve problems
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's easy because we do government
 
03:11:17.450 --> 03:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
programs so that's the way that we try
 
03:11:18.769 --> 03:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
and help
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
but we often miss the people
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
who are aren't helped or who are
 
03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
actually harmed when we expand these
 
03:11:25.140 --> 03:11:26.510 align:start position:0%
actually harmed when we expand these
programs

03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
we need to realize that no matter how
 
03:11:31.969 --> 03:11:31.979 align:start position:0%
compelling it is to try and Extend
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care to people all we're doing is
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
changing who pays and all we're doing is
 
03:11:39.050 --> 03:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
sending that cost to other families that
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
are on the margin
 
03:11:42.290 --> 03:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
we need to stop adding more people to
 
03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the model is broken it's
 
03:11:47.389 --> 03:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
costing us all please press the red
 
03:11:49.010 --> 03:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion can be
 
03:11:51.410 --> 03:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
made just remember yield the questions
 
03:11:55.370 --> 03:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
no remember does not yield

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:12:08.570 --> 03:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of the bipartisan
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
committee report of ought to pass as
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
amended on HB 282
 
03:12:17.690 --> 03:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
HB 282 is a simple bill it will increase
 
03:12:20.330 --> 03:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
health care access to a small group of
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
low-income New Hampshire residents
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
in 1996 President Clinton's welfare
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
reform act imposed a five-year waiting
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
period for immigrants to be eligible for
 
03:12:33.790 --> 03:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
a variety of federal benefits
 
03:12:36.530 --> 03:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
therefore many New Hampshire immigrants
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
today even if they qualify by income
 
03:12:42.530 --> 03:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
must wait five years to be eligible for
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or for chip
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
in 2009 however the federal government
 
03:12:49.370 --> 03:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
created an option
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
to states to eliminate that five-year
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
wait for children and for pregnant women
 
03:12:58.250 --> 03:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
who are lawfully residing in the U.S but
 
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
not yet citizens
 
03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state in the
 
03:13:05.809 --> 03:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
Northeast and one of only 15 states in
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the whole country that has not taken
 
03:13:09.650 --> 03:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
that option
 
03:13:12.170 --> 03:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
this bill of past will require New
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to amend the Medicaid State
 
03:13:16.130 --> 03:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
plan to provide coverage for otherwise
 
03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
eligible children and pregnant women
 
03:13:21.849 --> 03:13:21.859 align:start position:0%
those considered lawfully residing
 
03:13:24.170 --> 03:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
include those who have recently been
 
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
granted a green card
 
03:13:29.570 --> 03:13:29.580 align:start position:0%

03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
it should be clear that this bill will
 
03:13:39.050 --> 03:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
result in health care coverage for a
 
03:13:41.330 --> 03:13:41.340 align:start position:0%

if I know
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
that adding the addition of cohorts to
 
03:16:50.929 --> 03:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid pool continuing this
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
pattern will only increase the strain on
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
an already fragile Health Care system
 
03:16:57.170 --> 03:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that it doesn't address
 
03:17:00.170 --> 03:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
the barriers preventing Market forces
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
that could reduce health care costs
 
03:17:02.399 --> 03:17:03.889 align:start position:0%
that could reduce health care costs
legitimately

03:17:03.889 --> 03:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
legitimately
 
03:17:06.290 --> 03:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that this bill will
 
03:17:08.929 --> 03:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
increase health insurance premiums would
 
03:17:10.730 --> 03:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button so that

03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
I know that having Medicaid
 
03:17:28.969 --> 03:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
allows moms and kids access preventive
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
care and early care which prevents the
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
need for much more expensive Critical
 
03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
Care down the road
 
03:17:40.809 --> 03:17:40.819 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that critical care
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
costs fall on all of us one way or
 
03:17:43.740 --> 03:17:45.410 align:start position:0%
costs fall on all of us one way or
another

03:17:45.410 --> 03:17:45.420 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to have our state join a
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal program that would give an extra
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
10 months of pregnancy Medicaid benefit
 
03:23:10.490 --> 03:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
to postpartum women up from the two
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
months postpartum coverage they
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
supporters of the bill say this will
 
03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
provide Health Care to women when they
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
are at an increased risk of
 
03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease this is a good
 
03:23:22.370 --> 03:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
thing however there is no income
 
03:23:24.410 --> 03:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirement for this
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
extended taxpayer-funded health
 
03:23:28.490 --> 03:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
insurance and after two months most
 
03:23:30.889 --> 03:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
women return to the workforce
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
so they could be making six figures and
 
03:23:34.370 --> 03:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
still be on Medicaid
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire cannot tailor
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
this bill to fit our needs as a state
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
we cannot require an income eligibility
 
03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot reduce the number of months
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the terms are completely dictated by
 
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
not only that but in the health human
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
services and elderly Affairs committee
 
03:23:53.630 --> 03:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
we have heard time and again how the
 
03:23:56.030 --> 03:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
large pool of Medicaid patients is
 
03:23:58.490 --> 03:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
straining our Hospital Systems adding
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
another cohort to that pool will only
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
further stretch health system resources
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that we solve all Health Care
 
03:24:08.570 --> 03:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
access issues by creating more
 
03:24:10.490 --> 03:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
categories of people eligible for
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is misguided
 
03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen that more Medicaid equals
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
less bets in hospitals due to inadequate
 
03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:18.590 align:start position:0%
less bets in hospitals due to inadequate
reimbursement

03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the res this results in lower quality
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
care for all patients this is not good
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
health policy
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
additionally there has not been
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence brought forth that
 
03:24:31.250 --> 03:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
this bill is even necessary or Justified
 
03:24:32.750 --> 03:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are increased mental health and
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular risks for women in the
 
03:24:37.190 --> 03:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
postpartum period yes however there are
 
03:24:38.690 --> 03:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
also increased mental health and
 
03:24:40.729 --> 03:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular risks for men and women
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
after surgery
 
03:24:44.450 --> 03:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
people of all walks of life are at
 
03:24:46.010 --> 03:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
increased risk for various health
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
conditions depending on their lifestyle
 
03:24:51.769 --> 03:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
age diet careers and genetics the answer
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
to helping people is not scooping them
 
03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
into a Medicaid Eligibility pool
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is no guarantee that they will
 
03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
access Quality Health Care instead we
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
need to focus on fixing our broken
 
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and bringing more
 
03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
affordable options to Consumers
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
continuing to increase the number of
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipients is eventually going
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
to make the system insolvent
 
03:25:17.950 --> 03:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
in fact Josiah Bartlett's Center for
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
politics today released an article and
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
was talking about how the Congressional
 
03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
budget office made a recommendation that
 
03:25:27.290 --> 03:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
the federal government starts to
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
decrease eligibility for Medicaid and
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
also shift more of the costs to the
 
03:25:34.729 --> 03:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
states to prevent the program from
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
becoming insolvent and to deal with the
 
03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:40.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:25:40.610 --> 03:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
if the system becomes unsolvent at that
 
03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:43.729 align:start position:0%
if the system becomes unsolvent at that
point

03:25:43.729 --> 03:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
what will happen
 
03:25:46.910 --> 03:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
will the government have to step in and
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
provide government health insurance for
 
03:25:48.720 --> 03:25:50.210 align:start position:0%
provide government health insurance for
everyone

03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:25:52.030 --> 03:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
I hope not
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen how that plays out in other
 
03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:55.370 align:start position:0%
we've seen how that plays out in other
countries

03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
countries
 
03:25:57.769 --> 03:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
but what I do know is that we see
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion bills like this every
 
03:26:00.420 --> 03:26:01.250 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion bills like this every
year

03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:26:03.170 --> 03:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
and we hear how the payermix of
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
insurances is putting a strain on our
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
health care industry
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
how Medicaid doesn't pay enough and that
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
we need to prop up the system by
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
increasing premiums for private
 
03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
insurance and maintaining protectionist
 
03:26:18.050 --> 03:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
policies that keep out the competition
 
03:26:20.750 --> 03:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
that could truly Drive costs down
 
03:26:23.210 --> 03:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's a house of cards let's not add
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
another unnecessary unjustified program
 
03:26:27.830 --> 03:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
that costs millions of dollars just
 
03:26:29.330 --> 03:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
offering a match especially when there's
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
no income eligibility requirement and we
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
have no authority over the structure of
 
03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
the program thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
also be in order
 
03:26:53.090 --> 03:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
I come before you today in support of HB
 
03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
565 FN
 
03:27:04.010 --> 03:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
the idea for this bill did not come out
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
of thin air

committee or The Honorable
 
03:27:10.969 --> 03:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
representative who brought it to us
 
03:27:13.610 --> 03:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
it is an option created by centers for
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services to
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
address a very real and specific problem
 
03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
the U.S has a significantly higher rate
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
of maternal mortality than other wealthy
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
and even not so wealthy countries around
 
03:27:29.210 --> 03:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
the world
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
statistics from 2019 indicate that there
 
03:27:36.530 --> 03:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
were 17.4 maternal deaths per 100 000
 
03:27:40.330 --> 03:27:40.340 align:start position:0%
live births in the U.S compared to
 
03:27:45.290 --> 03:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
4.5 in the Czech Republic and 1.1 in
 
03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
4.5 in the Czech Republic and 1.1 in
Poland

03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
Poland
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
just to name a few examples
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
there is a growing recognition that
 
03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
postpartum period extends far beyond 60
 
03:27:54.540 --> 03:27:55.610 align:start position:0%
postpartum period extends far beyond 60
days

03:27:55.610 --> 03:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:27:58.190 --> 03:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
this bill will extend Medicaid maternity
 
03:28:01.250 --> 03:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
but care benefits for the current from
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
the current 60 days to a full year
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the state option under the
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
thus far 35 states have or are planning
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
to extend postpartum coverage including
 
03:28:22.250 --> 03:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.729 --> 03:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
currently many women lose coverage at a
 
03:28:28.130 --> 03:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
critical time leading to undiagnosed and
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
untreated conditions such as
 
03:28:32.950 --> 03:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease hypertension
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
depression and substance use disorders
 
03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
in fact the 2022 New Hampshire report on
 
03:28:42.490 --> 03:28:42.500 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality reveals that
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 percent of maternal
 
03:28:47.090 --> 03:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
deaths in the previous two years here in
 
03:28:49.729 --> 03:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had occurred between 43
 
03:28:53.769 --> 03:28:53.779 align:start position:0%
days and one year after childbirth
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 percent of New
 
03:28:58.130 --> 03:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's new mothers are recipients
 
03:28:59.570 --> 03:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
only 25 percent because Medicaid is a
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care Program for low-income
 
03:29:08.570 --> 03:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
people and there is an eligible income
 
03:29:11.570 --> 03:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility to get on Medicaid
 
03:29:13.729 --> 03:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
over 10 percent of new moms report
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
symptoms of depression others struggle
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
with substance use disorders treating
 
03:29:20.570 --> 03:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
these conditions through the first year
 
03:29:22.490 --> 03:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
will not only result in improved
 
03:29:24.050 --> 03:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
maternal health
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
it will enhance the ability of mothers
 
03:29:28.849 --> 03:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
to parent their newly born it will
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
improve the well-being of our youngest
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and offer our children
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.130 --> 03:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense fiscally
 
03:29:44.090 --> 03:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
responsible remedy for a high rate
 
03:29:46.190 --> 03:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
of preventable pregnancy-related
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
mortality and morbidity
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
contrary to some who believe Medicaid
 
03:29:52.849 --> 03:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
recipients will intentionally become
 
03:29:55.790 --> 03:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
pregnant just to maintain their coverage
 
03:29:57.769 --> 03:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
the benefit would actually increase
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
options for Family Planning and reduce
 
03:30:03.530 --> 03:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
unintended future pregnancies
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
once again this is a bill that the
 
03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
Archdiocese the Roman Catholic
 
03:30:12.050 --> 03:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
Archdiocese of Manchester called a
 
03:30:14.090 --> 03:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
pro-life bill
 
03:30:16.130 --> 03:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
expanding postpartum Health Care
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
coverage is a wise investment in the
 
03:30:19.969 --> 03:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of New Hampshire
 
03:30:22.969 --> 03:30:22.979 align:start position:0%

small step closer to Medicaid for all
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
and if I know that any discussion of
 
03:32:02.090 --> 03:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
expanding Medicaid coverage or
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
eligibility should start with an
 
03:32:05.929 --> 03:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
understanding that the current spending
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
levels are unsustainable
 
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that increasing those
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
coverage just at accelerates the
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%

03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2011.
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:47.809 --> 03:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
if you understand a little bit about the
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers Market nutrition program
 
03:37:52.450 --> 03:37:52.460 align:start position:0%
you can quickly come to understand
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.410 --> 03:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
this bill although well-intentioned
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
solves a non-existent problem
 
03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
with a complex top-down solution
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
the Farmers Market nutrition program
 
03:38:12.650 --> 03:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
as implemented under this bill would
 
03:38:15.769 --> 03:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
provide a one-time benefit of thirty
 
03:38:15.779 --> 03:38:17.210 align:start position:0%
provide a one-time benefit of thirty
dollars

03:38:17.210 --> 03:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
to participants in the women infants and
 
03:38:24.889 --> 03:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.530 --> 03:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
the objective ostensibly is to provide
 
03:38:31.250 --> 03:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
access to fresh fruits and vegetables
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.490 --> 03:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
however participants in that program
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
already have access to fresh fruits and
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
vegetables virtually every supermarket
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
certainly all of the major chains
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
except WIC is a form of payment
 
03:38:50.330 --> 03:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
and they sell fresh fruits and
 
03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:52.190 align:start position:0%
and they sell fresh fruits and
vegetables

03:38:52.190 --> 03:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
vegetables
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
so there's actually not a problem being
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
it would however require that in order
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
to make use of that thirty dollar
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
benefit participants would have to seek
 
03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
out and find and and get to a farmers
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
market or Farm Stand that is
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
participating in the program right now
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
if we look to our South where
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has implemented this they
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
have about 100 108 I think if my memory
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
serves me correctly participating
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
vendors who who offer this
 
03:39:26.450 --> 03:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
this benefit
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
they also have five times the population
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has so if you use
 
03:39:33.050 --> 03:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
that as a proxy for the math you can say
 
03:39:36.650 --> 03:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
that maybe 20 25 vendors are likely to
 
03:39:38.690 --> 03:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
be authorized in New Hampshire if we're
 
03:39:41.450 --> 03:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
really generous maybe 40 or 50. so to
 
03:39:43.010 --> 03:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
make use of your one-time benefit of
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars you need to figure out
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
where those vendors are and get to a
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
there's also a significant burden for
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
the vendors themselves so there's an
 
03:39:54.889 --> 03:39:54.899 align:start position:0%
application process you have to provide
 
03:39:56.809 --> 03:39:56.819 align:start position:0%
a history of your sales that needs to
 
03:39:59.210 --> 03:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
tie to your business tax returns you
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
have to provide photos photo IDs and
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
copies of social security cards for all
 
03:40:05.809 --> 03:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
owners operators partners and board
 
03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
members for the organization's selling
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
their produce
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
need to train your employees part-time
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
full-time or even volunteers need to be
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
trained in how to accept the WIC payment
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
for produce
 
03:40:22.729 --> 03:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
and they need to be trained within 30
 
03:40:24.290 --> 03:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
days of starting unemployment and then
 
03:40:25.849 --> 03:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
they need to be retrained at least once
 
03:40:26.809 --> 03:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
you'll also have to implement an
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
electronic Payment Systems so that you
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
can receive the the WIC payment vouchers
 
03:40:35.570 --> 03:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
or you need to
 
03:40:35.580 --> 03:40:36.349 align:start position:0%
or you need to
um

03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
alternately apply to to use paper
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
so you can quickly come to see how
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of those programs that's
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
very well intentioned
 
03:40:52.969 --> 03:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
but as a top-down program that that
 
03:40:56.450 --> 03:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
imposes complexity on the people using
 
03:40:58.130 --> 03:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
it both on the sell side and the buy
 
03:40:58.140 --> 03:40:59.150 align:start position:0%
it both on the sell side and the buy
side

03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:41:01.969 --> 03:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
it simply doesn't make sense that's why
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
this program had low participation in
 
03:41:05.809 --> 03:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:41:07.729 --> 03:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
so a common definition of insanity is
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing over and over again
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
and expecting a different result
 
03:41:14.389 --> 03:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
this program was discontinued in 2011
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
for very good reasons
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
as legislators we need to use scarce
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer resources wisely let's apply
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
them to programs that are efficient and
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
effective not complex top-down programs
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
like one that has already proven to be
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
ineffective I ask my colleagues to
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
please join me in pressing the red
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
button to vote no on the otpa
 
03:41:40.729 --> 03:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that an alternate
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
motion may be brought thank you Mr
 
03:41:42.359 --> 03:41:43.370 align:start position:0%
motion may be brought thank you Mr
Speaker

03:41:43.370 --> 03:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
which I recognizer representative Weber
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
equal to come here
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
as one of us in the house of 2011 I
 
03:41:56.210 --> 03:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
remember that that was a time of
 
03:41:59.809 --> 03:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
sparkly declining revenues and we did
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
away with many many many programs that
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
were effective and that were used and
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
that we needed
 
03:42:11.809 --> 03:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
and we're only just now getting back to
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of the three hundred
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars will free up over a
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten thousand dollars federal
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
funds so we're leveraging the dollars
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
the benefit goes to women and children
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the WIC program
 
03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
and yes they do have access to some of
 
03:42:38.990 --> 03:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
these Foods now but this would give them
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars more to buy more of them
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
restricted just to Fresh local food
 
03:42:48.170 --> 03:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables
 
03:42:48.180 --> 03:42:49.670 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables
and

03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
with respect to the onus that the
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
program brings with it
 
03:42:59.090 --> 03:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
this benefits not only women and
 
03:43:02.110 --> 03:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
children and local farmers
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we ought to leave it to the
 
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
to the potential participants to decide
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
for themselves whether participation in
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
the program is worth it to them
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
but it has the potential to benefit both
 
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
women and children and our farm families
 
03:43:27.300 --> 03:43:28.849 align:start position:0%
women and children and our farm families
uh

03:43:28.849 --> 03:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:28.859 --> 03:43:32.450 align:start position:0%
uh
finally

03:43:32.450 --> 03:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.490 --> 03:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
and now I have lost my train of thought
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
and apologize
 
03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:40.070 align:start position:0%
and apologize
um

03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.170 --> 03:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
no I really have lost my train of
 
03:43:43.610 --> 03:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
thought so
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
I I will leave it there it's it's a
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
useful program for both oh and what I
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
was trying to remember was we had
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
testify testimony before the Committees
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
that not only will this benefit farmers
 
03:44:01.210 --> 03:44:01.220 align:start position:0%
markets and farm stands in the country
 
03:44:04.610 --> 03:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
but most of our urban areas have farmers
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
markets and farm stands locally like the
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
one that takes place right outside the
 
03:44:11.809 --> 03:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
Capitol Building here so they're
 
03:44:14.690 --> 03:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
accessible to far more people than just
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
those who can actually get to a Farm
 
03:44:16.380 --> 03:44:17.210 align:start position:0%
those who can actually get to a Farm
Stand

03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
Stand
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
so for all of those reasons I would ask
 
03:44:23.929 --> 03:44:23.939 align:start position:0%
you to press the green button and pass
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
this small but very significant benefit
 
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
for those who need it thank you as a
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
member of yield the questions
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
I do not remember does not yield
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:41.290 --> 03:44:41.300 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative but senate representative
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
Senator natasto has requested a roll
 
03:44:53.290 --> 03:44:53.300 align:start position:0%

if I know that this program was

discontinued because of low utilization
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we can access ten
 
03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
dollars in one-time funding without
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
contributing more than just some
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
employer time but that this bill
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
appropriates three hundred thousand
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%

twelve thousand families

get to travel around the country three
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%

I know really an exciting group um but
 
03:55:27.769 --> 03:55:27.779 align:start position:0%
they all know that we have the largest
 
03:55:30.050 --> 03:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
legislature and ask if it's unwieldily
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
or how we get along and I said it's very
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
well organized and we get a tremendous
 
03:55:36.650 --> 03:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
amount accomplished every Bill gets to
 
03:55:38.809 --> 03:55:38.819 align:start position:0%

brings to the floor
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of the New Hampshire
 
03:55:41.939 --> 03:55:43.070 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of the New Hampshire
way

03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
we get things done
 
03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily need government to
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
do it for us some examples in the state
 
03:55:52.010 --> 03:55:52.020 align:start position:0%

to wear seat belts but more of us do
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
than in states where it's required
 
03:56:00.769 --> 03:56:00.779 align:start position:0%
we don't require people to have
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
insurance but more people have it than
 
03:56:05.150 --> 03:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
in states that are not and we are the
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
only state in New England at least I
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
believe so that doesn't have a bottle
 
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill because we recycle on our own
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
so there's many things that the state of
 
03:56:13.849 --> 03:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does on their own and the
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
people do themselves
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to the minimum wage I
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
look at what business has done over the
 
03:56:21.769 --> 03:56:21.779 align:start position:0%
last number of years
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
business needs to stay in business
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
business will adapt business will change
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
and they've had to do so by increasing
 
03:56:30.359 --> 03:56:31.550 align:start position:0%
and they've had to do so by increasing
wages

03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
wages
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I think they've been very effective
 
03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
at increasing wages
 
03:56:39.010 --> 03:56:39.020 align:start position:0%
you all drive around you see a fast food
 
03:56:40.969 --> 03:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
advertising between fifteen and
 
03:56:43.010 --> 03:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
Seventeen dollars an hour the radio on
 
03:56:45.410 --> 03:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
the way up here this morning advertising
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
35 dollars an hour to be on a um
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
a Paving crew
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
and now the newest thing is work today
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
get paid tomorrow have you seen those
 
03:56:59.929 --> 03:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
advertisements so businesses will adapt
 
03:57:01.729 --> 03:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
and have done so and they brought the
 
03:57:05.630 --> 03:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.849 --> 03:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
we don't have a minimum wage here that
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
is true we follow the federal minimum
 
03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:11.689 align:start position:0%
is true we follow the federal minimum
wage

03:57:11.689 --> 03:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:57:14.150 --> 03:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
our two senators had the ability to
 
03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage in one of the
 
03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
coveted bills
 
03:57:20.750 --> 03:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
and when it came to a vote on one of the
 
03:57:23.090 --> 03:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
Amendments brought in by the senator
 
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
from Vermont
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:33.290 --> 03:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
another thing about this bill is
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
something I was taught never to do by
 
03:57:36.410 --> 03:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
some of these people in the front row
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
when I was a young in here
 
03:57:42.250 --> 03:57:42.260 align:start position:0%
never vote for something and tie another
 
03:57:44.570 --> 03:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
legislature to it
 
03:57:47.090 --> 03:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
this bill has
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
a automatic increase based on
 
03:57:50.640 --> 03:57:51.309 align:start position:0%
a automatic increase based on
the

03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:51.319 --> 03:57:53.210 align:start position:0%
the
CPI

03:57:53.210 --> 03:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
CPI
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the minimum wage
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
and the way I always taught we do not
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
tie another legislature we vote we vote
 
03:58:02.150 --> 03:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
up or down we stand behind our vote we
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
don't just let something automatically
 
03:58:03.479 --> 03:58:05.570 align:start position:0%
don't just let something automatically
happen

03:58:05.570 --> 03:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
I feel that business has done a better
 
03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
job than government could when it comes
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
to wages
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
we have one of the lowest unemployment
 
03:58:15.889 --> 03:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
where the top third of wage earners in
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
the state in the country
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't be
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
tying any automatic increase to anything
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to vote against the
 
03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:29.210 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to vote against the
motion

03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:58:32.689 --> 03:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
for a further motion thank you does a
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
I will answer one question
 
03:58:43.370 --> 03:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:58:45.960 --> 03:58:46.849 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
leave

03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
leave
 
03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
did a research for a year and a half
 
03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
looking at businesses and uh walking
 
03:58:59.150 --> 03:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
around and ask workers they still make
 
03:59:02.570 --> 03:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
some people they still making 7.25 an
 
03:59:02.580 --> 03:59:03.590 align:start position:0%
some people they still making 7.25 an
hour

03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
hour
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have a homeless
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
people they they have two to three jobs
 
03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
and they still don't make enough to pay
 
03:59:10.979 --> 03:59:12.229 align:start position:0%
and they still don't make enough to pay
rent

03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
rent
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:59:17.210 --> 03:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
can you can you play explains to me how
 
03:59:19.729 --> 03:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
else to spend for a minute so I know we
 
03:59:22.849 --> 03:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
do would you believe questions and if I
 
03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
was parliamentary God they wouldn't
 
03:59:25.929 --> 03:59:25.939 align:start position:0%
happen but
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're really stretching that you can't
 
03:59:29.469 --> 03:59:29.479 align:start position:0%
start out
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you a question
 
03:59:31.620 --> 03:59:36.650 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you a question
because

03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:39.170 --> 03:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
can I ask the question if you can ask
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
just ask the question please yes
 
03:59:42.479 --> 03:59:43.550 align:start position:0%
just ask the question please yes
um

03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
do you know how many businesses they
 
03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
they they still make it they pay in 725
 
03:59:53.150 --> 03:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
workers and we have people they they
 
03:59:56.450 --> 03:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
still work in two or three jobs and 725
 
03:59:58.729 --> 03:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
an hour and they're homeless at this
 
03:59:58.739 --> 04:00:00.830 align:start position:0%
an hour and they're homeless at this
point

04:00:00.830 --> 04:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:00:02.990 --> 04:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are still some jobs in the state
 
04:00:04.370 --> 04:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire where employers are
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
paying 7.25 they usually last for a week
 
04:00:08.809 --> 04:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
or two to make sure the employee is
 
04:00:10.969 --> 04:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
going to to at least continue to show up
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're what we call the training wage
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not going to sit here and say
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's not one person one business and
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
one employee
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
um not making 7.25 an hour I wish they
 
04:00:25.729 --> 04:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
all were making more but again some of
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
those are trading wages and others the
 
04:00:29.570 --> 04:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
made a decision themselves that they
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
weren't going to pay any of their
 
04:00:36.410 --> 04:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
employees more under 15 an hour and I'm
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of that and for those nine
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
people that had helped I'm glad it did
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
but I'm glad the city of Manchester made
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
that decision and private employers made
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:50.040 --> 04:00:51.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:00:51.530 --> 04:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
remember the member from Concord
 
04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz is recognized to
 
04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.210 --> 04:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and honorable
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm going to be
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically brief
 
04:01:07.080 --> 04:01:07.849 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically brief
um

04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:10.130 --> 04:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
I know that's kind of hard I wrote it
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
down so I would be
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
um I want to make two core points and
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's it the first one I think
 
04:01:16.319 --> 04:01:17.450 align:start position:0%
that's it the first one I think
everybody

04:01:17.450 --> 04:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
can appreciate and that's that there's
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support for the 15
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
minimum wage but among granite spaders
 
04:01:27.530 --> 04:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
and the second one is about the value of
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility and hard work
 
04:01:33.170 --> 04:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
as inspired by President Ronald Reagan
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
who I will be quoting
 
04:01:37.969 --> 04:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
and that contributing to society is is a
 
04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
Central American value
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
so first
 
04:01:44.750 --> 04:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
there is full laughter poll has shown
 
04:01:46.849 --> 04:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
that the average Granite stator
 
04:01:50.210 --> 04:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
including a majority of Republican Rank
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
and file voters in New Hampshire support
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
raising or returning a minimum wage back
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and getting to 15. this
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
has been polled after so it's not some
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
radical thing we're throwing on people
 
04:02:06.889 --> 04:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
this is actually something that if we
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
talk when we talk to our constituents we
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
can ask them and we'll find that to be
 
04:02:13.130 --> 04:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
the case
 
04:02:13.140 --> 04:02:14.389 align:start position:0%
the case
um

04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
and really I think it's because not only
 
04:02:19.729 --> 04:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
are granted Staters smart
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
um but they also see that we are on a
 
04:02:23.809 --> 04:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
path the neighbors our neighboring
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
states are on a path to get to 15 and
 
04:02:28.729 --> 04:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
some employers are on that path as as
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
our previous speaker did point to
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
right now other than New Hampshire
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
all other New England states are on a
 
04:02:41.889 --> 04:02:41.899 align:start position:0%
path to 15 and it ranges from Vermont
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
13.18 an hour to Massachusetts and
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are already at 15.
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so and also on this same point that's
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
because over a hundred and one thousand
 
04:02:57.530 --> 04:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters make less than 15 an
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
hour a hundred and one thousand granted
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
Staters that are workers make less than
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars an hour that is about 25
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
percent less than that figure was two
 
04:03:10.370 --> 04:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
years ago but it's still a lot of people
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
and probably in every one of our
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
district okay so there's there's that
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
broad point now to the Ronald Reagan
 
04:03:17.640 --> 04:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
broad point now to the Ronald Reagan
stuff

04:03:18.530 --> 04:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:03:18.540 --> 04:03:19.849 align:start position:0%
stuff
um

04:03:19.849 --> 04:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
of course Ronald Reagan spoke eloquently
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
about America being The Shining City on
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
the hill
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
and he spoke eloquently about the value
 
04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
of hard work and and how we if we're
 
04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
able-bodied and able-minded should be
 
04:03:35.450 --> 04:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
able to contribute to society and I
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
think that's a bipartisan value I really
 
04:03:40.010 --> 04:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
do but no one has more eloquently said
 
04:03:41.210 --> 04:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
this than
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
President Reagan and he said
 
04:03:46.010 --> 04:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
two quotes
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
first wouldn't it be better or the human
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
spirit and for the soul of this nation
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to accept more
 
04:03:54.720 --> 04:03:56.269 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to accept more
responsibility

04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
I agree with that and then he also says
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful work not welfare
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
is every American's hope
 
04:04:07.849 --> 04:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
and we have a continuing responsibility
 
04:04:12.769 --> 04:04:12.779 align:start position:0%
to make those hopes a lasting reality
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I agree with every
 
04:04:17.450 --> 04:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
aspect of that and yet I do agree with
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
the core message of that and that's what
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
inspires me to keep fighting this battle
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
that we have yet to succeed on
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
and that's because American society
 
04:04:29.450 --> 04:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
still holds that value we all do I
 
04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
believe probably everybody in this room
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
I believe does I really do believe that
 
04:04:35.809 --> 04:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
because if you can work
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
you should work we need you to work
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
and all jobs that need to be filled
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
should we should work to fill those jobs
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
but the minimum wage is only there as a
 
04:04:50.689 --> 04:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
floor and our floor right now is much
 
04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
much much too low when we default for
 
04:04:53.929 --> 04:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
the Federal
 
04:04:57.769 --> 04:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
seven dollars and 25 cents an hour
 
04:05:00.769 --> 04:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
it was never meant to do anything to
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
bring broad prosperity to everybody it
 
04:05:04.969 --> 04:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
was just meant to keep people out of
 
04:05:06.530 --> 04:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
dire poverty
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
but we know workers in New Hampshire at
 
04:05:11.570 --> 04:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
a much higher rate than any of us would
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
like have to go on public assistance
 
04:05:17.210 --> 04:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
while working full-time because too many
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
employers pay such a low wage that they
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
have no other recourse
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
if they want to raise children if they
 
04:05:26.570 --> 04:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
want to participate in society and
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing everything that Society is
 
04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
asking of them they are not looking for
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
a handout
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
it is up to us and our responsibility to
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
low-wage Granite Staters do not have to
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
go on public assistance
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
let me say that again
 
04:05:47.210 --> 04:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
they're paid so low that they have to go
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
on public assistance and that is not
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
what it's for
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
both social safety nets are for people
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
who cannot work people who are sick
 
04:05:59.689 --> 04:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
people who are too young or too old to
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
work or have a disability that causes
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
them to not be able to work
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
none of that none of our social safety
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
nets were to be a way to augment wages
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
because an employer can hit the floor or
 
04:06:15.889 --> 04:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
close to the floor of the wage or the
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
moreover in terms of prosperity
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
every dollar that'll that a lower wage
 
04:06:25.010 --> 04:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
worker earns ends up back in this
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
economy I think that's true of most
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
middle class families do it's a rising
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
tide that lifts all boats
 
04:06:35.809 --> 04:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
for people earning low wages and for A
 
04:06:38.090 --> 04:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hard Day's Work all they really are
 
04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
asking for is that fair wage
 
04:06:43.130 --> 04:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
and we need to ensure that it happened
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
because again none of them wants a
 
04:06:46.020 --> 04:06:46.849 align:start position:0%
because again none of them wants a
handout

04:06:46.849 --> 04:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
I come from a family of hard workers I'm
 
04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
sure given that we do this as volunteers
 
04:06:55.250 --> 04:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
I bet we all come from families that are
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
hard workers and again no worker wants a
 
04:06:57.720 --> 04:06:58.910 align:start position:0%
hard workers and again no worker wants a
handout

04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
so for that modest
 
04:07:04.370 --> 04:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
um for their hard work they deserve that
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
modest pay as a means of contributing to
 
04:07:10.130 --> 04:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
society and we need to do the right
 
04:07:12.769 --> 04:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
thing and raise that floor at least to
 
04:07:14.570 --> 04:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
the minimum of what our neighbors are
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
going towards and that's what the first
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
step of this bill would do
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm skipping over a lot of points to
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
keep it brief
 
04:07:22.620 --> 04:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
keep it brief
um

04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
okay for me for me okay in all fairness
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that you will
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
um support this bill by
 
04:07:34.620 --> 04:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
um support this bill by
um

04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
what is the motion ought to pass good
 
04:07:37.500 --> 04:07:38.929 align:start position:0%
what is the motion ought to pass good
okay

04:07:38.929 --> 04:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um please vote to pass this bill by uh
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
choosing The Color of Money the green
 
04:07:51.290 --> 04:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.630 --> 04:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative santanostaza requests a
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
04:07:56.160 --> 04:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
foreign

04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.210 --> 04:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote member
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.359 --> 04:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth is recognized
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
know that increasing the minimum wage
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
every year for well forever is bad
 
04:09:40.849 --> 04:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
policy for New Hampshire and if I heard
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
that it's very similar legislation just
 
04:09:45.769 --> 04:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
got voted down on the other side of the
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
wall would I not press the red button to
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
defeat this motion so a better motion
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan is recognized
 
04:09:59.650 --> 04:09:59.660 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary incorrect
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that New Hampshire
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
has no minimum wage but follows the
 
04:10:12.010 --> 04:10:12.020 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage of 7.25 an hour
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
and if I also know
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
that all
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
all the other New England states are
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
well on their way towards a 15 minimum
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
wage if not already there
 
04:10:28.969 --> 04:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
if I further know that HP 57 would store
 
04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire minimum wage in between
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
two at fifteen dollars over 50 over
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
three years would I then hit the green
 
04:10:40.130 --> 04:10:40.140 align:start position:0%

as we all know business owners provide
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
benefits to their employees for a
 
04:16:08.150 --> 04:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism to entice them to come to work

uh vacations sick time benefits these
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
are all very laudable things
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of the hard things in the labor
 
04:16:22.800 --> 04:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
one of the hard things in the labor
committee

04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:16:26.150 --> 04:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
is trying to make a law that fits
 
04:16:26.160 --> 04:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
is trying to make a law that fits
everyone

04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:16:29.929 --> 04:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
sometimes unfortunately it ends up not
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
fitting anyone
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
because we have businesses of all shapes
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
and sizes
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
large multinational companies large New
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based and New Hampshire owned
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
companies medium companies small
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
companies startups research and
 
04:16:46.849 --> 04:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
development all kinds of different
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
things where people have one employee
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
two employees
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it's very difficult to try to set
 
04:16:53.929 --> 04:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
everything into one little package
 
04:16:57.050 --> 04:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't always work out very
 
04:16:57.060 --> 04:16:59.570 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't always work out very
well

04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have tried our best over the years in
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
the labor committee
 
04:17:08.210 --> 04:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
to let businesses make some of their own
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
decisions on how they're going to
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
offer benefits
 
04:17:17.929 --> 04:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
some offer vacation time sick pay some
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't even call it that they call it pay
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
time off it's a certain number of hours
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
you can use it how you see fit
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
for vacation if you need extra sick time
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
so trying to put everything into that
 
04:17:34.689 --> 04:17:34.699 align:start position:0%
one little package and tell everybody
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do something
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to offer vacation
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
time sick time and then if there's any
 
04:17:44.689 --> 04:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
kind of departure
 
04:17:48.530 --> 04:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
get fired quit and he's then you must
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
now take those benefits that you gave
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
and pay cash on the barrelhead right now
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
within seven days just like its wages
 
04:17:58.729 --> 04:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
well some employers don't consider them
 
04:18:01.130 --> 04:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
as wages
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to provide these to you and I
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
hope you will stay employed with me
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to come to work and
 
04:18:08.160 --> 04:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to come to work and
then

04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
like some some businesses will decide in
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
their their manual yes we will pay you
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
that on a pro rata basis
 
04:18:17.689 --> 04:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time so if you do
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
leave our employment doesn't cease
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
you get a certain program of those
 
04:18:21.840 --> 04:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
you get a certain program of those
benefits

04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:18:25.610 --> 04:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
others say no because we have seasonal
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
businesses we have businesses that are
 
04:18:29.570 --> 04:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
just busy on weekends versus during the
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
week it's all kinds of different
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
machinations of what businesses do those
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
owners make the decisions on how that's
 
04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to affect them we've heard horror
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
stories about people saying I'll give
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
you two weeks paid vacation they work
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
five days into the new year and then
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
they want their two weeks paid vacation
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
that's why we allow businesses to make
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
some of these decisions on their own
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
so while I I do respect the sponsor of
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
this bill for trying to do something I
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
think he's just tried to make it too
 
04:18:58.729 --> 04:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
narrow he's trying to tell too many
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
businesses what to do it and I don't
 
04:19:02.809 --> 04:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
think it's our decision
 
04:19:05.090 --> 04:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
to tell businesses how to do this so I
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to vote against the
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%

04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
a little different because you know
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
you've done well with the company but
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason you're moving on to
 
04:19:58.010 --> 04:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
maybe you're relocating you're doing
 
04:20:01.010 --> 04:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
something else and you know you're
 
04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
giving your notice so that that your
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
boss can find a replacement maybe you've
 
04:20:07.729 --> 04:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
even helped training that person you're
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
leading on good terms you weren't fired
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're living on good terms
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
over here I'm sorry I've sold the
 
04:20:15.600 --> 04:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
over here I'm sorry I've sold the
business

04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
and I've sold the business and while
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's customary and you might expect
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
recently expect that if you're you're
 
04:20:25.490 --> 04:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
staying on you're going to work for that
 
04:20:27.710 --> 04:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
company and your hours your vacation
 
04:20:29.689 --> 04:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
hours will travel with you
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's not happening because
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I'm allowed to say
 
04:20:38.090 --> 04:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
we don't pay vacation hours at
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
termination it doesn't matter it doesn't
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
matter you're a good employee that's not
 
04:20:44.570 --> 04:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
your fault it's beyond your control it
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter in New Hampshire
 
04:20:48.769 --> 04:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's what I can do it so I'm going to
 
04:20:49.610 --> 04:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
and you know when when you interviewed
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
for the job and I said you know this is
 
04:20:55.490 --> 04:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
how much I'm going to pay you we had
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance we have you know two
 
04:21:00.170 --> 04:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
weeks vacation and uh
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
and here here's the Personnel matter
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
policy book and you probably didn't read
 
04:21:07.370 --> 04:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
it because who does who reads those you
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
know terms and conditions but down the
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
bottom and there's some place that said
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
this little this little blurb we don't
 
04:21:16.729 --> 04:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
pay upon termination
 
04:21:18.889 --> 04:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't happen to think it's
 
04:21:21.969 --> 04:21:21.979 align:start position:0%
fair that under the circumstances I've
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
outlined I'm you you're laid off you get
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
you worked hard you gave you notice did
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
everything the employer ever asked you
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
to do and probably a bit more
 
04:21:32.929 --> 04:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at that final
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
pay stub
 
04:21:36.110 --> 04:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
you're comparing it with your last one
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
something is missing and that's your
 
04:21:39.889 --> 04:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
vacation hours whether you call it PTO
 
04:21:42.410 --> 04:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
vacation whatever it was called it's
 
04:21:42.420 --> 04:21:43.790 align:start position:0%
vacation whatever it was called it's
gone

04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
gone
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to go down to the
 
04:21:46.729 --> 04:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
unemployment office and you're going to
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
say I I my job is over and uh I'm gonna
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to get by with uh 60 sorry 30 of
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
what I was making up to a maximum for
 
04:21:57.960 --> 04:21:59.570 align:start position:0%
what I was making up to a maximum for
427

04:21:59.570 --> 04:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
427
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I'm gonna that's what I
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
have to do because I didn't get my
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
vacation pay
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
and the vacation pay you know maybe you
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
have three to five thousand dollars
 
04:22:11.450 --> 04:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
saved up to pay your mortgage your your
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
rent or your food expenses and maybe you
 
04:22:13.800 --> 04:22:14.510 align:start position:0%
rent or your food expenses and maybe you
don't

04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
but having that vacation pay would
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
certainly make a difference
 
04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to tell you now that um
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the employer should wipe out this
 
04:22:28.370 --> 04:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
item from his from his balance sheet put
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
the money in his pocket
 
04:22:36.530 --> 04:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr libertarian so uh so I
 
04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
would like you to vote
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill so we can
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
move it to the other body and we'll see
 
04:22:46.729 --> 04:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
what kind of rationale they have I think
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
I want you to remember that you vote
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
that you represent not only the
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
businesses in your community you work
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
you represent the workers in your
 
04:22:53.040 --> 04:22:53.870 align:start position:0%
you represent the workers in your
community

04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
and if we don't pass this at some point
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
somebody working in your community will
 
04:23:00.530 --> 04:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
come to you and say you know I called
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the labor board and they say That's the
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Law that's the law and you had a chance
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to change it why didn't you change it
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.689 --> 04:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Santa nostalto has
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
required seconds
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 74. representative
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
infantshine is recognized for
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
if I know that one size fits all rarely
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
fits anyone
 
04:24:32.809 --> 04:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
and the businesses have the ability
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
to determine what their benefits are and
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
how they're going to allot them
 
04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the size and scope of
 
04:24:40.729 --> 04:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
their business would I please vote
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
against the motion on the floor for a
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's recognized for
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
if I know that many New Hampshire
 
04:25:00.530 --> 04:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
employers do pay for earned vacation
 
04:25:02.929 --> 04:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
time on termination
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
but if I also know
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire employers are allowed
 
04:25:10.250 --> 04:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
to take a pass on paying for that unused
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
vacation time when employee is laid off
 
04:25:17.570 --> 04:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
generated in good standing or if the
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
company is sold
 
04:25:23.929 --> 04:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
if I also know that HB 74 will require
 
04:25:26.809 --> 04:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
all employers to pay for that earned
 
04:25:28.130 --> 04:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
04:25:30.889 --> 04:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
in such circumstances
 
04:25:33.889 --> 04:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
would I then press the green button in
 
04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%

04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill establishes a
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
county tourism grant program to be used
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%

tourism initiatives
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee feels that
 
04:31:25.490 --> 04:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
this legislation is unnecessary for a
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
number of reasons first currently there
 
04:31:31.490 --> 04:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
exists two initiatives the travel and
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
tourism Development Fund and the joint
 
04:31:37.729 --> 04:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
operational program both administered by
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Business
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs for the purpose of
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
promoting and developing tourism travel
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%

second
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
the website
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
visitnewhampshire.org.gov produced by
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
these existing authorities already does
 
04:32:01.849 --> 04:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of showcasing travel
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
and tourism across the entire Granite
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
State including destinations in all 10
 
04:32:10.250 --> 04:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire counties
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill is not needed as
 
04:32:16.370 --> 04:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
tourism and travel is already well
 
04:32:19.370 --> 04:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
funded and promoted by the state of New

Hampshire
 
04:32:24.070 --> 04:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill grows government
 
04:32:27.729 --> 04:32:27.739 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and it fails to justify
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
expenditures against measurable benefits
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge my fellow
 
04:32:35.929 --> 04:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support the committee
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%

Department of Environmental Services
 
04:43:19.730 --> 04:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to vote against this bill
 
04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
for two reasons number one New Hampshire
 
04:43:24.770 --> 04:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
is no longer in a drought
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
the good news is that according to both
 
04:43:31.730 --> 04:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh Haley the point from WMUR and the U.S
 
04:43:34.128 --> 04:43:34.138 align:start position:0%
drought monitor report New Hampshire has
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
been 100 drought-free since January
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
returning us to replenishment levels not
 
04:43:43.250 --> 04:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
seen since 2020 and following a trend of
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
improvement since the fall of last year
 
04:43:47.690 --> 04:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
additionally New Hampshire should
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate being drought-free all the
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
way through early June according to data
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%

fund
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
number two
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
second reason to vote against this bill
 
04:44:08.810 --> 04:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't fit into the stated
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
mission of Des
 
04:44:13.128 --> 04:44:13.138 align:start position:0%

goals of the agency
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
is a stated mission for Des and at this
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
they do a great job
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
the Water Division is tasked with
 
04:44:25.970 --> 04:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
protecting our numerous lakes ponds
 
04:44:28.128 --> 04:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
rivers and groundwater according to
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
their website
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
but the administration of a welfare

program such as this water assistance
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
program is an expansion of their mission
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
and introduces a new kind of welfare
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
help is already available from
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
traditional welfare departments an
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%

04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
through their Town welfare department
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
additionally extra funds are available
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
through Elder services for those who
 
04:44:58.850 --> 04:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
qualify our community action programs
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
that already oversee utility emergency
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
services would be a more suitable
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
program for the administration of

we have had more frequent storms that
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%

gorgeous
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire may be going into its
 
04:45:55.730 --> 04:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
fourth drought in four years and we must
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
wait to see if that happens again
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
when a homeowner loses the use of their
 
04:46:04.010 --> 04:46:04.020 align:start position:0%

the problem
 
04:46:13.310 --> 04:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
the cost and the logistics of replacing

a well in an emergency can be
 
04:46:15.180 --> 04:46:17.570 align:start position:0%
a well in an emergency can be
prohibitive

04:46:17.570 --> 04:46:17.580 align:start position:0%

04:46:19.970 --> 04:46:19.980 align:start position:0%

the trust fund however is not able to
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
replenish funds for this well-documented
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
need one that is coming to us year after
 
04:46:58.368 --> 04:46:58.378 align:start position:0%
year since the fund was created
 
04:47:01.490 --> 04:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it creates a
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
dedicated long non-lapsing fund called
 
04:47:07.010 --> 04:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
the water assistance for national
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
disasters fund and it appropriates two
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars for the
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending in 2024
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
and two and a half million dollars for
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year ending in 2025
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
as it is written
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
from this program private well owners
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to apply for assistance in
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
the form of a loan or a grant via Des so
 
04:47:32.448 --> 04:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
that in the event of a natural disaster
 
04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
they will be able to replace replayer or
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
treat their well as needed the loans and
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
grants are based on the ability to pay
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
the income guidelines are not fixed it
 
04:47:48.890 --> 04:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
is Rule making Authority that Des has in
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
order to to assist with this money and
 
04:47:56.208 --> 04:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
they will be using a process that is
 
04:47:59.090 --> 04:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
already in existence
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
Des may also apply for and accept from
 
04:48:05.690 --> 04:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
any source
 
04:48:09.128 --> 04:48:09.138 align:start position:0%
gifts donations of money federal grants
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislative Appropriations local
 
04:48:14.990 --> 04:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
and other
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
matching funds that that also
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
can be deposited into this dedicated and
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
 
04:48:26.448 --> 04:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
so I leave you just with the comment
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
that Equitable access to clean water
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
is something that will benefit all
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and I hope that you will
 
04:48:37.368 --> 04:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the bill please push
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:49:52.490 --> 04:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the majority
 
04:49:55.368 --> 04:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
rejected a proposal to study how this
 
04:49:57.170 --> 04:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
bill would fit into other available
 
04:50:00.288 --> 04:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
programs such as federal aid or
 
04:50:03.050 --> 04:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
emergency welfare Aid that may be
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
presently available to assure drinking
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
water for our taxpayers
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%

provide water assistance for natural
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
disasters yet the bill itself reveals a
 
04:50:17.810 --> 04:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
plan to spend five million dollars to
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
repair and replace Wells only for a
 
04:50:23.810 --> 04:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
select group of our taxpayers
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
and if I know that a natural disaster in
 
04:50:29.208 --> 04:50:29.218 align:start position:0%
a natural disaster all New Hampshire
 
04:50:32.208 --> 04:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
taxpayers should be treated equally
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak in support of
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 108. uh this bill is would
 
04:54:52.610 --> 04:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
attach a penalty to uh people who are
 
04:54:56.090 --> 04:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
making a report in bad faith keep that
 
04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
in mind in bad faith to dcyf I'm a
 
04:55:03.530 --> 04:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter all adults in New
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are mandated reporters all you
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
need is a suspicion of abuse or neglect
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
to make a report in good faith
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between making a
 
04:55:18.170 --> 04:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
report in good faith or in bad faith
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is not going to penalize people who
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
are making a report in good faith the
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
determination of if it's a good faith
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
report or if it's a bad faith report is
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
done through dcyf that is that is on
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
them to determine
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
if it's a bad faith report or not it
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
takes a lot there's a high bar for them
 
04:55:47.690 --> 04:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
to determine without a shadow of a doubt
 
04:55:50.170 --> 04:55:50.180 align:start position:0%
um if the report was made in bad faith
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
50 states and territories have similar
 
04:55:58.610 --> 04:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
bills uh similar laws uh to this on
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
their on the record
 
04:56:03.890 --> 04:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I am in support of this because I
 
04:56:07.730 --> 04:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
think that by having similar legislation
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
done here it will deter people who are
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
making bad faith reports it should not
 
04:56:16.610 --> 04:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill is not to
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
deter good faith reporting
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
it is to deter the bad faith reporting
 
04:56:24.410 --> 04:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
if they know that there's going to be
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties attached they might
 
04:56:29.570 --> 04:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
not make that report but people who are
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
still making a report in good faith have
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to worry about I am in support
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill if you feel the same then
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.050 --> 04:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition
 
04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
to this idea
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
this is about child abuse neglect and
 
04:57:02.570 --> 04:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
about reporting as the young lady told
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
us that every one of us needs to report
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
this think about what happens
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
when people think that they might be
 
04:57:09.240 --> 04:57:11.208 align:start position:0%
when people think that they might be
prosecuted

04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
04:57:13.010 --> 04:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
you don't know what happens after you've
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
made a report it's you it's not
 
04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh in the public domain right criminal
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
cases are so you make a report that
 
04:57:23.570 --> 04:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
something's happening next door down the
 
04:57:25.610 --> 04:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
street wherever teachers have to do this
 
04:57:28.010 --> 04:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
quite often you can do it confidentially
 
04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
but the thing is it's confidential
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
afterwards so you don't know the next
 
04:57:32.100 --> 04:57:32.868 align:start position:0%
afterwards so you don't know the next
time

04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
you make a report whether anything
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
happened or not and so you may make a
 
04:57:40.010 --> 04:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
series of reports and then suddenly
 
04:57:44.030 --> 04:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
somebody decides at dcyf that well I
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
think we're getting too many reports
 
04:57:47.570 --> 04:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
but you were told you were supposed to
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
make reports just on suspicion
 
04:57:53.330 --> 04:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
we all remember what happened
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
with the Roman Catholic Church when many
 
04:57:58.368 --> 04:57:58.378 align:start position:0%
of us were afraid to make reports
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
because of the authority
 
04:58:03.890 --> 04:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's important to get those reports out
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and not suppress the free speech of
 
04:58:09.650 --> 04:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
the public that would make those uh
 
04:58:12.250 --> 04:58:12.260 align:start position:0%
reports just recently we had a child die
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
in uh I think it was Manchester oh lice
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody did report that
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
but those are the sort of things we
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
desperately need people to report to
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
dcyf which Division of Youth children
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
and families and so that they can
 
04:58:29.448 --> 04:58:29.458 align:start position:0%
investigate those things
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to know if they have bad
 
04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
faith or not it's up to them to
 
04:58:36.170 --> 04:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
um to sort that out
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
we we just want those reports to come in
 
04:58:40.610 --> 04:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
we've been that way for many years ever
 
04:58:43.368 --> 04:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
since we went to this chapter and we
 
04:58:43.378 --> 04:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
since we went to this chapter and we
thought

04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
this outweighs not Prosecuting people
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
not letting them think that they might
 
04:58:53.690 --> 04:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
become uh uh a suspect they have to go
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
before court
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to think that they'll
 
04:59:00.170 --> 04:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
get their mug shot just for reporting
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
innocently just
 
04:59:02.820 --> 04:59:05.208 align:start position:0%
innocently just
yes

04:59:05.208 --> 04:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
yes just you could make an innocent
 
04:59:09.770 --> 04:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
report and be suspect
 
04:59:12.410 --> 04:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
and if you're suspect you can be
 
04:59:12.420 --> 04:59:13.730 align:start position:0%
and if you're suspect you can be
prosecuted

04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
a mug shot
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
and that's why we didn't want to go this
 
04:59:20.090 --> 04:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
direction we want people to feel free
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to hire a defense
 
04:59:23.570 --> 04:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
attorney it's going to cost you daily
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
and when the word gets out
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
people are not going to freely report
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to rain it in they're going
 
04:59:31.610 --> 04:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
to back off
 
04:59:33.770 --> 04:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're afraid of doing so
 
04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you to not support the
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill as it is
 
04:59:40.730 --> 04:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
first the red button so that we can
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
continue on in New Hampshire the way we
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
have we've done a pretty good job
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
but we can do better
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
and if we go this way
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah recognizing representative Mark
 
04:59:55.320 --> 04:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
yeah recognizing representative Mark
Pearson

04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
um several of the points I was going to
 
05:00:06.530 --> 05:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
make were actually made better by my
 
05:00:09.650 --> 05:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
colleagues so I'll skip some points and
 
05:00:11.330 --> 05:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
just say a few things
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
over the years some people I've been
 
05:00:15.288 --> 05:00:15.298 align:start position:0%
charged with looking after
 
05:00:17.690 --> 05:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
have been the victims of a disgruntled
 
05:00:19.850 --> 05:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse using his or her children to
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
get revenge by making intentionally
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
false reports of child abuse to the
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
relevant Department Court law
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency or Social Service
 
05:00:33.288 --> 05:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
Agency the bill before us would add
 
05:00:36.170 --> 05:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
finally New Hampshire to the long list
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
of states and territories that say you
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
do that and you'll be punished for it
 
05:00:44.090 --> 05:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
the statutes in these and other
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions all include such phrases
 
05:00:50.448 --> 05:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
as knowingly and willfully
 
05:00:52.550 --> 05:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
makes a false report
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
another state says the person knew that
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
the report was false or was made with
 
05:01:00.288 --> 05:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
Reckless disregard of the truth or
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
falsity of the report in other words an
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
honest mistake is not punished
 
05:01:07.610 --> 05:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
the question was raised as to whether
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
the addition of this law would have a
 
05:01:12.530 --> 05:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
deleterious effect on honest sincere
 
05:01:15.170 --> 05:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
reporting those consulted in other
 
05:01:18.288 --> 05:01:18.298 align:start position:0%
states tell us they do not believe their
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
laws had that effect
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
therefore out of an abundance of caution
 
05:01:25.730 --> 05:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
the bill before us specifically adds a
 
05:01:25.740 --> 05:01:26.770 align:start position:0%
the bill before us specifically adds a
section

05:01:26.770 --> 05:01:26.780 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
indemnifying those who make a good faith
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
but inaccurate report
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker let's take one weapon out of
 
05:01:37.610 --> 05:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
the hands of those who would use their
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
children to Strike Back At a next spouse
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.530 --> 05:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
05:01:50.090 --> 05:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee report of want to pass on
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
05:01:57.770 --> 05:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the majority
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
committee report of water pass on House
 
05:03:45.410 --> 05:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 108. this is a division vote
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
if I know that this body has the safety
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
and well-being of children as a priority
 
05:04:04.570 --> 05:04:04.580 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill could deter
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
conscientious citizens for making a
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
pertinent call to protect children and
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
if I also know that there is already
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
legal recourse for defamation and
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
slander would I now press the red button
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
and vote no on deterring calls to report
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
potential abuse or neck or neglect thank
 
05:04:22.798 --> 05:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
potential abuse or neck or neglect thank
you

05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%

05:04:25.850 --> 05:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
Geo recognized from Senator Pearson for
 
05:04:29.090 --> 05:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the penalty is
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
for making a false report of child abuse
 
05:04:36.890 --> 05:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
are on the books in the vast majority of
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
States but not yet New Hampshire
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
and if I know that those who make a good
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
face but inaccurate report are
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
indemnified in this bill
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that laws like the
 
05:04:51.770 --> 05:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
one under consideration have not led to
 
05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
people being afraid to make reports when
 
05:04:57.050 --> 05:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
necessary would I vote ought to pass by

05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this is the simple
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill that codifies state law and
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
clarifies it under state law anyone can
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
be in public without a shirt or top and
 
05:14:03.410 --> 05:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
is not illegal if you go to Hampton
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
Beach during the summer you will see
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
many men out there without a shirt on
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
you will also see some women without a
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
top on there have been no issues I would
 
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
suggest if someone is harassing people
 
05:14:15.890 --> 05:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
that the harasser is the person who
 
05:14:18.050 --> 05:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
should be held responsible and not the
 
05:14:18.060 --> 05:14:19.128 align:start position:0%
should be held responsible and not the
victim

05:14:19.128 --> 05:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
victim
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
we're in spite of state law allowing
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
this the City of Laconia has an
 
05:14:26.208 --> 05:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
ordinance preventing it now I took that
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
ordinance challenged it to the New
 
05:14:29.448 --> 05:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court on equal
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
protection grounds because Laconia
 
05:14:33.410 --> 05:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
ordinance said men can be outside
 
05:14:35.690 --> 05:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
without a shirt on but women can be
 
05:14:38.810 --> 05:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
cannot unfortunately I lost that Supreme
 
05:14:41.570 --> 05:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
Court decision by a vote of three to two
 
05:14:43.250 --> 05:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
um further evidence that every vote
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
counts uh we know that by some of the
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
ties here today
 
05:14:49.128 --> 05:14:49.138 align:start position:0%
but I'd suggest uh we can overrule that
 
05:14:51.410 --> 05:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire is a Dillon State not a
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
home rule state what that means is towns
 
05:14:55.730 --> 05:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
and cities can only do what the state
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
gives them permission to do and the
 
05:14:59.810 --> 05:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
state can preempt the town and we do
 
05:15:02.690 --> 05:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
this in many areas I expect half of the
 
05:15:05.448 --> 05:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
room here is proud that we preempt towns
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
on firearm laws and don't let towns
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
regulate that and the other half of the
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
room I would suspect if there was a bill
 
05:15:14.448 --> 05:15:14.458 align:start position:0%
that prevented towns from Banning
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
abortions at any moment in time that
 
05:15:18.830 --> 05:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
that might be something that people
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
would also be in favor of
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
so depending on the issue there are many
 
05:15:25.490 --> 05:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
examples where we do not allow towns to
 
05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
do what we want what they want there's a
 
05:15:30.170 --> 05:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
minimum floor that this legislative body
 
05:15:30.180 --> 05:15:32.150 align:start position:0%
minimum floor that this legislative body
sets

05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
sets
 
05:15:35.330 --> 05:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and so when there are enabling bills
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
um that allows towns to do something we
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
can say no you cannot do that and I
 
05:15:42.530 --> 05:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
would suggest that our enabling statutes
 
05:15:44.690 --> 05:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
do say that towns cannot do things that
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
are repugnant to the Constitution as
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
suggest it is repugnant to the
 
05:15:50.930 --> 05:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution to make a crime help an
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
element based on someone's sex we would
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
not even hopefully consider ever having
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
a crime that has an element someone's
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
race and I would suggest it's just as
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
wrong to do it when it's based on
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:09.650 --> 05:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's testimony
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
against this in the committee however
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the nhma
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
um didn't take a position as to towns
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
doing it in discriminatory fashion
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
um but their concern was well what if
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
towns don't want people or what if towns
 
05:16:27.890 --> 05:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
want to require shirts in town hall or
 
05:16:30.288 --> 05:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
Library I think that makes sense um Town
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that if they want
 
05:16:35.090 --> 05:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so my position is solely when towns
 
05:16:36.770 --> 05:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
are doing it in a discriminatory fashion
 
05:16:40.610 --> 05:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
based on someone's sex so I'd ask that
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
you vote against the itl so that a
 
05:16:46.970 --> 05:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
additional language that has been
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
presented we can Abode that which would
 
05:16:50.470 --> 05:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
address that
 
05:16:53.208 --> 05:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say freedom should
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
not depend on someone's sex whether Live
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State we're not to live for
 
05:16:59.090 --> 05:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
your diet unless you're a female State
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:09.890 --> 05:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
the committee voted on this
 
05:17:18.170 --> 05:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
we thought about it it's
 
05:17:20.090 --> 05:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult one but at the end of
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
the day we came down on the position of
 
05:17:25.610 --> 05:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
what is going on at the moment in a
 
05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular town is something that we
 
05:17:30.170 --> 05:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
cannot foresee or interfere in if the
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
citizens of Laconia they have bike week
 
05:17:34.970 --> 05:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
they have different events
 
05:17:37.670 --> 05:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
they as a citizenry decide that this is
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
what's best for our town at this
 
05:17:42.170 --> 05:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
particular moment in the safety of our
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
town they decided that was the way they
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to go this is not something that
 
05:17:48.288 --> 05:17:48.298 align:start position:0%
we feel we should micromanage towns on
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
other issues as the previous speaker
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
said are more important this one really
 
05:17:58.128 --> 05:17:58.138 align:start position:0%
it's just I guess I would say that it's
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
a difficult one for us to get involved
 
05:18:02.330 --> 05:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
in at the state level because different
 
05:18:03.650 --> 05:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
towns have different events all
 
05:18:05.448 --> 05:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so I would ask you
 
05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
to support the bipartisan committee vote
 
05:18:10.910 --> 05:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
to let the towns deal with this in the
 
05:18:13.850 --> 05:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
best way they see fit thank you
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative Reed has requested
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is majority
 
05:19:11.690 --> 05:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexped into
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%

05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 160. this is a division
 
05:19:18.000 --> 05:19:19.070 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 160. this is a division
vote

05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:19:21.050 --> 05:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Reed
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
know the definition of crime should not
 
05:19:32.330 --> 05:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
be based upon a person's sex and if I
 
05:19:34.250 --> 05:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
know that display of chest is already
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
legal under state law but towns have
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
passed ordinances that are
 
05:19:39.770 --> 05:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
discriminatory on the basis of sex
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
providing unequal treatment of the Sexes
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
under the law meaning that I could be
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
arrested for the same exact behavior
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
that would be completely illegal for you
 
05:19:51.530 --> 05:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker and if I know that the
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
municipal Association actor Consulting
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
thank you if I know that the municipal
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
Association after Consulting the towns
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
that have passed the discriminatory
 
05:20:05.208 --> 05:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
ordinances were fine with the idea of
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature prohibiting towns from
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
passing discriminatory ordinances on the
 
05:20:12.170 --> 05:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
basis of sex and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
know that the prime sponsor intends to
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
bring forward floor amendment that
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
simply states that towns cannot pass
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances that discriminate on the
 
05:20:21.770 --> 05:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
basis of sex effectively solving the
 
05:20:23.810 --> 05:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
concerns the committee members had then
 
05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl so that the floor
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment can be brought forward and we
 
05:20:31.550 --> 05:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
can end the unequal treatment of the de
 
05:20:33.890 --> 05:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
Sexes under the law
 
05:20:35.930 --> 05:20:35.940 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
HP 191 is a pretty simple bill that
 
05:23:44.570 --> 05:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
gives the department of safety uh the
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
option that's the option of offering a
 
05:23:50.208 --> 05:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
firearm surrender and Destroy program
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
for gun owners
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
it recognizes the fact that there are
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
some gun owners who may have inherited a
 
05:23:59.810 --> 05:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
firearm a required one uh at some point
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
who may not feel comfortable with one in
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
the house or who may have inherited it
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
from a family member and would rather
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
have it destroyed
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
the bill would change but not eliminate
 
05:24:11.690 --> 05:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
a law passed 25 years ago that lets
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
State Police accept weapons that are
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
turned in by owners who no longer want
 
05:24:15.600 --> 05:24:16.610 align:start position:0%
turned in by owners who no longer want
them

05:24:16.610 --> 05:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:24:18.530 --> 05:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
currently when these weapons get turned
 
05:24:21.050 --> 05:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
in they're either auctioned off or the
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
state police can decide to keep them but
 
05:24:25.610 --> 05:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
what a current law does not do is give
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
the state police the option the option
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
again and not the mandate to do what
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
some gun owners choose to do with their
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
own property and that is to Simply have
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
it destroyed
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
in theory gun owners have the right to
 
05:24:42.530 --> 05:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
destroy their property on their own
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
while some might have access to a
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
shredder capable of shredding paper very
 
05:24:51.170 --> 05:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
few people have access to the kind of
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
Shredder that's uh necessary to actually
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
shred a firearm or the kind of saw
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's powerful enough to cut a firearm
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
up so it's no longer workable or an
 
05:25:06.288 --> 05:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
oxyacetylene torch capable of melting
 
05:25:08.810 --> 05:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
one enough in enough of the right places
 
05:25:11.330 --> 05:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
to render it inoperable
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
State Police are already incurring the
 
05:25:15.530 --> 05:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
expense of accepting turned in weapons
 
05:25:18.288 --> 05:25:18.298 align:start position:0%
and deciding how to dispose of them all
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
the bill does that's in front of us now
 
05:25:21.770 --> 05:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
is give the state police another option
 
05:25:23.930 --> 05:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
for disposing of them while at the same
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
time giving a few people who would like
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be ex-gun owners the comfort of
 
05:25:29.930 --> 05:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
knowing that a weapon that once belonged
 
05:25:31.610 --> 05:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
to them will never be in a position to
 
05:25:34.490 --> 05:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
be used in an act of violence or to help
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
a person take their own life
 
05:25:40.970 --> 05:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is this bill only adds
 
05:25:43.930 --> 05:25:43.940 align:start position:0%
an option it's not a mandate
 
05:25:46.250 --> 05:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
some people might make the argument that
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
criminals might take advantage of the
 
05:25:50.448 --> 05:25:50.458 align:start position:0%
program to have a crime gun destroyed
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
but to me you actually have to be a
 
05:25:56.448 --> 05:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
pretty dumb criminal to risk an
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
unnecessary encounter with police over
 
05:26:01.550 --> 05:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
um what's also important to realize is
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
that allowing the state police to
 
05:26:07.368 --> 05:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
provide this option is no more costly
 
05:26:09.708 --> 05:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
than administering the options that we
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
already provide there are also companies
 
05:26:14.930 --> 05:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
out there like gun Busters that will
 
05:26:18.050 --> 05:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
actually work with law enforcement to
 
05:26:20.510 --> 05:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
destroy weapons for law enforcement at
 
05:26:24.410 --> 05:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
no charge so please please support me in
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
supporting a bill that actually supports
 
05:26:30.050 --> 05:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
the rights of people who own property to
 
05:26:33.170 --> 05:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
decide how that property can and should
 
05:26:36.530 --> 05:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
be disposed of again this is a bill that
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
does not require the state police to
 
05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
implement this program it merely would
 
05:26:43.970 --> 05:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
give them the option of doing it thank
 
05:26:43.980 --> 05:26:45.948 align:start position:0%
give them the option of doing it thank
you

05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Roy
 
05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker we heard
 
05:26:53.448 --> 05:26:53.458 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill from the state
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
police the state police are the ones who
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
brought up the idea that it could
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
possibly be
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
um The Perfect Crime if you use a gun
 
05:27:03.890 --> 05:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
you bring it into the state police and
 
05:27:05.930 --> 05:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
they destroy it for you well there goes
 
05:27:06.970 --> 05:27:06.980 align:start position:0%
the case
 
05:27:09.650 --> 05:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
as often or not as that may happen it's
 
05:27:11.208 --> 05:27:11.218 align:start position:0%
not as important as the fact that
 
05:27:13.730 --> 05:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
destroying perfectly good property that
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
can be converted to money for the town
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
or the city or the state is the reason
 
05:27:19.550 --> 05:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
this law was put in place in the first
 
05:27:22.010 --> 05:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
place if a citizen wants their firearm
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
destroyed rather than sold they just
 
05:27:26.948 --> 05:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
want it out of commission any number of
 
05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
gunsmiths in the state would be happy to
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
do it for a very small fee as much as it
 
05:27:32.708 --> 05:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
would break their heart
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
having said that there's just no reason
 
05:27:38.448 --> 05:27:38.458 align:start position:0%
for this bill at this time and the
 
05:27:39.948 --> 05:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
Firearms are currently being dealt with
 
05:27:42.410 --> 05:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
however the owners want them to be and
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
if they're not someone's happy to do it
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes representative Muse
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:18.350 --> 05:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
know this bill would only give the
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety an option to
 
05:29:23.570 --> 05:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
correct a surrender and Destroy program
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
and not a mandate and if I know that
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
many other states in the local
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
governments provide this option as a
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
convenience to gun owners and if they
 
05:29:33.170 --> 05:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
know that weapons are already being
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
surrendered to the Department of Safety
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
and providing this option would cost
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers nothing then would I press the
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
red button and defeat this motion thank
 
05:29:42.480 --> 05:29:43.250 align:start position:0%

for a parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:29:49.850 --> 05:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
state police testified that they were
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
not really interested in this bill if I
 
05:29:55.128 --> 05:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
know that no citizen came forward and
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
asked for this bill and if I know that
 
05:29:59.690 --> 05:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
if someone brings their firearm to be
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
destroyed by a licensed firearm dealer
 
05:30:05.448 --> 05:30:05.458 align:start position:0%
they may actually find out that it's
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
worth a lot of money and change their
 
05:30:08.930 --> 05:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
mind which they would never find out if
 
05:30:10.610 --> 05:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
they brought it to the state police and
 
05:30:13.010 --> 05:30:13.020 align:start position:0%

05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker House Bill 201 will make it
 
05:33:25.368 --> 05:33:25.378 align:start position:0%
possible to drive without ever obtaining
 
05:33:28.010 --> 05:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
a driver's license because as we heard
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
and committee people may not know our
 
05:33:31.440 --> 05:33:33.230 align:start position:0%
and committee people may not know our
laws

05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
laws
 
05:33:35.570 --> 05:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
having a valid driver's license is not a
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
New Concept there isn't a single country
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
that does not require some sort of
 
05:33:42.170 --> 05:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
license that you obtain by demonstrating
 
05:33:43.730 --> 05:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
you have the general knowledge and
 
05:33:46.610 --> 05:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
understanding of the rules of the road
 
05:33:49.730 --> 05:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
all by the U.S as a whole doesn't
 
05:33:51.890 --> 05:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
require it but all 50 sovereign states
 
05:33:51.900 --> 05:33:53.690 align:start position:0%
require it but all 50 sovereign states
do

05:33:53.690 --> 05:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:33:56.090 --> 05:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
if passed this law will allow a person
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
to drive without ever acquiring a
 
05:33:59.570 --> 05:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
but wait there's more
 
05:34:03.890 --> 05:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
in the event you were to be caught you
 
05:34:06.410 --> 05:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
would have to be convicted twice in
 
05:34:08.448 --> 05:34:08.458 align:start position:0%
12-month period of time for it to be
 
05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
considered more than a violation
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is a blatant insult to everybody
 
05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
that has made the investment to acquire
 
05:34:17.810 --> 05:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
and maintain a driver's license
 
05:34:21.170 --> 05:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
HP 201 isn't addressing the person that
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
hasn't renewed their license before it
 
05:34:25.550 --> 05:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
expired and has demonstrated that they
 
05:34:27.050 --> 05:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
know and have a basic understanding of
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
driving it is alarming a person that has
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
never obtained a license to justify
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
ignorance and disregard the law because
 
05:34:36.050 --> 05:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
they decided they didn't need to follow
 
05:34:36.060 --> 05:34:37.430 align:start position:0%
they decided they didn't need to follow
it

05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:34:40.070 --> 05:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this is a prime example of
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
someone has an excuse for everything and
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
takes responsibility for nothing

I I move that hb201fn
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
ought to pass in 2015 a change was made
 
05:35:13.128 --> 05:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
to increase the penalty for driving
 
05:35:15.410 --> 05:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
without a license to a misdemeanor after
 
05:35:17.448 --> 05:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
a single tragic accident involving an
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
unlicensed driver who was also driving
 
05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
under the influence of Narcotics and was
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
significantly impaired
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
her major crime was in fact driving
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
under the influence of Narcotics and
 
05:35:31.490 --> 05:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
being significantly impaired however
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
this law was then passed because of that
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
the fire offense has unintended
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
consequences it disproportionately
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
affects some New Hampshire citizens
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
these include single parents people who
 
05:35:45.530 --> 05:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
are economically disadvantaged and
 
05:35:47.330 --> 05:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
people who may be new immigrants or VISA
 
05:35:49.730 --> 05:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
holders who are still learning our laws
 
05:35:51.890 --> 05:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
take for example the case of a family
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
living in a very rural part of the state
 
05:35:55.730 --> 05:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
you cannot afford to have their team
 
05:35:58.128 --> 05:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
take driver's education but needs the
 
05:36:00.410 --> 05:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
team to work part-time or to assist with
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
caring for younger siblings
 
05:36:04.970 --> 05:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
the team may have learned to drive with
 
05:36:06.288 --> 05:36:06.298 align:start position:0%
their family but cannot get a license
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
until they can afford to take driver's
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
education or turn 18. asked in an
 
05:36:12.288 --> 05:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
emergency situation say to get
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
medication for covid
 
05:36:16.128 --> 05:36:16.138 align:start position:0%
to go drive to the pharmacy they're
 
05:36:18.050 --> 05:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
pulled over and cited for unlicensed
 
05:36:18.060 --> 05:36:19.128 align:start position:0%
pulled over and cited for unlicensed
operation

05:36:19.128 --> 05:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
operation
 
05:36:21.170 --> 05:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
this results in a misdemeanor offense on
 
05:36:22.610 --> 05:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
their record which requires they check
 
05:36:24.830 --> 05:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
the box on all job applications in the
 
05:36:27.170 --> 05:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
future indicating the conviction
 
05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
it will influence that team's chances
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
for job prospects for life
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
um also Imagine a single working parent
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
who's been able unable to take unpaid
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
time off from work to get to the DMV on
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the two separate occasions to get their
 
05:36:39.840 --> 05:36:40.970 align:start position:0%
the two separate occasions to get their
license

05:36:40.970 --> 05:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
who gets a Class B misdemeanor
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
necessitating a day in court potential
 
05:36:46.730 --> 05:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
loss of employment or more college
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
student here on a Visa coming from a
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
country where they don't have driver's
 
05:36:50.040 --> 05:36:51.410 align:start position:0%
country where they don't have driver's
licenses

05:36:51.410 --> 05:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
before they hit on the rules they get a
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
car and are stopped on their first drive
 
05:36:57.170 --> 05:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
a Class B misdemeanor can invalidate
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
their visa preventing them from
 
05:37:00.770 --> 05:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
completing their education and causing a
 
05:37:01.970 --> 05:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
loss of tuition payment to the
 
05:37:01.980 --> 05:37:03.650 align:start position:0%
loss of tuition payment to the
university

05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
university
 
05:37:05.930 --> 05:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
in a person who gets upgraded from a
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
moped on their very first and gets their
 
05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
very first Harley-Davidson on their
 
05:37:09.298 --> 05:37:10.490 align:start position:0%
very first Harley-Davidson on their
birthday

05:37:10.490 --> 05:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
birthday
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
they go out for a ride not realize and
 
05:37:13.850 --> 05:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
they actually need a different license
 
05:37:15.890 --> 05:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
than the one they already have
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
some will say these are fair
 
05:37:19.010 --> 05:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
consequences for not knowing our laws
 
05:37:20.930 --> 05:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
and for breaking them and we'll use
 
05:37:22.490 --> 05:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
examples of people driving recklessly
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
without a license or without insurance
 
05:37:26.570 --> 05:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
but they're already specific laws
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
relating to reckless driving that have
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
their own penalties and New Hampshire
 
05:37:31.490 --> 05:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
does not require any person to have
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
insurance regardless of whether or not
 
05:37:34.610 --> 05:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
they have a license
 
05:37:36.410 --> 05:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
people who commit misdemeanors or
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
felonies by driving recklessly or under
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the influence should be charged for
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
those infractions as appropriate
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of driving without a license
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
reverting a first offense back to a
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
citation and let me be clear any
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
additional offenses should definitely
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
have higher consequences as appropriate
 
05:37:55.430 --> 05:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
but first offenses will help reduce the
 
05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
burden on our overloaded court system
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
it'll allow an opportunity to educate
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
people who make inadvertent mistakes or
 
05:38:04.250 --> 05:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
a single poor decision
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it will provide a penalty that
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
actually fits the violation
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
you to vote Yes and pass HP 201 FN to
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a penalty that fits the infraction
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
I do ask for a division vote and I ask
 
05:38:19.128 --> 05:38:19.138 align:start position:0%
you all to push the green button when we
 
05:38:21.530 --> 05:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
do remember you all the questions
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.150 --> 05:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is on a pass on
 
05:38:31.850 --> 05:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 201 a division has been
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the motion to
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
Auto pass in hospital 201 it's the

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:39:30.170 --> 05:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
know that New Hampshire is one of the
 
05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
least restrictive states to operate a
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle and if I know by passing this
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
law would be an insult to every person
 
05:39:38.750 --> 05:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
that has taken the necessary steps to
 
05:39:40.610 --> 05:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
obtain and maintain a driver's license
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%

driver's license online without ever
 
05:39:47.090 --> 05:39:47.100 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill lowers the
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
penalty for an unlicensed driver for the
 
05:40:05.690 --> 05:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
first offense of driving without a
 
05:40:08.448 --> 05:40:08.458 align:start position:0%

violation
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
and if I know that getting a license and
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
insurance can be a financial issue for
 
05:40:17.448 --> 05:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
young people in rural areas and an

05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
conviction for Class B misdemeanor which
 
05:40:31.010 --> 05:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
is the current penalty for driving
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
without ever having a license and that
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
some people in our state are caught
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
between a rock and a hard place when it
 
05:40:40.850 --> 05:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
comes to the need to drive to get or
 
05:40:43.010 --> 05:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
keep employment and the need to feed
 
05:40:46.128 --> 05:40:46.138 align:start position:0%
their families and finally if I know
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
that nothing in this bill changes the
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
fact that first offenders will still be
 
05:40:53.570 --> 05:40:53.580 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker today we have the opportunity
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
to make an historic decision in the
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
fight against the failed War on Drugs
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
the bill before us proposes the complete
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
deletion of the controlled Drug Act in
 
05:43:11.930 --> 05:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire putting an
 
05:43:14.570 --> 05:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
end to this outdated harmful policy once
 
05:43:15.770 --> 05:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
and for all
 
05:43:17.868 --> 05:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
the bill represents the end of the war
 
05:43:19.550 --> 05:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
on drugs in New Hampshire and we have a
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
chance to make a real difference in the
 
05:43:22.730 --> 05:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
lives of our citizens the controlled
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
Drug Act has been in place for decades
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
and what has it achieved we've seen
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
increased rates of incarceration
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
addiction and drug-related violence it's
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
time to acknowledge that this policy has
 
05:43:34.430 --> 05:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
failed and move on to a more effective
 
05:43:34.440 --> 05:43:35.690 align:start position:0%
failed and move on to a more effective
approach

05:43:35.690 --> 05:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
approach
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
as we consider this bill it's important
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
to remember the lessons of History the
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
parallels between alcohol prohibition
 
05:43:44.208 --> 05:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
and the war on drugs are striking both
 
05:43:45.770 --> 05:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
policies were created with the best of
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
intentions but ultimately proved to be
 
05:43:49.850 --> 05:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
ineffective and cause more harm than
 
05:43:49.860 --> 05:43:50.810 align:start position:0%
ineffective and cause more harm than
good

05:43:50.810 --> 05:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:43:53.208 --> 05:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
during prohibition the government banned
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
production importation transportation
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
and sale of alcohol in the United States
 
05:43:59.090 --> 05:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
this resulted in an increase in
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
organized crime black market sales and
 
05:44:03.650 --> 05:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
the spread of dangerous substances all
 
05:44:05.448 --> 05:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
while failing to reduce the consumption
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
of alcohol
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
similarly the War on Drugs have been
 
05:44:10.810 --> 05:44:10.820 align:start position:0%
characterized by aggressive enforcement
 
05:44:13.368 --> 05:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentences and a focus
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
on punishment over treatment
 
05:44:17.628 --> 05:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
this has led to a massive increase in
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates particularly for
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-violent drug offenses and has done
 
05:44:23.208 --> 05:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
little to stem the tide of drug
 
05:44:24.770 --> 05:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
addiction and abuse
 
05:44:27.110 --> 05:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
instead create a black market for drugs
 
05:44:29.090 --> 05:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
contribute to the spread of disease and
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
left countless families devastated by
 
05:44:32.570 --> 05:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
the consequences of this misguided
 
05:44:32.580 --> 05:44:34.850 align:start position:0%
the consequences of this misguided
policy

05:44:34.850 --> 05:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:44:36.890 --> 05:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
prohibition was a failed policy that
 
05:44:38.330 --> 05:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
only increased violence and Corruption
 
05:44:40.850 --> 05:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
and the same can be said about the War
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
on Drugs we have seen the devastation it
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
has caused
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
it may be argued that this decision is
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
too simple and the problem is more
 
05:44:50.810 --> 05:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
nuanced than just ending the War on
 
05:44:54.530 --> 05:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
Drugs uh but this bill will allow us to
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
redirect our resources towards more
 
05:44:59.090 --> 05:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
effective drug policy such as prevention
 
05:45:00.770 --> 05:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
education and treatment
 
05:45:03.610 --> 05:45:03.620 align:start position:0%
uh moreover the public wants this change
 
05:45:06.048 --> 05:45:06.058 align:start position:0%
polls show that 83 percent of Americans
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to end the war on drugs and so it's
 
05:45:09.890 --> 05:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
time to listen to our constituents and
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
make this a reality
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
and we have the power to make a
 
05:45:15.048 --> 05:45:15.058 align:start position:0%
difference in the lives of our citizens
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I urge all my fellow
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislative support this bill we have
 
05:45:21.470 --> 05:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
had the chance we have the chance to
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
make history to end the War on Drugs in
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh so let's not over complicate it with
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
endless hearings and meetings and take
 
05:45:30.230 --> 05:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
action now to make a real difference
 
05:45:32.930 --> 05:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker as a member yield

05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question to
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
be really short here would you agree
 
05:45:48.288 --> 05:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
that the main accomplishment of the War
 
05:45:50.570 --> 05:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
on Drugs over the last 50 years is that
 
05:45:52.128 --> 05:45:52.138 align:start position:0%
we now have drugs that are more
 
05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
available more deadly and less expensive
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
than they were when we started this
 
05:46:02.570 --> 05:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
yes I agree and I would add that the War
 
05:46:05.750 --> 05:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
on Drugs has actually increased the
 
05:46:08.810 --> 05:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
potency of uh of drugs than they
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.110 --> 05:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to speak
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
against the committee report the War on
 
05:46:26.090 --> 05:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
Drugs has failed the controlled Drug Act
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
has failed it has not stopped people
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
from using or abusing drugs it doesn't
 
05:46:34.010 --> 05:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
keep drugs out of the hands of our
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
children or stop people from overdosing
 
05:46:39.410 --> 05:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
it does criminalize working-class people
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
without the means to litigate this in
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
court it does leave people mistrusting
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement and other
 
05:46:46.080 --> 05:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement and other
institutions

05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard these arguments against drug
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
laws and the drug war ad nauseam so I'd
 
05:46:55.128 --> 05:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
like to just end with a quote from a man
 
05:46:58.610 --> 05:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
who helped pass the controlled Drug Act
 
05:47:01.730 --> 05:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know what this War on Drugs was
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
really about
 
05:47:05.868 --> 05:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
the Nixon campaign in 1968 and the Nixon
 
05:47:07.850 --> 05:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
white house after that had two enemies
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
the anti-war left and black people
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
you understand what I'm saying
 
05:47:15.170 --> 05:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
we knew what we knew we couldn't make it
 
05:47:17.448 --> 05:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
illegal to be either against the war or
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
black but by getting the public to
 
05:47:22.490 --> 05:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
associate hippies with marijuana and
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
blacks with heroin and then
 
05:47:26.570 --> 05:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
criminalizing both heavily we could
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
disrupt those communities raid their
 
05:47:31.128 --> 05:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
homes break up their meetings and vilify
 
05:47:33.170 --> 05:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
them night after night on the evening
 
05:47:35.628 --> 05:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
news did we know we were lying about the
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
drugs of course we did so I think given
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
the intent of this law given that it was
 
05:47:45.650 --> 05:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
so flawly it was passed with so many
 
05:47:48.830 --> 05:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
flaws that it would be the least we can
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
do as a body to repeal Allah with such
 
05:47:53.448 --> 05:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
intent thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I'm not
 
05:48:01.610 --> 05:48:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to defend the War on Drugs I don't
 
05:48:03.770 --> 05:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
even really know what that means it's so
 
05:48:06.048 --> 05:48:06.058 align:start position:0%
complicated now but I just want to make
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
clear what what the representatives are
 
05:48:10.128 --> 05:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
proposing they're proposing that we
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
today vote to legalize heroin legalize
 
05:48:15.530 --> 05:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
cocaine legalize methamphetamines
 
05:48:15.540 --> 05:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
cocaine legalize methamphetamines
legalize

05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
legalize
 
05:48:20.690 --> 05:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else LSD PCP you name
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
it they want to legalize it today and
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
they want you to vote for it because
 
05:48:26.448 --> 05:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
they see your constituents want that
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
I checked my messages I didn't get any
 
05:48:30.048 --> 05:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
messages you might get stitched through
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
and say could you please go to Concord
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
and make all drugs legal
 
05:48:35.810 --> 05:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
finally I would say that while we've
 
05:48:37.368 --> 05:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
been sitting here there's a darn good
 
05:48:38.810 --> 05:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
chance that someone's died of an
 
05:48:41.390 --> 05:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
overdose of fentanyl while we've been
 
05:48:43.010 --> 05:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
sitting here in our warm room debating
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
this so I think that maybe if we we are
 
05:48:47.330 --> 05:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
going to do this it's going to be
 
05:48:48.770 --> 05:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
thoughtful it's going to be slow it's
 
05:48:50.270 --> 05:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to be measured and it's got to be
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.590 --> 05:48:57.600 align:start position:0%

uh thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
this bill is for direct certification
 
06:00:44.810 --> 06:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid it's really a resolution or
 
06:00:47.208 --> 06:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
directive not real legislation as we
 
06:00:49.610 --> 06:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
would think of it it directs the
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
and education to seek participation of
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal pilot program to use Medicaid
 
06:01:00.530 --> 06:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
enrollment family information and
 
06:01:03.530 --> 06:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
confidential doe information on students
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
to register students in the free and
 
06:01:07.330 --> 06:01:07.340 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch program
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
puts nothing in statute and that's part
 
06:01:11.570 --> 06:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
06:01:14.330 --> 06:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
you will hear about the benefits of this
 
06:01:17.390 --> 06:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
program and that it will automatically
 
06:01:20.448 --> 06:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
register uh families it will probably
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
increase the number of students eligible
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunches and
 
06:01:27.410 --> 06:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
probably more differentiated Aid to
 
06:01:30.410 --> 06:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
school districts it's all probably true
 
06:01:33.770 --> 06:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
there are already similar programs in
 
06:01:36.350 --> 06:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
place for snap and TANF food stamps and
 
06:01:38.330 --> 06:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
welfare recipients for direct
 
06:01:38.340 --> 06:01:40.250 align:start position:0%
welfare recipients for direct
certification

06:01:40.250 --> 06:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
certification
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
neither of these programs is in statute
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
or in rules it evidently is just
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
agreements signed by departments with
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
that requires matching This Confidential
 
06:01:57.890 --> 06:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
student information to register the
 
06:01:57.900 --> 06:01:59.270 align:start position:0%
student information to register the
students

06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:02:02.930 --> 06:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
we are told that these processes have I
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
opt out ability for parents
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we're told the Medicaid will also
 
06:02:14.208 --> 06:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
but opting out it's too easy to skip
 
06:02:17.448 --> 06:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
over an opt-out question on an exam on a
 
06:02:17.458 --> 06:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
over an opt-out question on an exam on a
registration

06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
registration
 
06:02:22.730 --> 06:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
but we also had testimony that in the
 
06:02:26.030 --> 06:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
stat snap and TANF opt-outs a couple of
 
06:02:27.770 --> 06:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
those opt-outs were terminated someone
 
06:02:32.330 --> 06:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
just decided to get rid of them and so
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're gone and so they're not in place
 
06:02:34.200 --> 06:02:35.930 align:start position:0%
they're gone and so they're not in place
anymore

06:02:35.930 --> 06:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:02:37.368 --> 06:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
who knew
 
06:02:39.288 --> 06:02:39.298 align:start position:0%
someone in an apartment made that
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
decision there was no legislative or
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
oversight to that decision
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment will do three things
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
it will put the Medicaid direct
 
06:02:54.470 --> 06:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
certification program in statute
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
it will require parental opt-in
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
rather than opt out
 
06:03:02.770 --> 06:03:02.780 align:start position:0%
and thirdly it will require
 
06:03:06.650 --> 06:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
DHHS and doe Commissioners to certify
 
06:03:09.170 --> 06:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
that the programs comply with all
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws
 
06:03:14.090 --> 06:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
if we are going down this path there has
 
06:03:16.490 --> 06:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
to be legislative oversight
 
06:03:19.610 --> 06:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
this will put it into doe statutes right
 
06:03:22.730 --> 06:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
in the Privacy section
 
06:03:26.030 --> 06:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
parents opt in for so many programs we
 
06:03:28.490 --> 06:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
just passed legislation about adopting
 
06:03:31.610 --> 06:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
in for WIC program we opt in to run for
 
06:03:33.890 --> 06:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
office parents should have that same
 
06:03:36.410 --> 06:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
ability when when they enter into this
 
06:03:39.650 --> 06:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
program in addition this amendment
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
specifies that when they opt in it will
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
list the confidential student
 
06:03:49.368 --> 06:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
information that's being matched what
 
06:03:51.048 --> 06:03:51.058 align:start position:0%
information from their student will be
 
06:03:54.048 --> 06:03:54.058 align:start position:0%
used and that is the name date of birth
 
06:03:57.170 --> 06:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
address and sex confidential information
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
from the state doe web excuse me
 
06:04:00.120 --> 06:04:02.930 align:start position:0%
from the state doe web excuse me
database

06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
database
 
06:04:05.690 --> 06:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
so this program this amendment makes
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
this an opt-in program we think that's
 
06:04:09.650 --> 06:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
very important
 
06:04:11.750 --> 06:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
finally does the process comply with
 
06:04:14.270 --> 06:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state law we have very
 
06:04:14.280 --> 06:04:15.548 align:start position:0%
federal and state law we have very
strict

06:04:15.548 --> 06:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
strict
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
privacy laws about confidential student
 
06:04:18.360 --> 06:04:19.788 align:start position:0%
privacy laws about confidential student
information

06:04:19.788 --> 06:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:04:23.090 --> 06:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
in fact there was a federal program a
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal law related to data matching
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
does this program comply with those
 
06:04:29.520 --> 06:04:31.250 align:start position:0%
does this program comply with those
laws

06:04:31.250 --> 06:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
laws
 
06:04:34.010 --> 06:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
this amendment requires a certification
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
by the Commissioners that it does
 
06:04:39.770 --> 06:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
if you vote against this amendment
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%

06:05:31.250 --> 06:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
you stated that the original bill was a
 
06:05:33.530 --> 06:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
directive rather than legislation can
 
06:05:37.970 --> 06:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.850 --> 06:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
um yes the basic bill as is in front of
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
us does not put anything in statute it's
 
06:05:49.970 --> 06:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
basically two sentences
 
06:05:52.128 --> 06:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to seek
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
participation in the demonstration
 
06:05:56.208 --> 06:05:56.218 align:start position:0%

Department of Education as needed in
 
06:06:08.208 --> 06:06:08.218 align:start position:0%
pursuing and implementing this new
 
06:06:10.250 --> 06:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
direct certification
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's it there's nothing about opt-in
 
06:06:15.230 --> 06:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about privacy nothing
 
06:06:18.650 --> 06:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's a cart launch for our departments
 
06:06:22.250 --> 06:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%

Speaker and um and this is exactly what
 
06:06:32.810 --> 06:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
the governor has asked us to do
 
06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the proposed floor amendment was
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
never considered by the committee it
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
would essentially nullify every
 
06:06:41.208 --> 06:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
Advantage stemming from the state's
 
06:06:43.490 --> 06:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
participation in the Medicaid direct
 
06:06:46.610 --> 06:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
certification pilot program these
 
06:06:48.770 --> 06:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
advantages include an easy application
 
06:06:52.010 --> 06:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
free process for students excuse me to
 
06:06:54.170 --> 06:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
receive free and reduced price meals at
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
schools reduce time spent by Cool School
 
06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
administrators chasing down paperwork
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and more accurate data used to determine
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
school funding since 2012 39 other
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
states have joined the Medicaid direct
 
06:07:11.810 --> 06:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
certification program which has resulted
 
06:07:13.970 --> 06:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
in a 12 percent increase in the number
 
06:07:16.128 --> 06:07:16.138 align:start position:0%
of students that now can receive a free
 
06:07:19.788 --> 06:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
and reduced price meal at school in in
 
06:07:21.410 --> 06:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
the state of Texas it's actually
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
increased School Meal participation by
 
06:07:26.448 --> 06:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
48 percent
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
proponents of the amendment say that it
 
06:07:31.250 --> 06:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
protects privacy but nothing could be
 
06:07:33.170 --> 06:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
further than the truth
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 601 as introduced without any
 
06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendments is what we need it's what the
 
06:07:41.208 --> 06:07:41.218 align:start position:0%

06:07:46.070 --> 06:07:46.080 align:start position:0%

children and has more to do with
 
06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%

06:14:37.670 --> 06:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
I have read the application on this bill
 
06:14:40.368 --> 06:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
this bill does not say
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
we have an option it doesn't even say
 
06:14:43.680 --> 06:14:46.128 align:start position:0%
we have an option it doesn't even say
that

06:14:46.128 --> 06:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:46.138 --> 06:14:47.810 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:14:47.810 --> 06:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:50.208 --> 06:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just passed will
 
06:14:54.048 --> 06:14:54.058 align:start position:0%
have any effect but it does say is that
 
06:14:57.410 --> 06:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
if we apply just apply
 
06:15:00.430 --> 06:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
we are making a contractual agreement
 
06:15:03.590 --> 06:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the federal government to follow
 
06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
through with this program and it also
 
06:15:09.650 --> 06:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
says they can add whatever rules they
 
06:15:09.660 --> 06:15:11.330 align:start position:0%
says they can add whatever rules they
want

06:15:11.330 --> 06:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
want
 
06:15:14.750 --> 06:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
do you guys remember the 55 mile an hour
 
06:15:16.430 --> 06:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
speed limit
 
06:15:20.930 --> 06:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
do you guys remember how we collect our
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
Federal gas taxes and how they
 
06:15:26.330 --> 06:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
supposedly give them back so we can take
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
care of our roads and yet
 
06:15:32.448 --> 06:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
if we didn't put 55 miles we weren't
 
06:15:36.530 --> 06:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
getting our money back to to take care
 
06:15:38.208 --> 06:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
of our roads
 
06:15:40.970 --> 06:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
and so the idea that we can say parents
 
06:15:42.350 --> 06:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
opt in
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it I believe it's
 
06:15:46.250 --> 06:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal government says
 
06:15:47.868 --> 06:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to do and we better jump to
 
06:15:51.170 --> 06:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
it or we're going to lose all of our
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
free or reduced lunch money and we won't
 
06:15:56.448 --> 06:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
be able to support any children to get
 
06:15:58.610 --> 06:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
free or reduced lunch
 
06:16:02.208 --> 06:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
the other thing there
 
06:16:04.310 --> 06:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint is that we're not getting
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
these this paperwork back well their
 
06:16:11.208 --> 06:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
parents who are absolutely adamant
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
against filling out this paperwork
 
06:16:15.708 --> 06:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
because they don't want the schools to
 
06:16:17.810 --> 06:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
know that they're on Medicaid
 
06:16:19.730 --> 06:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
they're embarrassed at having to be on
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and they don't want anybody to
 
06:16:24.530 --> 06:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
know well guess what if we pass this
 
06:16:24.540 --> 06:16:25.548 align:start position:0%
know well guess what if we pass this
bill

06:16:25.548 --> 06:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:16:28.670 --> 06:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
every kid on free and reduced lunch is
 
06:16:31.850 --> 06:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
going to be Medicaid and it's and a list
 
06:16:33.410 --> 06:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
of those kids would be sent to the
 
06:16:36.048 --> 06:16:36.058 align:start position:0%
school so we're going behind the parents
 
06:16:40.850 --> 06:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
back in their desire for privacy
 
06:16:43.730 --> 06:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
and giving the schools a list of the
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
yet we have we
 
06:16:49.680 --> 06:16:51.470 align:start position:0%
yet we have we
we instituted

06:16:51.470 --> 06:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
we instituted
 
06:16:53.470 --> 06:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
a um
 
06:16:55.850 --> 06:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment valuing
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
people's privacy and yet we're going to
 
06:17:02.390 --> 06:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
vote to go around parents backs
 
06:17:04.548 --> 06:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
and then well
 
06:17:07.730 --> 06:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
the forms fall off when you get to
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
particularly Juniors and seniors in high
 
06:17:09.840 --> 06:17:10.548 align:start position:0%
particularly Juniors and seniors in high
school

06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:17:12.530 --> 06:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
even when their parents fill them out
 
06:17:16.368 --> 06:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
the students don't turn them in hmm I
 
06:17:18.770 --> 06:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
wonder why seems that that's about the
 
06:17:21.350 --> 06:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
time kids can start working on their own
 
06:17:24.770 --> 06:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of those kids either don't want
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
anybody else to know that they're free
 
06:17:29.868 --> 06:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch or they absolutely
 
06:17:31.970 --> 06:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
hate the meals
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
I mean a lot of them say they're
 
06:17:33.718 --> 06:17:35.090 align:start position:0%
I mean a lot of them say they're
disgusting

06:17:35.090 --> 06:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
disgusting
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they finally are able to get a
 
06:17:40.010 --> 06:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
little of their own money and do a la
 
06:17:41.830 --> 06:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
carte meals which they like a lot better
 
06:17:45.048 --> 06:17:45.058 align:start position:0%
so why don't we stop going around the
 
06:17:49.030 --> 06:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
backs of parents and students and
 
06:17:51.890 --> 06:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
just if they want the meals they can
 
06:17:53.570 --> 06:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
fill out the paperwork if they don't
 
06:17:56.208 --> 06:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
they don't peel out the paperwork a lot
 
06:17:58.190 --> 06:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
of this is actually about trying to get
 
06:18:00.470 --> 06:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
greater numbers for free and reduced
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
lunch for figuring out how to give extra
 
06:18:05.570 --> 06:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
money to schools there are other ways of
 
06:18:08.448 --> 06:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
doing that we don't need to go behind
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
parents backs to do it so please vote
 
06:18:16.548 --> 06:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
against passing this thank you very much
 
06:18:22.128 --> 06:18:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:25.128 --> 06:18:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues uh
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
you've just heard some very good reasons
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
why we shouldn't pass this bill I'll
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
just expand on that very briefly
 
06:18:33.530 --> 06:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
um first of all as you've heard this is
 
06:18:36.048 --> 06:18:36.058 align:start position:0%
a brand new federal program and federal
 
06:18:39.230 --> 06:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
programs come with Federal mandates now
 
06:18:41.448 --> 06:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
you may or may not know this
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
but Federal mandates as they currently
 
06:18:45.788 --> 06:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
exist in education law are currently
 
06:18:49.610 --> 06:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
overriding New Hampshire state law
 
06:18:52.670 --> 06:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot do the things we want to from
 
06:18:56.330 --> 06:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
curriculum to nutrition because they are
 
06:18:58.850 --> 06:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
federally mandated that we adopt certain
 
06:19:01.730 --> 06:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
guidelines in order to receive money
 
06:19:03.708 --> 06:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
because of these Federal programs that
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
we keep getting into
 
06:19:08.448 --> 06:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
I need people to understand that
 
06:19:11.208 --> 06:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
anything we try to do to fix education
 
06:19:13.250 --> 06:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the granite state
 
06:19:15.170 --> 06:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
until we get the federal government out
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
is merely a Band-Aid on a bullet wound
 
06:19:23.750 --> 06:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:26.690 --> 06:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
with that I would ask you to vote
 
06:19:30.948 --> 06:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
against the o2p OTP motion thank you
 
06:19:39.288 --> 06:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:19:44.868 --> 06:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of House Bill
 
06:19:44.878 --> 06:19:46.250 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of House Bill
601

06:19:46.250 --> 06:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
601
 
06:19:49.010 --> 06:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill
 
06:19:51.948 --> 06:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's simply allows
 
06:19:53.690 --> 06:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
the division of Health and Human
 
06:19:53.700 --> 06:19:55.070 align:start position:0%
the division of Health and Human
Services

06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
Services
 
06:19:57.650 --> 06:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education to share
 
06:19:57.660 --> 06:19:59.628 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education to share
data

06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:20:01.910 --> 06:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
it will eliminate the need for school
 
06:20:04.010 --> 06:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
districts you have to go through the
 
06:20:06.350 --> 06:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
whole process of filling out forms for
 
06:20:09.230 --> 06:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
it will give us better more accurate
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
numbers when we are filling when we are
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
compiling the adequacy information so
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
that we'll have more accurate numbers
 
06:20:24.110 --> 06:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch students
 
06:20:26.448 --> 06:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
going into the formula
 
06:20:28.490 --> 06:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:20:30.650 --> 06:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
is simple
 
06:20:32.930 --> 06:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
it just directs the Department of
 
06:20:35.090 --> 06:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
Education to work with Health and Human
 
06:20:35.100 --> 06:20:37.910 align:start position:0%
Education to work with Health and Human
Services

06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:41.170 --> 06:20:41.180 align:start position:0%
the information is already in existence
 
06:20:45.048 --> 06:20:45.058 align:start position:0%
it just allows them to connect it all
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
information is kept completely
 
06:20:47.100 --> 06:20:49.368 align:start position:0%
information is kept completely
confidential

06:20:49.368 --> 06:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
06:20:52.970 --> 06:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
it also allows for more students we know
 
06:20:55.250 --> 06:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
that a lot of families don't fill out
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
those forms and a lot of children don't
 
06:21:01.368 --> 06:21:01.378 align:start position:0%
get access to bring reduced lunch meals
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
as they should and this would make that
 
06:21:04.080 --> 06:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
as they should and this would make that
difference

06:21:05.090 --> 06:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
difference
 
06:21:07.448 --> 06:21:07.458 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill it's a simple Bill
 
06:21:11.270 --> 06:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
we heard Governor sununu talk about its
 
06:21:13.730 --> 06:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
importance to make this happen
 
06:21:17.150 --> 06:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
we know that more hungry kids in schools
 
06:21:20.150 --> 06:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
are kids that don't learn as well we
 
06:21:23.208 --> 06:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
need this to happen it's a simple it's
 
06:21:25.128 --> 06:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
not even going to happen right away it
 
06:21:27.430 --> 06:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be enacted until
 
06:21:31.010 --> 06:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
2026. so I ask for your support we have
 
06:21:33.410 --> 06:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
talked about this bill time and time and
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
time again it's not nefarious in any
 
06:21:40.368 --> 06:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
ways it's just a plain simple build that
 
06:21:43.490 --> 06:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
connects two sets of existing data in
 
06:21:45.948 --> 06:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
order to help children so I thank you
 
06:21:47.868 --> 06:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
for your support and I hope you will
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
press the green button and vote Yes on
 
06:22:04.910 --> 06:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:07.250 --> 06:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
the motion before us has ought to pass
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:19.368 --> 06:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
a division has been called
 
06:22:22.490 --> 06:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
expected somebody to uh so this will be
 
06:22:23.930 --> 06:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
a division of vote members take your
 
06:22:23.940 --> 06:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
a division of vote members take your
seats

06:22:27.350 --> 06:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:27.360 --> 06:23:27.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:23:27.610 --> 06:23:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.610 --> 06:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
601 this is a division vote
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I recognize as representative Ladd
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.850 --> 06:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
if I know that a number of high school
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
students in grades 10 11 and 12 these
 
06:23:55.250 --> 06:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
students that are eligible for the
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
program are no longer participating due
 
06:24:01.368 --> 06:24:01.378 align:start position:0%
to a number of issues within the schools
 
06:24:03.650 --> 06:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
much different than the
 
06:24:06.350 --> 06:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
number of kids to participate in the
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
Middle School grades if I know 39 states
 
06:24:12.288 --> 06:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
are participating in the Medicaid direct
 
06:24:15.708 --> 06:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
program without issues associated with
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
mishandling of student privacy and
 
06:24:21.650 --> 06:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
family confidential information and most
 
06:24:24.230 --> 06:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
importantly these high school students
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
in those states are having meals
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
at lunch
 
06:24:34.970 --> 06:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
and if I know HHS has stated that
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
medical or Medicaid information will not
 
06:24:42.288 --> 06:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
be shared with de doe without parent
 
06:24:42.298 --> 06:24:43.788 align:start position:0%
be shared with de doe without parent
permission

06:24:43.788 --> 06:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
permission
 
06:24:45.830 --> 06:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
if I also know that Medicaid direct
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
program in this bill very is very
 
06:24:53.810 --> 06:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
similar to the same process in which
 
06:24:55.970 --> 06:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
school districts currently determine
 
06:24:59.208 --> 06:24:59.218 align:start position:0%
meal program eligibility using snap and
 
06:24:59.218 --> 06:25:00.770 align:start position:0%
meal program eligibility using snap and
TANF

06:25:00.770 --> 06:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
TANF
 
06:25:03.410 --> 06:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
would I therefore support the 13-7
 
06:25:05.150 --> 06:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee report

06:34:48.470 --> 06:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise today to
 
06:34:50.810 --> 06:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
speak in support of floor Amendment 453h
 
06:34:52.368 --> 06:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
which would add a clause accepting
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
agritourism from this bill I come from a
 
06:34:56.868 --> 06:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
town with a proud agricultural Heritage
 
06:34:58.850 --> 06:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
in fact the largest farm in our town is
 
06:35:00.170 --> 06:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
owned by the former Speaker of the House
 
06:35:02.448 --> 06:35:02.458 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Doug scammon when we look
 
06:35:03.948 --> 06:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
at this bill we think of those Farms
 
06:35:05.868 --> 06:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
large and small that might need to work
 
06:35:08.090 --> 06:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
at all hours of the day from pulling a
 
06:35:10.070 --> 06:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
stuck cow out of pasture to unloading a
 
06:35:11.570 --> 06:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
truck in the early hours
 
06:35:13.490 --> 06:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
however the definition of farming and
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
state law is extremely expansive and can
 
06:35:17.330 --> 06:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
include a homeowner with one or two
 
06:35:19.190 --> 06:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
chickens or the eight raised beds I have
 
06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
in my backyard
 
06:35:22.430 --> 06:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation would exempt any person
 
06:35:24.288 --> 06:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
involved in agriculture at any size or
 
06:35:26.570 --> 06:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
level from local Norse ordinances the
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
definition of farming and state law also
 
06:35:29.690 --> 06:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
includes marketing which in turn
 
06:35:32.030 --> 06:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
includes agri-tourism this amendment
 
06:35:33.410 --> 06:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
would create some guard rails to the
 
06:35:34.788 --> 06:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
bill by adding an exception for
 
06:35:34.798 --> 06:35:36.350 align:start position:0%
bill by adding an exception for
agri-tourism

06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
agri-tourism
 
06:35:38.390 --> 06:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment was in fact suggested and
 
06:35:39.590 --> 06:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
supported by the Commissioner of
 
06:35:41.628 --> 06:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
Agriculture who otherwise supported the
 
06:35:43.490 --> 06:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner Jasper expressed
 
06:35:45.890 --> 06:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
concerned that including agritourism in
 
06:35:48.110 --> 06:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
the exemption could in fact exacerbate
 
06:35:50.330 --> 06:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
exasperate disagreements between farms
 
06:35:52.850 --> 06:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
and town residents the commissioner also
 
06:35:54.530 --> 06:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
believes decisions about noise ordinance
 
06:35:56.270 --> 06:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
relative to agritourism businesses
 
06:35:58.510 --> 06:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
should remain under local control
 
06:36:00.470 --> 06:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
agritosa may include everything from
 
06:36:02.208 --> 06:36:02.218 align:start position:0%
corn mazes to farm camps to pick your
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
own spots to Vineyards it can represent
 
06:36:05.690 --> 06:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
a way for Farms to become more viable
 
06:36:07.670 --> 06:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
and is supported in numerous ways in
 
06:36:09.770 --> 06:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
state law it is important to note that
 
06:36:11.150 --> 06:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not preclude a
 
06:36:12.650 --> 06:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
municipality from exempting and
 
06:36:14.030 --> 06:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
agritourism business from noise
 
06:36:16.368 --> 06:36:16.378 align:start position:0%
ordinances it just allows our towns and
 
06:36:18.590 --> 06:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
cities to continue to make decisions at
 
06:36:20.390 --> 06:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
a local level instead of into one size
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
fits-all model for the entire State as a
 
06:36:24.830 --> 06:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative said earlier today one
 
06:36:27.288 --> 06:36:27.298 align:start position:0%
size fits all rarely fits anyone
 
06:36:28.730 --> 06:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
a member of the environment and
 
06:36:29.868 --> 06:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee asks why
 
06:36:31.610 --> 06:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
agrotourism businesses shouldn't just be
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to do their business they should
 
06:36:35.570 --> 06:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment just recognizes that
 
06:36:37.010 --> 06:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
agricultural properties are often
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
adjacent to residentially zoned areas
 
06:36:40.730 --> 06:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
and that town should have the ability to
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
consider applying noise ordinances to a
 
06:36:44.930 --> 06:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
wedding venue at a farm property in the
 
06:36:46.610 --> 06:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
same way they would to a restaurant's
 
06:36:47.930 --> 06:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
event space
 
06:36:49.610 --> 06:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
to continue to show support for our
 
06:36:51.530 --> 06:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
state's Farmers while also ensuring a
 
06:36:53.208 --> 06:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
positive relationship for agritourism
 
06:36:55.010 --> 06:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
businesses within their towns and cities
 
06:36:57.470 --> 06:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
Guided by local control I urge you to
 
06:36:59.570 --> 06:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on this amendment and
 
06:37:01.670 --> 06:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
I do request a division vote thank you
 
06:37:03.048 --> 06:37:03.058 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
06:37:15.650 --> 06:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:18.470 --> 06:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
I oppose this amendment
 
06:37:21.170 --> 06:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows agricultural
 
06:37:23.150 --> 06:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
activities to be exempt from noise
 
06:37:27.170 --> 06:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
ordinances except for agritourism
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
the real complaint was what if they host
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
weddings on the farm
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
but agritourism is so much more than
 
06:37:35.150 --> 06:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
just weddings
 
06:37:38.810 --> 06:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
it is education it is fundraises it's
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
Farm to Table dinners it's full moon
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
walks it's bonfires and so and more and
 
06:37:47.570 --> 06:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
more and more how many weddings can one
 
06:37:51.650 --> 06:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
Farm hold outdoors in our climate
 
06:37:53.810 --> 06:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
if we think that officials can be
 
06:37:53.820 --> 06:37:54.948 align:start position:0%
if we think that officials can be
reasonable

06:37:54.948 --> 06:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
06:37:57.410 --> 06:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
let us ask the woman who is harassed
 
06:38:00.110 --> 06:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
because her rooster crowed outside the
 
06:38:02.930 --> 06:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance ours
 
06:38:06.410 --> 06:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
or maybe take a page out of the Town who
 
06:38:06.420 --> 06:38:07.250 align:start position:0%
or maybe take a page out of the Town who
went

06:38:07.250 --> 06:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
went
 
06:38:09.530 --> 06:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
to someone and asked if they could turn
 
06:38:13.010 --> 06:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
down the music after a certain hour
 
06:38:16.610 --> 06:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
do you want houses or do you want Farms
 
06:38:19.250 --> 06:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
help the farmers keep their land and
 
06:38:24.350 --> 06:38:24.360 align:start position:0%

their ability to operate as Farms but if
 
06:41:40.910 --> 06:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
I also believe that agritourism is not

always related to farming would I now

06:44:29.868 --> 06:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I Rise this
 
06:44:31.610 --> 06:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
afternoon to speak or this evening at
 
06:44:33.590 --> 06:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
this point uh to speak in opposition to
 
06:44:36.350 --> 06:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 252 for three reasons uh
 
06:44:38.448 --> 06:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
first of all as my honorable colleague
 
06:44:40.310 --> 06:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative NAB pointed out earlier
 
06:44:42.948 --> 06:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
our definition of agriculture are an
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
agricultural operation is very broad
 
06:44:48.470 --> 06:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily just Farm
 
06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
operations that we might have in mind it
 
06:44:53.810 --> 06:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
might also apply to activities that are
 
06:44:56.030 --> 06:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
being carried out in more residential
 
06:44:59.810 --> 06:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
kind of of neighborhoods uh and that
 
06:45:02.288 --> 06:45:02.298 align:start position:0%
leads me to my second point is different
 
06:45:04.970 --> 06:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
localities in our state have different
 
06:45:06.410 --> 06:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
demographics and they have different
 
06:45:08.570 --> 06:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
geographies and they should be allowed
 
06:45:11.090 --> 06:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions based upon what
 
06:45:13.368 --> 06:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
is right for them
 
06:45:15.470 --> 06:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
06:45:18.288 --> 06:45:18.298 align:start position:0%
if we pass this as a state law
 
06:45:21.230 --> 06:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
and a municipality or two come back to
 
06:45:23.448 --> 06:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
us in the next year the year after that
 
06:45:25.670 --> 06:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
we'll say to them we're not going to
 
06:45:27.708 --> 06:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
change state law just because one town
 
06:45:29.868 --> 06:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
or one municipality
 
06:45:31.548 --> 06:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't think that this is working for
 
06:45:34.368 --> 06:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
them if a municipality passes noise
 
06:45:36.110 --> 06:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance at the local level and it
 
06:45:38.090 --> 06:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't work out very well next year
 
06:45:40.128 --> 06:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
they can go back and change it or they
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
can tweak it they can do what is right
 
06:45:43.490 --> 06:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
for them
 
06:45:45.410 --> 06:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker
 
06:45:47.990 --> 06:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
many of my honorable friends in the
 
06:45:50.810 --> 06:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
house use a couple of phrases
 
06:45:54.350 --> 06:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
that confuse me at times one is local
 
06:45:56.628 --> 06:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
government and the other is that we
 
06:45:56.638 --> 06:45:57.650 align:start position:0%
government and the other is that we
shouldn't

06:45:57.650 --> 06:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
06:45:59.948 --> 06:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
try to come up with solution one size
 
06:46:02.990 --> 06:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
fits all solutions I'm confused about
 
06:46:05.208 --> 06:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
what we mean by local government because
 
06:46:07.310 --> 06:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes from what some of my honorable
 
06:46:07.320 --> 06:46:08.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes from what some of my honorable
friends

06:46:08.510 --> 06:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
friends
 
06:46:11.570 --> 06:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
argue in this well that seems to mean
 
06:46:13.190 --> 06:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
that localities should be allowed to
 
06:46:14.750 --> 06:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
make these decisions for themselves and
 
06:46:17.090 --> 06:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
other times as in this bill it seems to
 
06:46:18.770 --> 06:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
mean that we in Concord are going to
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
make those decisions for them
 
06:46:23.390 --> 06:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
likewise with reference to the idea that
 
06:46:26.510 --> 06:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
a one size fits-all solution is not the
 
06:46:28.010 --> 06:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
right solution it's not the New
 
06:46:29.448 --> 06:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way this is a
 
06:46:31.910 --> 06:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all solution
 
06:46:35.150 --> 06:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
our towns our localities have specific
 
06:46:37.448 --> 06:46:37.458 align:start position:0%
demographics they have specific
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
geography they have specific interests
 
06:46:42.890 --> 06:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
and needs in cultures and I think it's
 
06:46:44.930 --> 06:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way to let them make
 
06:46:47.090 --> 06:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
these decisions for themselves thank you
 
06:46:49.250 --> 06:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Speaker and I ask for a
 
06:46:52.730 --> 06:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:02.448 --> 06:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and honorable
 
06:47:05.930 --> 06:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
colleagues we just heard a lot
 
06:47:08.208 --> 06:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
but let me tell you farms in New
 
06:47:11.030 --> 06:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have been around for since the
 
06:47:13.128 --> 06:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
beginning of New Hampshire
 
06:47:16.610 --> 06:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
they Supply our food we go to them for
 
06:47:20.330 --> 06:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:22.730 --> 06:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
we have more more and more people moving
 
06:47:25.670 --> 06:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
into our state that don't understand
 
06:47:28.128 --> 06:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
how farming is crucial
 
06:47:32.570 --> 06:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:35.990 --> 06:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't give Farmers an option
 
06:47:38.390 --> 06:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet
 
06:47:40.910 --> 06:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
are six percent food security that we
 
06:47:42.770 --> 06:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
can now Supply six percent of our
 
06:47:45.590 --> 06:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
population with local food will diminish
 
06:47:49.730 --> 06:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
and if you think six percent is good
 
06:47:53.750 --> 06:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
I beg you to take a look around
 
06:47:55.670 --> 06:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
and other states
 
06:47:58.128 --> 06:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
we need to support the local farmers no
 
06:48:00.530 --> 06:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
matter how we can
 
06:48:03.048 --> 06:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
and like I said we have a lot of people
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
moving into our towns that do not
 
06:48:04.860 --> 06:48:06.590 align:start position:0%
moving into our towns that do not
understand

06:48:06.590 --> 06:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:48:09.468 --> 06:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
the role character and
 
06:48:12.850 --> 06:48:12.860 align:start position:0%
how farming is a 24 7
 
06:48:18.288 --> 06:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:21.288 --> 06:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
it's not a nine to five job it's not a
 
06:48:25.610 --> 06:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
four to ten job it's 24 7. and it
 
06:48:28.368 --> 06:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the weather is I
 
06:48:34.628 --> 06:48:34.638 align:start position:0%

the determination in an acting of noise
 
06:50:15.110 --> 06:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance surrounding our farms and

agritourism solely on our state
 
06:50:19.310 --> 06:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislature therefore making it more
 
06:50:21.288 --> 06:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
difficult for local municipalities to be
 
06:50:23.930 --> 06:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
proactive if changes need to be made to
 
06:50:26.690 --> 06:50:26.700 align:start position:0%

I further know Mr Speaker that it has
 
06:50:33.650 --> 06:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
always been best practice to allow our

farmers and agritourism to speak
 
06:50:37.250 --> 06:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
directly to their municipality

yesterday in the wee hours of the

morning someone or some group committed
 
06:55:27.708 --> 06:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
a series of hate crimes in the city of
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth with more than 14 businesses
 
06:55:33.968 --> 06:55:33.978 align:start position:0%

everyone to condemn these hate crimes

and as there are indications that some
 
06:55:49.010 --> 06:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
of these hate groups have additional
 
06:55:50.868 --> 06:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
plans for additional acts of hatred over
 
06:55:52.010 --> 06:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
this weekend
 
06:55:54.350 --> 06:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
I ask us not only to condemn those acts
