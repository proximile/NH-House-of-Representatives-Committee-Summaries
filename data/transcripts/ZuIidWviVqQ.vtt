consistent with the other areas we've
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
prepared a entry for each of the
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
accounting units in excess of a million
 
00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
dollars on an annual basis and with that
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%

said I will hand the presentation over
to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
Karen good morning thank you my name is
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
Karen Hebert for the record uh director
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
for the division of economic stability
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh for allowing the time
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
for this uh presentation so the division
 
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
of economic
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
stability was established in
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
2018 there are several programs in this
 
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
particular division each of them has
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
their own objectives and methods to
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish those objectives as well as
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that are either
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
existing or in development so it's a
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
little difficult to present all of them
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
simultane ously as a unit uh and
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult to see how they're
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
interrelated but hopefully through this
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
presentation you'll be able to uh
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
understand that more so the one thing
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
they do have in common however is this
 
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
Mission which is to advance the health
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
economic and social well-being of
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
communities turn to slide
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
three these are essentially the key
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes of this particular division so
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
the services from the division of
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
economic stability lead to Stronger
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
Financial Health and stability and or a
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
reduction and prevention of poverty and
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
the need for public
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
assistance it's important to note that
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the services in this division can be
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
provided and are provided actually to
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
individuals from birth through the end
 
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.909 align:start position:0%
individuals from birth through the end
of

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
life there are some people who have
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
temporary needs While others have needs
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
from a particular point in time or for
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives or through their
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
entire lifetime
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
rather so the programs provide what you
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
see in the slide includes access to
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
resources for Life Necessities like
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
Health Care housing utilities food child
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
care they provide assistance and support
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
to reach Independence and self
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
sufficiency the services we provide
 
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
include work programs and educational
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for economic stability and
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
mobility and we have services that
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
well-being can we uh pause there sure I
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
I I love these kinds of slides just to
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
do a really great bird's eye view of the
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
whole program um um I think I understand
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
then in
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
2017 the the funding for this overall
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
area was
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
Zero uh which begs the question uh what
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
will the total General funds be for the
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
first year of the new budget so the
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
programs existed prior to 2018 but they
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
were developed or created and an
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
established single division in 2018 so
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
previous to that they were kind of
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
spread out in different areas of the
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
department so this was a consolidation
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
then in 2018 that's correct okay are are
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
you still retroactively able to figure
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
out what the total cost of them were
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
before consolidation or upon
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
consolidation I'm I'd like to be able to
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
understand the rate of growth in this
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
area over the last six years that's
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
where I'm
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
going if if we're only looking for the
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
past six years then we have all that we
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do some type of
 
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive um like modified approach to
 
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
that because we we would have all those
 
00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.149 align:start position:0%
that because we we would have all those
years

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted okay I I don't I don't want to
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
do the extra work I'm just looking for a
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
good period where we can get a rate of
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
growth so so 2018 was the first year of
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
consolidation where there was a
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
Consolidated number yes so so so if you
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
were to look at the past couple of uh
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
operating budgets you you could see the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
operating budget and you could pull the
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
spend and see that fairly easily okay so
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to know 2018 what the total
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh general fund spending was and then
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
what do you have u a summary already for
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
what this area is expected to spend in
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
budget for the for the entire division
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes for this page what what does this
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
page three cost sure
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
well so if you turn to page
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
budget you will see at the top there for
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see a summary of the federal
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
funds the general funds and the the
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
other funds in this
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
area and and just as a reminder the
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized is not the budgeted
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
amount um it is typically always higher
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
than the actual budgeted amount that was
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
in 25
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay so so correct me if I'm wrong then
 
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
okay so so correct me if I'm wrong then
for

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
26 the total General funds is 76.6
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
million that is correct okay that's a
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good base and you you don't
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
happen to know what the uh comparable
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
number would be for 2018 in that line
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
not off the top of my head okay we'll
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
figure that out later um and then
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
looking at these four
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
blocks um are you able to
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
um either provide an estimate for how
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
much money what as a percentage maybe
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
would be easi as a percentage that would
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
go into funding these four areas of of
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
operation like for example services that
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
encourage responsible parenting and
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
child well-being it feels like it's
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
maybe 8% of your total General funds
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
budget and in um in 26 but that's a
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
guess sure and I think it would be
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to guess so these four blocks
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
essentially make up some of the
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
highlevel uh objectives rather or
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
mission of the division as a whole right
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
so there's more than one program that
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
could be accounted for in any one of
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
those blocks right so be a little tricky
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
and then when we look at trying to
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
determine percentages applied to things
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
like contracts I'm not looking for um
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
rocket science what I'm looking for is
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
we just said that we want to spend 76.6
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
million on the total you know and I'm
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand the context of
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
the size and scope of the operation by
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
knowing what percentage of the general
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
funds is likely to be consumed by each
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
of those four areas and I understand
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
that there's some slopping back and
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
forth between lines but I I but be this
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
this is such a great slide to give us an
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
initial picture of what you do and how
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
much money you spend in the aggregate it
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
would be even better if we could see a
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a breakdown in each of these
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
areas um and if if you don't want to do
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
that now if you can't do that now then
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
we could we could take that later but I
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
would like to stare at it for for a bit
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
and help determine that like now go
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and look at it or do you want to
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
come back this afternoon I think one one
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
thing that that maybe we can do uh Ju
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
Just on the fly as we go through this is
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
as we look at the accounting units it it
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
seems that that the the focus is General
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
funds so as we go through the accounting
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
units we can identify those areas that
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
are General funds because within within
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
the dees budget you do have a mix of of
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
100% Federal for certain class lines you
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
have 100% general for certain class
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
lines um and as we go through that we
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
can identify those areas and try to call
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
them back here uh to this larger box all
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
right that that'd be good that that's
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
the that's the top down breakdown that
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to understand what
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve here was there a
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
question over here yes yes go ahead uh
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and uh thank you Miss
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
H uh representative Rich alveno from
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
chesher 9 uh I have a general top level
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
question what's a good working
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
definition of responsible
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
parenting can we just sck num
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
sure sorry I I just want us to do the
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
finance stuff and and to the extent that
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
we need to understand what they do so we
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
understand the numbers that would be
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
great but I don't want to like I'm fine
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
I can hold that be cha chasing side
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
issues I can hold that all right thank
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
you um unless you'd like to answer that
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
no I think that the answer will be
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
revealed uh when we get through some of
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
the the bureau's accounting units uh to
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
to understand the cont context of that
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
you so on slide four just basic gives
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
you a very basic organizational chart
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
for this particular division so with me
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
today I'm uh pleased uh for having the
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
division's deputy director uh Tina
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
Cabana who's in pink behind me uh and
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
several subject matter experts and high
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
level administrators from each area that
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
on Slide
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
Five I wanted to give you a bit of a
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
depiction of what our core values are in
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
this particular division uh I'm I'm
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to I'm just going to ask you to
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
keep moving uh till we get to numbers I
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
I I don't really want to spend a lot of
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
time on on on the the general overview
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
other than just we need to get down to
 
00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:56.949 align:start position:0%
other than just we need to get down to
the

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
numbers so so the next SL slide you
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
start to have numbers outcomes and
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
results do you want to talk about the
 
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
results do you want to talk about the
numbers

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
there slide
 
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
there slide
six

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
sure so this is related to the Bureau of
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
Child Development and Head Start
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
collaboration it's a long
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
name this particular Bureau essentially
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
enables access to child care to support
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
child care support New Hampshire
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and economic development in
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
the state the services in this Bureau
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
depend on state and federal partnership
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy programs to make child care more
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
accessible for low and moderate F income
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
families to so that they can look for
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
employment attend school mental health
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
or substance misuse treatment or simply
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
work children are eligible if they are
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire and residing
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
with a parent caretaker
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
under 13 years of age or under 17 years
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
disability so the outcomes in this
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
particular Bureau uh include uh a very
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
notable 45% increase in utilization of
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
what's known as the child care
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship that is the child care
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
assistance program also known as a child
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
care subsidy so this is really um
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
daycare costs right this is not a
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship as much much as it is we're
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
helping pay for daycare correct all
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
right I can't tell you where the name
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship came from but yes it's
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
beautiful marketing absolutely
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so 45% increase in the utilization
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
there which is pretty significant and
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's just in the last calendar year do
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
you happen to know what percentage of
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
daycare that the state is picking up are
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
we are we paying for 12% of our
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
population are we paying for 4 % so the
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
total general fund budget for this
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular area is 11 million uh I'd
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
have to do the math to get you the
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
percentage Yeah no I'm talking about the
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
percent of the population who are
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of this program compared
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
to the total are are we subsidizing 10%
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
of our state it's probably around 15% of
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
children who are eligible for this
 
00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:30.510 align:start position:0%
children who are eligible for this
program

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
okay question represent tki thank you
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can we can you
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
just give me a little bit of an idea on
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh the federal poverty level if you I'm
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
assuming that's how you qualify for this
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
scholarship it's based on state median
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
income median inome up to 85% of State
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
welcome so one of the other fun
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
functions of this particular Bureau
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
includes uh improving quality with
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
activities under a quality rating and
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
Improvement system that the bureau
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
administers and manages it's known as
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
Granite steps for Quality uh so this is
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
a system that has been around for about
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
3 years now and at the moment has 160
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
providers now enrolled in that
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
particular program what what causes
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
somebody to be enrolled that we have
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
quality concern and we encourage them to
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
enroll yes we encourage licensed and
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
licensed exempt programs to enroll in
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
the quality activities we want to ensure
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
that the uh providers are um have
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
current and complete upto-date training
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
and professional development of them or
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
just the ones that we're concerned
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
about uh so the system is voluntary for
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
programs yeah first they need to meet
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
certain requirements under
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for licensing uh
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
which is a different area of the
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
department sure but uh on top of that we
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
are encouraging people and providing
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
them with opportunities for professional
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
development that can enhance their
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
quality so how many providers are there
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
in the state if we've got 160 in this
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
program how how many are not in this
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
program so there are 717 licensed
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
currently and and so so far it's been
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
strictly voluntary for a program to step
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
forward and say they want to participate
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
you with equality uh includes
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunities
 
00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:44.549 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunities
for

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
credentials there are many different
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
credentials for CH uh Child Care
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
Professionals uh and in the last year we
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
had 1,200 professionals who added a
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
credential to their individual
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio so we're not doing the
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing we're encouraging and
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
keeping track if they go get
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
credentialed somewhere else correct we
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
have uh we are able to link them with
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
the providers who give the credentialing
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so so what our function is is to
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
help professionals know that these
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
credentials are available and and ask
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
them to self-report if they get one
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
correct we issue the certificates for
 
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
correct we issue the certificates for
the

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing okay thank you
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
mhm so you might be aware there have
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
been significant investments in child
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
care over the last few years in order to
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
stabilize and strengthen the industry in
 
00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:39.549 align:start position:0%
stabilize and strengthen the industry in
New

00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire approximately $171 million of
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh that began in co uh the co era uh
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
that has been uh received by New
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically for child
 
00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:55.549 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically for child
care

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay so a lot of the Investments that
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
have been made have essentially paved
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
the way for further growth uh and
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
further uh success in strengthening
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
child care in the
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
state on slide seven there are a number
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
of examples I'm not going to go through
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
them in detail but these are just a few
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
examples of what we have accomplished
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the covid related funding
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for child care it includes
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
support for family child care providers
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
small businesses um various uh one
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
notable is the gorm Community Learning
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
Center expansion there is a lot of need
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the North country and very little
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
Supply uh so this was a really
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
significant uh event that uh was or
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
Center that was expanded and established
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
for the North country that's serving Now
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
Families you don't know what that costs
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
do you think there Mr White do you think
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
there's a separate line item for the
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
gorm Community Learning Center or is
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
that embedded in some other line item I
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
I I could look into it to identify which
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
class line it's included in I I suspect
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's a a 102 or a 74 but I just need to
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
look into it to find the exact class
 
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
look into it to find the exact class
line

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying trying to do what I
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
do barely consistency is to understand
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the costs and
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
the benefits it's good to see the
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
benefits I just need to see the costs
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
that are going with it because that
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
implies a return on taxpayer investment
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
sure I understand so I'm I throughout my
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
presentation I want to give you a base
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
of information so that you understand
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
why the costs are are
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
there do you have a question represent
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
just had a comment or I guess a question
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
in response to you talking about cost
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
and benefit I think there's a economic
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
benefit that results from this
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
programming um and I don't necessarily
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
know if you're the person to actually
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
give us those data points but I guess um
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's something that maybe as a division
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
we would need to look into on the
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
economic benefit of these programs yeah
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear I am when I say
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
benefits I mean it in a in a bigger
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
picture but because we're Finance I
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
would like to the extent possible to
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
pull out and segregate the financial
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
impacts from the other uh softer
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that's a longer description of
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
my saying I'm interested in cost and
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
benefits okay and I'm guess I'm just
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
commenting that I think there's a a
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
bigger net of benefits that I think some
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
of us take into consideration so sure
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
yeah this is
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome back
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
on slide seven you've given us some uh
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
Matrix points on the Gotham Community
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
Learning Center and the out of state
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
time programs what about the quality
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
child care training do you have a number
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
of how many um facilities and you have
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
helped train uh to get their program up
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
to speed sure so this particular item is
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
a uh a project that was funded with arpa
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
child care funding okay uh so I can
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
provide you with the data with respect
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
to the outcomes of those projects uh
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
this was to give you a high level uh
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
understanding of of that and some of the
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
examples and I appreciate that and also
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh strengthening a family child care
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
would be another one I would like to get
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
some numbers on and can go back six
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
years or something like that as long as
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
you have the data um you don't have the
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
data you don't have the data but I I
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't these were very shortterm projects
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
covid funding covid related funding and
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
very shortterm like one year or less
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay great thank
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels thank you uh
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
could you could you define what the
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
under quality chalky what the
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
it is a particular pathway for early
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
learning there are multiple different
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
Pathways and models that child care
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
providers can give to uh that they can
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
use within their um uh establishment
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is one of a couple of primary
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
models I can get you a little bit more
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
of a better description uh if you'd like
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
to have that if you could please I can
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
slide eight essentially is to just give
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
you a bit of a visual this is the number
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
of children enrolled in the child care
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
scholarship program by
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
county and this is essentially one um
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
there are reasons why we're pursuing
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
more data collection with respect to the
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
so the the depiction here is probably
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
not surprising uh based on the number of
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
children involved in each of the
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
counties it looks like it's somewhat uh
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
based on the population of each region
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
but what we what we want to be able to
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand is that this could also be
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
demand or availability and accessibility
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
of programs in these regions so this is
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
a start to understand further what
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
information we need to gain to assist
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
more families so the data data
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
important who who who gathers this data
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's is that a person in your division
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
or is that somebody shared across the
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
department so this this comes from our
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire connections information
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
system which is managed by this
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau wh which division manages
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
that this one
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
right so this this isn't
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
data that's
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
also pull
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
or P collected and and an analyzed by
 
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
the depart the um office of Health
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
Equity because because this this implies
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
that there may be an equity issue here
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious where we're doing
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
data collection and Analysis and we're
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
trying to understand our demographics
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
and need it sounds like you're doing a
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
demographics and need assessment that's
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
separate and distin from what may be
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
getting done in other divisions we've
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
not yet brought the office of Health
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
Equity into an analysis but this is
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
where we ultimately want to go to be
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
able to identify First what are the data
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
points that we should be collecting for
 
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
the system and then conduct an analysis
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
of them okay what what's What's the
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
total number of children receiving
 
00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:22.750 align:start position:0%
total number of children receiving
daycare

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
support that is uh 4,032 children as of
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
the end of January
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
welcome so slide nine is another map of
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state which is a little bit more
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
interesting uh is this a number of
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
licensed slots I want to say slots
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's essentially um a a space the CH a
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
child could
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
be taking in that particular
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
facility so slots among providers who
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
are participating in the child care
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship program not all providers
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
participate in this program so graming
 
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.590 align:start position:0%
participate in this program so graming
zero

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
yes so this depicts very limited access
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
to and or supply of child care for
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
families with low or moderate incomes so
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
this essentially will help us strategize
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
around the use of the federal child care
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
Development Fund and how to increase
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
access represent priest thank you Mr
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank thank you for taking
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
my question um back to slide uh nine
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
again the
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
4,032 children are the children that
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
participates in your programs is that
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
correct that is the number of children
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
who we are paying for child care for
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
okay and do you know how what the need
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
is for the enti people that are coming
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
to you but you don't have the slots to
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
help subsidize their child care
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh so at this time we uh would still
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
have more utilization that could happen
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
with the Child Care Subsidy program so
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody were applied today for child
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
care they wouldn't be turned away it
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
would not be turned away correct not
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
today not today do you have that magic
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
number I do not you do not okay thank
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
slide 10 uh we can get more into the
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
in so for the first accounting unit this
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
is essentially the
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519 align:start position:0%
Bureau and it is uh briefing book is 878
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at that
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and since it's under $1 million in
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
funds uh it does not appear on the
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
book so this particular accounting Ute
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
funds and this is the fund known as the
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
child care and Development Fund issued
 
00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
by the administration for families and
 
00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:42.830 align:start position:0%
by the administration for families and
children

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
the second accounting unit is
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
specifically for the uh employment Rel
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's also known as employment related
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
Child Care there's multiple names
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
referred to the Child Care Subsidy the
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship program it's all the same
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
thing uh but here in the budget we refer
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
Care representative
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
walner thank
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
you so when I'm looking at this I see on
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
um protective preventive Child Care was
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
um area and
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
did notice when we were doing the
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
um budget last week and we were looking
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
at um the children and family area that
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
it had um it looked like it had
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
transferred over there yes yes that's
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
100% correct we we move those funds over
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
to DCF just to try to recognize those
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
costs in in the DCF realm okay I have
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
further question so will the providers
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
see any difference in the way that the
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
billing um is initiated or how they will
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
get paid now that it's moved over to
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
that other division could be more
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
streamlined just because less people are
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
involved in processing it okay great
 
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.269 align:start position:0%
involved in processing it okay great
thank

00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
represent go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned a minute or so ago
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
that right now the utilization isn't
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
fully taken up what is impact in terms
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
of federal funding when not as many
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
people are taking scholarships as could
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
does the money not come in or does it
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
come in and and and remain with us until
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
such time as it needs to be used yeah we
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
have it available it comes in the form
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
of a block grant that we receive from
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
the federal government so we have that
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
available so we're
 
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
constantly uh evaluating the use of the
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
childcare fund for the Child Care
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
Subsidy uh and then with that fund we
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
are required to spend 9% of it on
 
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.909 align:start position:0%
are required to spend 9% of it on
quality

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
activities we're also required to spend
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
3% of it on activities that relate to
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
infants and
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
toddlers of from those reserves and then
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
five up to 5% for administrative cost so
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
from there we look at what's left over
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
essentially where we could would look to
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
pursue expanded services that would be
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh assisting quality or do we look to
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
assisting providers for the last uh few
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
years because utilization has been low
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh but now growing but while it was low
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
we were able to take those particular
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and distribute them to child
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
purposes um represent nalco yes thank
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh quick quick question
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
on the Rel where it says um Head Start
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration what what is that is Head
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
Start is a totally separate entity and
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
then they interface with your division
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
correct so Head Start collaborative is
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
essentially that so we don't manage Head
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
Start we don't oversee funding for it uh
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's essentially what it's called just a
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative that the department has
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
with the Head Start Association in New
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that we're looking at
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
identifying what are the objectives that
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
we may have in common for Head Start and
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
child care in the State uh and really
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
participating in a lot of um uh
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
communication together building those
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
particular objectives and then ensuring
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
that we carry them out so we are we
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
receive a a small amount of money uh
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
$125,000 a year from the office of head
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
star federally that supports the
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative so we have one staff
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
person who works with the headart
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
association and the federal office of
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
Head Start to essentially look at the
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
objectives so that we are uh in
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
alignment with what the head Head Start
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
Association needs in New Hampshire okay
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
so just a quick one so so I take that to
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
mean that the funding covers our
 
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
expenses for the collaboration and
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's Federal money correct okay thank
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
you is it is it the case that on this
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
page 10 the only area where we're
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
spending any general funds of these five
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
topics is in the children develop Child
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
Development Area and that's uh almost 12
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
million in general
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
funds so yeah the general funds uh goes
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
towards the um uh employment related
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
child care okay so and that's in order
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
to meet uh required match ande for the
 
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.990 align:start position:0%
to meet uh required match ande for the
federal

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
funding O Okay so on that page the only
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
area when you say the the page do you
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
mean the slide or I'm slide 10 okay so
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
the other general fund essentially is
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
the last one which is the childcare
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce fund this is 100 just 100%
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
General funds okay this is a requ a
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
requirement out of hb2 from this bium um
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
or the 2024 legislative session
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
essentially that we would uh we would
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
put this into the budget uh and it's
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
need I'm not done yet but U I'll come to
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
you in a second representative PR okay
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm on page
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
882 um and
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
so the general funds for this
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
area um Mr White is that is that the 11
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
.9 million
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
yes now this says it's 100% General
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
funds but there's some federal funds
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
associated with this area am I what am I
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
missing I'm I'm looking at the wrong
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
things so so what what you're looking at
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
there that that's the total for the
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
activity of child development of
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
41111 0 so that's the summary there of
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
the preceding accounting units that fall
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
okay so so by us doing the child care
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce program that is not bringing
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
any any supplemental federal funds
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
correct right okay representative
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
question back on slide 10 um those
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
accounting units like Child Development
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
operations and child care development
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
quality assurance and head start our 100
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
% federal funds um as you know there's
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
reduction of funding going on in the
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
federal government and have you done any
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
scenarios what impact that would have on
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
these programs I mean the programs
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't be funded period I mean or if
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
they were partially funded and how many
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
people would be affected by that and
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state could pick up
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
and cover them and so I'm I'm interested
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
to what your thinking would be on that
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
so we're in communication with the
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
federal office of child care
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
regularly right now there really isn't
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
clear information over the uh of what's
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
expected for the future of this
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
particular fund there was a an
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry um that uh the U Administration
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
wants to know and understand what the
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
fund could be used for there is no
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
information yet I think they had like 90
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
days and this was a month ago to provide
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
that information to the administration
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
so there is no indication of anything
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
changing right now with this particular
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
fund so could it sure but at this time
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
we just don't have that
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
information what I would be interested
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
in again it goes along with um chairman
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
edwards's comments is just the number of
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
people and children that
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
you bet um you provide support for in
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
those three areas so that if we do see a
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
reduction in those areas we would have
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
come of an idea of how many
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
people would be affected by it and
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not and then would open up
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
the question of whether or not the state
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
would provide any funding and could help
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
in these areas so as of the end of
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
January there 4,032 children that are
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
being provided this service and that we
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
are paying for the majority of their
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
child care some of them do pay a parent
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
C share um but so there's 4,032 children
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
that if we lost the ccdf fund today
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
receive funding to support their child
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
care uh there's no other source from the
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
state to fund them otherwise uh so I
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
guess that would be a question for uh
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
for you all uh to or a determination for
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
you all to make if there would be other
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
funds that would support this program so
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
so so representative priest what I would
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
propose is that um we we think of
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions like yours um as we don't know
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
what we don't know yet so what should we
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
be doing as division three I think as
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
division three when we see federal funds
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
budgeted uh we should probably just go
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and assume that the that funding
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
is going to come whether it's in a block
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
grant or a line item but just for our
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
purposes of putting the budget together
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
I believe we need to assume that the
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds are coming knowing that
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
we're only a step in this process the
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
Senate's going to get this in the back
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
half of this term and more will be known
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh just as a clarification Mr
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um I agree with that we should
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
be acting in what we know but I come
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
from a field of urban planning
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
environmental analysis where we look at
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
the reasonably worst case and I'm seeing
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
now on the federal level what the
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
reductions are
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
happening um to other areas and since
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
we're in the midst of reviewing the
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
budget of the governor um the department
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
and us should be thinking
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
about what will happen if let's say they
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
do away with the block
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
brants to two states and I know it's not
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
in our purview we should be just looking
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
at the numbers of Governor but it could
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
happen next week could it happen next
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
month uh in the midst of our final re
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
utilization and so so if they don't have
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
the idea I mean
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
we it would be great to have those
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
numbers and and that's my justification
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
for asking for this information okay I I
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
the the division three is on the line
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
for submitting u a budget proposal to
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee and in order
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
for us to keep moving in a fairly direct
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
manner I I I intend to not go into the
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
assumptions of what the feds may do or
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
may not do to your point though is if we
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
get information before we're done with
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
our work we should definitely consider
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
the impact but I I don't see us spending
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of time doing what if worst case
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
scenarios okay thank you yeah um go
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
represent Waller go ahead we could just
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
go back to page 880
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
again 880 in the yes in the in the
 
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:48.670 align:start position:0%
again 880 in the yes in the in the
budget

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
book so this is the 100 you're talking
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
about the the quality one yes okay 100%
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
Federal 100% Federal
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
I was wondering um on the line of grants
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
for public assistance and relief what
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
would I mean that's a large increase
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
from 5 million in uh 25 to
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
um 11 million in 26 and I was wondering
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
what what we're anticipating there I
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
mean it is all federal
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
and but I was wondering what we're
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I have that was thank
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
you just wanted to get the dollars uh so
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
the um sure so for for uh class 74
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
grants for public assistance and relief
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh these essentially are uh a number of
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
different contracts that we will or have
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
or would continue to enter into that
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
provide quality activities and services
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
for child care
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
providers so it includes um uh web-
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
based health and safety
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
training uh it funds some of our uh it
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
funds our our data system New Hampshire
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
connections uh it funds professional
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
development activities it funds the
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
child care resource and referral program
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is significant uh that also
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
provides a number of professional
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
development opportunities including
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor apprenticeship ships
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that uh also includes uh the next
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
market rate survey that we will need to
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
do next year um and uh um uh also uh the
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
parent um information center family
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
voices for example um working with
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
families so that they have a voice in
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
this particular process about child care
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
so it has gone it is going up
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
considerably um and I wondered is this
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
um are the f is the federal government
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
saying this is how we need to use these
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds correct we have
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
to meet the federal Benchmark of
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
providing or using at least 9% of the
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
funds for Quality 3% for infant toddler
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh at least 70% has to used for
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
direct care uh and then the balance is
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
basically some discretion over what we
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
can use and we typically do it to to
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
fund quality but where we continuously
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate that would be if we're looking
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
at the potential of any unspent funds we
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave any money on the
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
table or return it to the federal
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
government so there are time frames in
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
which we then need to obligate the
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
funding and would look to other quality
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
activities to support the providers
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
directly okay do you know and can
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
you can you tell me is the $1 million is
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
9% of no that's part of it that's part
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
of it um I uh I don't have that
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
breakdown right off because for some of
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
the contractors they provide
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
both activities for infants and toddlers
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
And also quality for all of the
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
population there serving okay great
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman I may
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
have gotten a little bit confused with
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
that I I thought where that question
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
might be going is what is the basis that
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
we think there is such a dramatic
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
increase in federal funding um coming
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
pike just at the highest level so
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
essentially for the future uh we are
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the increase in
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
utilization and needing to monitor that
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
very closely uh where we ultimately will
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
need to consider bringing in tanif
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
funding to transfer into the child care
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
Development Fund to
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
support the utilization increase if the
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
trend continues to increase we want to
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
make sure these families are covered
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
with that particular
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy when that happens it essentially
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of money that to
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
benchmarks thank you all
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
again so slide 11 I'll introduce the
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau of child support for you these
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
are Services for Families of children
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
whose parents or parent caretaker do not
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
reside in the same household together we
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
serve both the paying parent and the
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
receiving parent or
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
caretaker essentially this program is
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
there to engage and assist parents who
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
are willing and able or perhaps unable
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
to support their children financially
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
and when necessary we enforce the
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility with parents who are
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
unwilling to support their children
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
financially so child support obligations
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
are determined by the court so this
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
program works very closely with the
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
court system uh to uh uh establish legal
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
orders of support and enforce
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
them we use a federally certified
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
automated case management system Sy for
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
child support as a number of interfaces
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
including with new heights uh and a
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
number of federal interfaces as well so
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
is New Heights the it system that you
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
rely on no no this system is called the
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
New England Child Support Enforcement
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
Nexus there are a number of strategies
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
that we use uh and collaboration with
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
Community Partners to try to reduce
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
barriers of the paying parent when
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
they're not able to pay we use our
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers to assist with
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
that we also use a a tiny Grant known as
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
the access and visitation Grant to work
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
with parents who are in dispute over
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
parenting or uh uh visitation
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling uh we also collaborate and
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
I'll talk later about the Bureau of
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
Employment supports with respect to work
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
programs and what they can do to support
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
the paying parents who need that kind of
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
support to find employment to pay for uh
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
the supporting their
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
children this Bureau essentially
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
believes in the responsibility of
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
parents to financially support their
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
children so we aim for quality service
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
and help those parents so so is that the
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
agency income the 1. 1855 that's that's
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
parents I think that's on uh page 80 83
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
estimated source of funds for Child
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
Support Services Agency income is 1.
 
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:46.230 align:start position:0%
Support Services Agency income is 1.
1855

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
million no th those are incentive
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
dollars that we receive incentive
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
dollars incentive
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
funds the federal government award
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
towards incentive funding based on
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
performance measures there are four key
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
performance uh indicators that then
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
determine based on the performance how
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
much should be awarded in incentive
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
funds the incentive is to do well in
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
performance so there's a range if we
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
performed poorly we'd get zero and if we
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
performed great we'd get much more
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
something like that correct we typically
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
earn about $2 million a year in
 
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
incentive fundings are we maxing out the
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
incentive or we in the midle range of
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
the incentive we we
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh it so the calculation for that uh is
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
also based on collections so I wouldn't
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
say we're maxed out um I'd have to C do
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
the calculation for
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
that would you give us a b are we doing
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
okay or we are we not or are we just
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
leaving a lot of money on the table here
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
I I might give us an A or a B I think
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
that we um
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
are doing well in collections the dollar
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
amount we collect however is based on
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
what's court ordered so if you have a
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
court order of $50 and we collect $50
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's a huge difference versus
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
collecting say $1,000 a week that might
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
be ordered for somebody else so the
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
collections are is a little bit um uh
 
00:54:29.069 --> 00:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
varies uh greatly year toe uh but the
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
performance metrics we have to meet
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
certain percentages in how much we are
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
able to collect how much we are able to
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
how many court orders we're able to
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
establish in out of the entire case load
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
universe so so there's 126 people that
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
work in this area uh what how many of
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
them are working on trying to drive up
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
our rate of collections I would have to
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
give you a percentage but it's the
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
majority of them majority of Staff
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
include those who are working in the
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
district offices as child support
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
officers or case technicians that meet
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
directly with clients to establish and
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
enforce the support orders okay so
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
between 60 and 70 of them are working
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
right so if you look at the at the
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes of approximately only 28,000
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
families are served
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
annually this last year we collected $78
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
million this is private funding uh
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
private money rather uh that were uh was
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
collected for families this essentially
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
helps them to be self-sufficient
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
stabilize them uh and uh need less
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance if
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
any but not only is this a cost
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
avoidance program it's also a cost
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
recovery program so we recovered out of
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
our collections last year $4.8 million
 
00:56:05.789 --> 00:56:05.799 align:start position:0%
specifically for tent to offset tan of
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures what happens is that we
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
have families when you receive the
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
temporary assistance for needy families
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh benefit it's an assistance cash
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
assistance program which I'll talk about
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
more later on but when you have a family
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
who is receiving the that tan of cash
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
benefit they are required by regulation
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
to cooperate with the child support
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
program to pursue child support from the
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
other parent um to help offset some of
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
those tanif
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
expenditures so when somebody is
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
receiving the tanif benefit anything
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
that we collect for child support during
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
that time is retained by the
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
state we never keep more than we receive
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen very often but when
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
we uh so when we retain the tan of
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
benefit the state retains a share of
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
that benefit which is which goes towards
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
tan ofe maintenance of effort the other
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
percentage is sent to the federal
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
accounting so this is this anara where
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
we got any waivers in to try to block
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
grant and streamline this process that
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
that that sounds very complicated like
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
we're spending a bunch of time and
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
effort in just doing the accounting for
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
this so the the this is where I think
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
the it system comes into play there the
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh Nexus system the the automated case
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
management system because we have set
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
within that system uh the the rules for
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
distribution so our system interfaces
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
with new heights and knows when somebody
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
is receiving tanif and when they're not
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
and then it knows what to do with the
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
collections that come in while they're
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
on TANF it knows what to do with the
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
collections that come in after they're
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
no longer on TANF it's a very
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
sophisticated system uh it takes care of
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
that distribution thank you you
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
welcome represent thank you Mr chairman
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of quick questions so the
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
28,000 that's that the trend on that has
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
been what over the last couple of years
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
up down um uh over the last couple of
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
years it's been declined it's it's
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
declining and same for the 78 million
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
that that would have declined with that
 
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.990 align:start position:0%
that that would have declined with that
no

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
actually so that trend is
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
looks the the the trend in New in for
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh has varied
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
significantly over the last decade or so
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
so there has been a decline in case load
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh since about 2019
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
um but we still seem to be collecting
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
approximately the same amount um so in
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh 2011 for example for uh we collected
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
83.9 million in 2023 it was
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
72.8 um
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
so but the thing to keep in mind with
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
the correlation with collections is that
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
all orders are not
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
equal so you could have a higher number
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
of orders for a lower amount than you
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
did last year um but we the those the
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
dollars are counted nonetheless so it's
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
not a uh it's not really something you
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
can match year to year because that
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
influences the numbers greatly thank you
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
you're welcome now now is it is it the
 
00:59:47.359 --> 00:59:48.750 align:start position:0%
you're welcome now now is it is it the
case

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
where it the system is set up so that
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
every parent who's ordered to make a
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
child support payment that that payment
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
must go to the state and the state
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
redistributes it is is is that this
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
setup uh almost so every parent who is
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
ordered by the court to pay child
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
support is not necessarily a parent or a
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
family who has applied for our
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
services so we have families who are not
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
recipients of tanif who don't apply for
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
services at voluntary they don't have to
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
use Services of the state many of them
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
do for a number of reasons so you have
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
to apply for services this is not an
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility program okay so it's not the
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
case that every collection has to go to
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
the state correct however with respect
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
to uh any if you've got parents who are
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
not going through the state who want to
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh set up payments by way of a wage
 
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.230 align:start position:0%
uh set up payments by way of a wage
garnishment

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
garnishment
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
those are required by law to go through
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
the state's dispersement unit which is
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
managed by the child support program if
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
you have parent a voluntarily paying
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
parent B and writing a check every month
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
then and they're reliable then that the
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
state has nothing to do with that
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
correct all
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
so we could go to slide 12 and look at
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit okay I I think we
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
could go to 13 myself because we've sort
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
of been talking about these
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
items we haven't talked about access and
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
visitation but that's 100% Federal with
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
so slide 13 essentially introduces the
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance starting
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
office the Bureau of family assistance
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
is actually made up of two large Parts
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
one of them uh uh oversees the
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
administration of business and policy
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
over Federal and State financial
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
assistance programs the other one is a
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
different uh a different group uh that
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
we will talk about um later uh but this
 
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
one specifically focuses in on the
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
business and policy side of the house so
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
to speak so this particular uh uh part
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
of the bureau oversees programs like the
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition uh assistance
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
program known as snap it oversees the
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
administ ministration for the temporary
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
assistance for needy families referred
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
to as tanif as I've been talking about
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
and also multiple State supplemental
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
programs uh that are state funded
 
01:03:06.839 --> 01:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
programs uh that are state funded
including

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
APD um you'll see in the block on the
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
right this gives you the count of
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
persons as of the end of January who
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
were in those programs I realize that
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
those are acronyms I'm going to give you
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the information for what they stand for
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
but essentially uh this is for our most
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations who rely on us
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
for basic needs so the this the summer
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
EBT program for school kids uh does this
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
director's office manages that as part
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
correct and then just I I I I'm not sure
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
what page in the budget book I'm on I'm
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
just curious how many people are
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
employed by
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
this this director's
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
office there are 16 positions within the
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
director's office there's 14 classified
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
unclassified and and what what I what
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
page number did you just uh so I was
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the Personnel count at the
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
 
01:04:11.839 --> 01:04:13.589 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
866

01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
866
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
you so there are several accounting
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
units in this particular area uh but I
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
will certainly talk with you a bit about
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
the administration of the federal and
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
state Assistance programs I will also
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
talk with you about the work
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements uh and programs that go
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
along with that uh and we can go through
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
those Associated budgets uh and then I
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
will dig into eligibility Services which
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
is the other side of the
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
house so the work of this particular
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
part of the bureau uh aims to achieve
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
these uh uh these needs that people are
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
individuals and families have because we
 
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
want um to provide a positive and valued
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
customer experience and a staff
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
experience that enables job
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
satisfaction slide 14 is a list of those
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
particular State supplemental programs
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
just so you have a bit about the uh what
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
defines those or description of each of
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
them and there is an accounting unit for
 
01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
them and there is an accounting unit for
each

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
parenthetically in the box to the left
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
on page 13 you say basic needs and you
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
refer to shelter food clothing and
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
utilities m is there is there also
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation that's in there it's just
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
not item listed so in uh so programs
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
like Medicaid uh through the man manag
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
organizations do provide for
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
transportation for people okay but this
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
this family assistance program isn't U
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.309 align:start position:0%

no representative priest thank you Mr
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%

14 um do you have the numbers of the
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%

through the state supplemental
Assistance

programs yes so on on slide 13 in that
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%

that would be great thank you um sure
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
also do you have any forecasting I know
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to look at
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
forecasting can but we're looking at uh
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me clarify you can look at
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
forecasts what forecasts are great we
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
need to look at forecasts I'm just
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
saying we shouldn't be looking at things
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
that we have no control of and know you
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
know like the right right I agree um but
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any um forecast for 2026 and
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
2027 for these uh for these different
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
programs uh So based on your knowledge
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
right so the um the the budget amounts
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
for State fiscal years 26 and 27 were
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
determined by projections that we had
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
made um I can get you the specific
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
numbers if that's that would be great
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
okay you're doing great you're on page
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
14 or so and I think this is a 36 page
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
deck yes how do you think you're doing
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
when what's your estimated time of
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
arrival at this
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
point uh so I imagine we are going to go
 
01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
into early afternoon okay so so just so
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
people listening to their gring stomachs
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
12:00 sounds good so I wanted to provide
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
you with a bit of
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
in yes yeah thank you um quick question
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
on on third uh page 14 on the bottom
 
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
approximately what size of the
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
population on Refugee assistant
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
assistance are we currently
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
number I don't that doesn't show on page
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
13 right it's not a separate I have
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
me of course it's the last
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
page so as of January of
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
2025 there were uh 162 adults and 85
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
children receiving the C cash assistance
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
cash is is that portion uh Federal uh
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
funded or we're doing that out of
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
General funds this is 100% federal funds
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
and you'll see if you look at the
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
revenue line in in the budget for the
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
accounting unit it's transferred from
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
the office of commissioner within o the
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
refugee Services account 729 sure sure I
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
just I just wanted to help put into
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
context what the impact of these numbers
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
are and if they're if they're still
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing with as Federal funding it's
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
less of a
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
problem less of a challenge is the right
 
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
problem do you have a followup are you
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative walner did you
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
have a question oh no sorry all
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
right so I wanted to provide some
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
information specifically about the tanif
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
program uh that may be of interest to
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
you so the temporary assistance for
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
needy families program or the grant
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
rather it is a fixed block grant for
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
States uh and there are federally
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
defined specific purposes for the use of
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
this block grant uh there are four of
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
them I won't read them to you but that
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
they are listed on that slide so so my
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
focus on this is going to be on number
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
four I I think I think historically what
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
we found is that we've had no tanif
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
programs that meet item four to
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
encourage formation and maintenance of
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
two parent families that we've had no
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
programs and I encouraged you all to
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
take a look at the Nebraska program to
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
see what they are doing to help two
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
parent families and to come forward in
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle with your proposal on
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
how to do something similar do you have
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
a proposal on how we're going to uh
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
emulate the Nebraska program or some
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
other program to help two parent
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
families this cycle so we're looking at
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
uh Services through the Family Resource
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
Centers to be able to support to parent
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
families that meet these percent so
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's yes you do have a new program
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
that you're you're going to introduce in
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle uh it's essentially uh
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
funding the Family Resource Centers to
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
expand a lot of the work that they're
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
already doing uh in supporting to parent
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to I can get into that a
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
slide but I I do want to just provide
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
some information about what uh makes up
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
funding so on slide 15 it includes
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds from the block grant in an
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
amount of approximately $38 million
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
this These funds must be spent on tanif
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
eligible families that meets at least
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
purposes the second part of the tanif
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
funding includes an annual state
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance of
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
effort that's $32 million of General
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
funds it's important to know that
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
whether the state spends $1 of the
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
federal funding or all of it the states
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
are required to uh spend the maintenance
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
million the third part of the Tana of
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
funding uh would be referred to as the
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
tanif balance it's not additional
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
funding that comes in it's essentially a
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
balance of tanif funds uh that has not
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
yet been spent um so that includes the
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
well represent yeah a quick question on
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the 32 million on the maintenance of
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
effort what what's that calculated off
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
sure sure is it a percentage of the of
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
what yeah go ahead the the the dollar
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
amount it's it's not a it's not a
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
percentage it's not based on a 5-year
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
history it's it's a fixed amount that's
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
been in place for decades um and and
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's important I I think just for for
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
new members of the committee to
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that we budget tanif across
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
the department um so that anybody
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
working on a tanif eligible tanif
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
related project can incur those costs
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so it one just just key thing that
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to draw your attention to here
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
last bium um there was uh the the the
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
house added $3 million each year of
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
General funds to ensure that we a to hit
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
thate um One Challenge that we currently
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
have in the existing budget is we do
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
have about 74 positions that are
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded within this Division and so
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
those unfunded positions we will be
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
unable to earn M Moe um or or earn or
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
spend General funds towards towards that
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
match for any of those positions that
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
are funded with General funds um So
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently we are in the process of
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
looking at um what
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
what what amounts are we potentially
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
short to meet thee and we haven't made a
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
final determination on on that yet but
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
we should have one done here in the next
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
two okay thank you so if we have to come
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
up with the 32 million and we have
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
vacant positions what happens to the 32
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
million do we do we just uh plow it down
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
to provide more programs to more um
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
clients so the money has to be spent and
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
think that's one potential way to do
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
that however that would require new
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
contracts and then those contracts would
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
have to be spent within the within the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
applicable time period uh but that that
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
is certainly a potential
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
challenge okay qu question for you I I
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a question to
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative walner uh representative
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
walner so my memory is horrible the the
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
the the the the the transition house
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
down in Manchester that we went to go
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
visit Waypoint uh that is there anything
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
in Waypoint that would qualify
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
for under the tanif program do do you
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
know Waypoint well enough to know that
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
if we if we put money into Waypoint if
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
oure maybe so I would need to look at
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the purposes that uh you
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
know some of their particular programs
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
right you know and services right fit
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
any of the definitions of the purposes
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
of tanif it feels like it kind of does
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
because you got younger people there 18
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.950 align:start position:0%
to to
24

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
um that you know well depending on which
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
definition of child you use it some of
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
that can can count um
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
and and these These are kind of needy
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
families that need a place to go that's
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
number one it seems so um so if you've
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
not looked at Waypoint as a
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
potential uh
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
creditable expense i' I'd appreciate if
 
01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
you would do
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
that okay and then represent
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
walner a couple weeks ago I think we we
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
heard in one of these meetings that
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
Waypoint did have some funding in the
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget and and you were going to try to
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
take a look into it would I know it's
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
off topic but I'm curious about what you
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
found on Waypoint we found and the
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
division as a whole we we heard it last
 
01:17:45.629 --> 01:17:45.639 align:start position:0%
week it was in
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
the was it the full 500,000 a year yes
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
it was okay so so that's a nice chunk of
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
oure if we get credit
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
if you've never looked at it before
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
let's let's take a look at that happy to
 
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.350 align:start position:0%
let's let's take a look at that happy to
so

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair yes last week
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's right it came up Waypoint is
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
102 all right well if we're going to
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
spend that money let's get some extra
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
credit for it representative Daniels
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh whereas Employment Security
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
does preparation for jobs and work it
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
can TANF money be be funneled over to
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
Employment Security so we're not
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
duplicating efforts I am going to talk
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
with you all about the Bureau of
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
Employment supports that we collaborate
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
with Employment Security specifically
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
for that purpose and yes it involves
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
Tanana funding thank
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
you represent priest thank you Mr
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
chairman just as a point of
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
clarification back on page uh is it 16
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
or 15 uh 15 I guess y um on thee if we
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't use the funding we lose it
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
right the the federal funds are carried
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
forward in in perpetuity um we we spend
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the oldest Grant first and then
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
we then go going forward and I think
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
what one important thing to understand
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
about thee that we haven't discussed yet
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
is if we don't spend oure then we will
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
see an equivalent reduction and we will
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
also see an equivalent penalty okay so
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
then the next year um you know then then
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're then you receive less funds and a
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
penalty so not only are you paying for
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
what you came up short in the prior year
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
but now you have to spend that and and
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a it's a spiral so what
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
once you once you have a year where you
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't spend thee it's hard to get out of
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
that over time okay thank you very
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
much one second so let's come back to uh
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
TANF ages on line item one for example
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
where it says so that families so
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
families so that children what what
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
what's the definition of child in that
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
what what's the age age range of a child
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
in that sentence it's up to age 18 uh
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
unless the child is still in high school
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
or equivalency to high school until
 
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.510 align:start position:0%
or equivalency to high school until
they're

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
19 represent torki thank you um I was
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
reading something recently and I'm
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
wondering how this fits if it fits into
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
tanif or if it fits in the child care
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship program um which is
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
assistance for children who have
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
children so a a mother a teen mother
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
um is there any special program or
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
benefit that assists them with automatic
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
Child Care scholarship so they can
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
education I don't think the criteria is
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
any different or extra in that
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance so they the the child that
 
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
needs the child care would still need to
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for the scholarship
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
program regardless of the age of their
 
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.709 align:start position:0%
program regardless of the age of their
parent

01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
or or the fact if they're living with a
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
parent the grandparent let's say sure so
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
when they're looking at uh income
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the program there are
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances when the grandparents
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
income may not be counted okay um but in
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
in all uh intents and purposes when the
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
three generations are in one household
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's not counted but otherwise it would
 
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:52.700 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you
 
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.990 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you
[Music]

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
so a a homework assignment I I'd
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if um if you would um take
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
a look again at the Nebraska
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
program and and come back and tell me
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
sort of in the F three or four major
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
bullets what does it do because I think
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
that program does more than just giving
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
money to the Family Resource Centers and
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
say do more I I think there there's
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
actually a program with objectives in
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
there have you had a chance to look at
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
that particular program I have not I'm
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
sorry oh okay um so I I think I emailed
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
all that information about six seven
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
eight months ago so maybe hopefully
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in your department
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
who's taking a look at it I will
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely look at that all right
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
representative walner yes I want to know
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%

representative w i just ask if there
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
were any circumstances in New Hampshire
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
where a two parent family could receive
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
tanii at this time there is it's um if
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
one of the parents is either
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
incapacitated or
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
disabled great thank you you're
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
questions all
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
right I'm I'm I'm I I shouldn't say it
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
this way but I'm I'm just a little
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
irritated because the last budget
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
briefing where we talked about tanif I
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out this number four and I I
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
said to please come forward in this
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
budget cycle with an explicit program so
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
we have a program that intentionally and
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
actively supports bullet 4
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
so I I I know you guys are really busy
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
but I I was hoping to to have a a
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint slide that says okay here's
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
do you did and I apologize for not
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
bringing that forward all right
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
represent walner I wondered if somebody
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
here who's had little history of New
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has there ever been a proposal
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the legislature around a two around
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
the two parent
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
program not to my
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge but my knowledge is probably
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
limited there is somebody in the
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
audience who think go go same thing just
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
take the chair and light up the mic and
 
01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
take the chair and light up the mic and
introduce

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
yourself Chris ananello associate
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm not sure if it was in
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature but I recall and Karen I
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
think um there's an issue with the work
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
participation rates because it's much
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
higher with a
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
twers with a two parent household than
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
we currently have now and we would have
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
that yes yeah I think the participation
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
rate goes up to 90% for two parent
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
family which yes which is why we stopped
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
doing the that particular program a few
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
years ago because we couldn't meet the
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
rate and we get penalized for not
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
meeting it
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
I thought we had had a program or had
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
had it proposed in the past okay thank
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
you but but I think that's why if we
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
look at something uh that we can um
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
develop those services that is not
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
directly the benefit we are providing
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
from the Department if we use Tana
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
funding to support services outside of
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
what we do internally that's where we
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
may be able to to do something
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
different thank you so so I'd like to
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
propose that you you take it away to
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
come up with another PowerPoint slide or
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
something that would specifically
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
address for and then attach that you can
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
come in and spend like eight minutes on
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
some other division 3 hearing that we
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
have I'd be happy to okay and then you
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
know M Mr Whitey and Mr Ripple will
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
figure out which which one would be the
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
most appropriate to tack you on but I I
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
I do I do want to take a second dip at
 
01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
I do I do want to take a second dip at
that

01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead so slide 16
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
essentially gives a bit of a a highlevel
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
overview of the different areas that
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking for for uh tanif uh
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
spending so while we will put together a
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
more formalized plan for this I can tell
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
you that the um the the federal
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
government expects that states will
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
invest primarily in cash assistance uh
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
and work programs uh and education so
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
this includes barrier reduction uh to to
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
lifting families out of
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
poverty uh and also reduces incidents of
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
involvement with the child welfare
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
system so those are some of the key uh
 
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
focuses of the funding that the federal
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
government is
 
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.510 align:start position:0%
government is
expecting

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
um we want to ensure that we're
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
identifying how to best measure outcomes
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the tanif funding activities uh and
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
what data to collect so in a plan I will
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate that um more
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
specifically um so these particular
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
items so between cash assistance and the
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment program um then
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards we're looking at the uh
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Center support including
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive Family Support
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
Services which is a lot of Home visiting
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
services and prevention prevention of
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
child welfare
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
intervention um and then Family Planning
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
looking at educational programs for
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
adults and
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
teenagers we are funding uh a small
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
amount for reunification of family
 
01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
engagement for children who are in
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
foster care right now uh we provide
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
funds to Social Service uh uh transfer
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the Social Services Grant and then of
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
course looking at transferring Tana
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
funding for the child care and uh the
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
rather on the 16 you have Family
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
Planning listed
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
M who who who who are some of the key
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
vendors currently providing these Family
 
01:29:09.119 --> 01:29:11.470 align:start position:0%
vendors currently providing these Family
Planning

01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
Planning
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
services that is a good question I will
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay I I just have a quick follow-up
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
question to that what what's the nature
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
of the services
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
provided uh it's a lot of um so for
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
teenagers for example um prevention of
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancies um um abstinence programs so
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
really that that's the focus of those so
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
so to get to the implicit point this is
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
not paying for abortions
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
no was that your question
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's probably right no
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
only slide 17 I wanted to give you a
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of data um this comes from
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
our federal partners that collect data
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
from States uh this the the the the most
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
recent data that they publish is from
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
2023 but I would say it probably hasn't
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
changed so much in the last year um but
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
I think that this gives you a bit of an
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
idea of the effectiveness of the
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
services uh not necessarily
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the program because
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to measure uh but also
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
the accountability of the services that
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
are being provided so if you look at
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
2023 14% of uh the uh uh recipients of
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
tanif gained
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
employment 9 and a half% uh found
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
themselves over income for the program
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
and that could have been from anything
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
from Child support payments started
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
coming in or other uneed income like
 
01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
coming in or other uneed income like
Social

01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
Social
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
Security there uh is an interesting
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
number here of the nearly
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
40% who closed their tanif program
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
because they were weed uh not in
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with any particular
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
requirement so if you're going to be
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
receiving TANF certainly you have to
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the child support
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
program um there are teen parent
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
requirements you have to develop a work
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
plan and work with the New Hampshire
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
employment program we've got some people
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
who don't show up for appointments or
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
didn't submit proper
 
01:31:37.229 --> 01:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
verifications so but that's an
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
interesting number because I think that
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
it leads us to ask some of the questions
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
about well why uh did those things
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
happen uh are we explaining things well
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
enough to people uh where should we
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
focus our efforts in making any
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
do you you you probably at some point
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
Benchmark these against other similarly
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
sized and situated States just to see
 
01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
how we're how these numbers in isolation
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
is are just data there's no way to
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
interpret this without a benchmark yeah
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
I like to look at States particularly in
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
the mid Midwest because they seem
 
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
comparable to New Hampshire more than
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
other states um so
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
comparable representative
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman again I'm
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
back on page
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
16 um do you have actually numbers of of
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh families or individuals that you
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
provided assistance with for each of
 
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.790 align:start position:0%
provided assistance with for each of
these

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
programs and then my second question is
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
do you have the data for um on slide
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
2024 so on the data on SL 17 for 2024 I
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
can get for you this was most readily
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
available directly from the um Federal
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
website uh but we have the data for 24 I
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
just need to have it pulled from the
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
system for you what about on page um 16
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
do you have like the number of people
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
you've served so I benefited from these
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
Services I do have um some numbers for
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive Family Support
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
Services I think that was right on the
 
01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.109 align:start position:0%
Services I think that was right on the
slide

01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
1,158 families uh that were served by CF
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive Family Support uh I
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
will have to get numbers for the other
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
items such as the re be great thank you
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
so much short represent no vanum just a
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
very quick question I realize there are
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of variables in these on the page
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
17 you on that the on the right hand
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
side there but is that you know uh
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
patterns that look similar or the are
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
there any major areas where the patterns
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
have changed over the last five years um
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't think significantly enough I
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
think this is relatively consistent be
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you with I guess some
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
of that may show up in the 20 20 24
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
numbers that uh representative priest
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure so should I be concerned that it
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
looks like only about
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
25% of tanif is being successful I mean
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
if you define success as gaining
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
employment or making the income or
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
resources to no longer qualify if you
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
define that as success we we only got
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of the people
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
participating in TANF graduating with
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
honors what what
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
what how how do how how do we think what
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
how do you think about that
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
number so I think that we need to do um
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
more as far as how we determine the
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
outcome metrics for uh things like the
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
work program that TANF is funding so how
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
do we know the program is effective are
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
people staying in their employment um
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
and for how long so they're actually new
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
metrics being put into place for the
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
system right now uh that are not
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
complete uh But it includes measuring
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
people's um uh the outcome of of the
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
employment rate for example two quarters
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
after they exit the tan of program and
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
then again four quarters after they exit
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
the tan of program uh so and then
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
looking at comparable um uh data of
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
their earnings uh so when they exited
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
the program and then after a period of
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
time like the second quarter or six
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
months after that what is their income
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
looking at that time so this is
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration also with the New
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security uh to be
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
able to uh receive that particular data
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
we also want to look at the uh
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
achievements people have been able to
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
make after tanif uh with respect to
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
their education so how many people are
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
attaining a high school diploma or an
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
equivalency for example after they've
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
exited the program within the first
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
year do you consider trade schools also
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and not just uh high school and and
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
colleges or going and attend getting a
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
trade that that counts right uh that is
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually not part of the metric today um
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
or that's being planned right now it's
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
basically based on High School uh uh
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
graduation or equivalency of high
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
school okay you're so you're not looking
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
at like going on and getting an
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
Associates or The Bachelors
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
or no okay all
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
right did you did you tell me what you
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
think about that 25% you think we can do
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
a lot better than that do we think
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
that's a that's probably it's natural
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
state we should learn to be satisfied
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
with that so
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's helpful to know and and and
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
understand that we're well first we've
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
we've been Limited in what we've been
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
able to measure as far as looking at
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
outcomes and success but one of the
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
primary metrics for the tan of program
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
and the Employment Program is the work
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
participation rate so how many
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
individuals are actually participating
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the work program which includes
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
they're either working or they are
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
participating in activities to find and
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
gain employ employment or they're going
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
to school so right now we have a higher
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
participation rate than we have had in
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
years it's over 69% at the moment um we
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
have to have a minimum of 50% per the
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
federal programs requirements uh but we
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
at the moment have just over
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
69% participation rate so so that sounds
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
like the good news I'm not seeing that
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
on your slide it's in the Bureau of
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
Employment support sorry it's in a
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
future slide oh okay all right preview
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels thank
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
you I hear you talk about the the
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
employment and going back and checking
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're still employed
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
x amount of time later which is things
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
that Employment Security can do but I
 
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
haven't heard you talk about the
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
39.4% that don't fulfill the requirement
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you find trying to find out why
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're not doing that right so and we
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
don't track people after they close in a
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
program we simply just don't track
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
people after we're not providing them
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
with a service anymore that's what makes
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
it so difficult to determine how
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
effective this program is um I think we
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
end up having to uh either do our best
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
to try to understand based on feedback
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
we get from clients based on uh uh
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
forums or uh any kind of a a study that
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
we can conduct with various populations
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
about why uh they made decisions that
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
they did in order for us to improve
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
programs those are very limited it's
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
limited feedback uh because it's tough
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
to to get people to engage when they're
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
department

01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
proceed so I will go to slide 18 which
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
essentially introduces a little bit of
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
work requirements um uh for the family
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
assistance program under this uh this
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
area so this has to do with the snap
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
program supplemental nutrition uh
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
nutrition assistance program so there is
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
a requirement for recipients of snap um
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
a particular population of them uh that
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
we refer to uh this is a federal term as
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
able-bodied adult without
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
dependence so these are people who are
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
at least 18 between 18 and 55 who are
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
fit to
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
work do not have a minor child in their
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
household uh and they have to meet
 
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
certain uh requirements work
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
requirements in order to continue
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
receiving the SNAP
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
benefit so the requirement includes 80
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
hours at least a month of either work or
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
being actively participating in a work
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
program or educational program currently
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
there is 281 individuals doing
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
that and that is
 
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
um the number of people who are
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
determined to be able-bodied adults
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
without dependence um comes from a uh
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
the population of the snap uh recipients
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
snap recipients it's over 70,000 people
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
right now but we carve out just those
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
individuals for these work requirements
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
who fit this definition and this
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
criteria 18 to 55 uh who don't have a
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
minor child in their household so it's a
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
much smaller segment of the snap
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
population where does that age bracket
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
government and in this case it's the US
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and the food
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
and nutrition service uh branch of that
 
01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.669 align:start position:0%
and nutrition service uh branch of that
uh

01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.669 --> 01:42:06.679 align:start position:0%
Department there is a time limit that we
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
track where folks are allowed up to 3
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
months of the benefit if they're not yet
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
working or participating in a work
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
program or they're exempt from
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
participating for some reason so right
 
01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
now there is 560 indiv uals who are not
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
yet participating in a program and will
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
need to or they will lose their benefit
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
after 3
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
months representative priest for a
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam uh Vice

those who are between 18 and
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
55 but um who are Able Body adults
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
without any children do you have any
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
programs for this same statistic but
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
with children with
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
dependence yes so we have an employment
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
and training program specifically for
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
SNAP recipients okay uh that is
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary for SNAP recipients and that's

to build and I going to talk about that
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit and how new is it um and do
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%

representative could you make that
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
available to us so we just have that
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%

on to 19 I have completed 19 but if you
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
have questions of course no there's that
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
70% figure on the tan of participation
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
rate what what what tell tell me what
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
that means outcomes and results you got
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
a a 70% tan of participation
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
rate which slide are you referring to
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 19 I'm not sure how to
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
what it's it's like there's a word or
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
two missing from that
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
bullet oh I seem to the bottom right
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
hand corner of page 19 outcomes and
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
results yes so
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
um the yeah near 70% participation rate
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
that is the number the percentage of
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
recipients of TANF who are participating
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire employment program
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
um got it and and that's you think
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's the right number or do we want
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
that to be 85% or
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
something uh so that's the the that
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
number is the highest it's been for many
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
many years but of course we want to
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
continue uh to increase that all right
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh
 
01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.709 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh
representative

01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman uh along
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
with that question do you have numbers
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the previous years that we can see
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
the um increase rates on these items of
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes and results sure and again
 
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations and getting an 8.2
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
increase that's
 
01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:39.070 align:start position:0%
increase that's
great

01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
certainly so this really is where we uh
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit more of the Bureau
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
of Employment supports and what it does
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh which is really uh working with
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who are re recipients of
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
tanif and snap uh who are required to
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
participate in work activities so that
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
they can
become

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient uh so we have both the
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment program and the
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
snap employment and training program
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
both are in order to uh accomplish the
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
same thing uh gain work experience gain
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
work uh employment uh and obtain
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency so this program works
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh directly with employers uh and
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
educational training organizations uh
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
the workforce Innovation Opportunity Act
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh group under their state plan New
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Employment Security Department
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
of Business and economic Affairs and all
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
needs so using tanif funding New
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is well invested in employment
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
supports for tanif recipients so the
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
department administers this program for
 
01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
its for low and income uh low-income
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
families who have children and the goal
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
is to basically end their dependency on
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
public assistance and promote job
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
preparation and employment so the career
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
counselors as these staff are called uh
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
are highly trained they provide services
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
on Workforce Development education case
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
management and reducing barriers to
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
employment uh and prepare people for
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
industry specific
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you thank you
 
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you thank you
you

01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman quick question do you
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
have you have any issues and any people
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
that look at the question of abuse in
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
programs or do we have questions Fraud
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
and Abuse so I think we're we're
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
constantly keeping our eyes open for
 
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
that and sometimes we receive reports
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
from Anonymous sources or from uh people
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
that might know something uh that report
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
things to us that are then referred to
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
our special investigations unit is that
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
significant as a follow-up question you
 
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
see that as a significant issue or or
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
not no
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
um I have some information about that
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
bear with me and while you're looking at
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
that who who is the special
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
investigative division so that falls
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
under the division of program quality
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh with
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
mer to lose yes so essentially when
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
there is a misuse of tanif funds uh the
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
federal government can assess penalties
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh with the individuals or institutions
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
that might uh have been at fault for any
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
kind of fraud so uh what we know of in
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
other states uh and this data is is a
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
few years old uh however it it it may be
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
still relevant in 2020 there were
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
charges brought against six State
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
officials for misappropriating T of
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
funding New Hampshire is not one of
 
01:51:03.119 --> 01:51:03.870 align:start position:0%
funding New Hampshire is not one of
those

01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
States uh in Mississippi there were
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
eight criminal defendants and 47 civil
 
01:51:11.229 --> 01:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
dependents that the Department of Human
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
Services is suing in an attempt to
 
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
recoup $77 million and stolen and
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
misspent federal funds so we have
 
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
preventative measures and monitoring
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
activities under state law uh and rules
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
for penalties of anyone who is misusing
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
um uh tan of funding and we have an
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
admin an electronic benefit transfer
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
administrator who is monitoring that
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
activity uh based on the transactions
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they are looking at uh we have
 
01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.149 align:start position:0%
that they are looking at uh we have
restricted

01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
locations uh for uh example certain
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
business types that are blocked uh that
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
may be close to uh ATMs to establishment
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
such as liquor stores Casino or gambling
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
establishments or any retail
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
establishments that provide adult
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
oriented entertainment smoke shops
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors marijuana
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
dispensaries uh so I can say that
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
between December 1st of 2018 through
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
September 30th of
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
2023 and I can get you some updated
 
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but not a single transaction has
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
been attempted at a restricted location
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
ju just a quick follow and this purely
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
observational anecdotical I see you know
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes the places that I frequent
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
personal AC places that go in and out of
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
the you know you'll see a sign that you
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
know they were accepting EBT and they're
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
no longer accepting EBT and I you know
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
kind of curious as to why um uh
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
businesses or places where at one point
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
are accepting and at another time not
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
accepting there issues with the with the
 
01:52:56.189 --> 01:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
how they're reimbursed or the funding or
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
anything that would would cause that
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a pattern no I I think that the
 
01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:03.639 align:start position:0%
um federal government that includes the
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
US Department of Agriculture for snap
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
and the administration for children and
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
families for tanv really look at a
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
variety of ways they can promote the
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
utilization of SNAP benefits uh in
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
particular or tanif benefits so I think
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
that that's essentially uh
 
01:53:26.669 --> 01:53:26.679 align:start position:0%
arrangements for promotional public U
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
materials uh that that promote those
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
programs from those establishments so
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
grocery stores for example we'll make a
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
note of that um I I see them in various
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
places as well but that's not
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
administered by the
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you maybe you can help me
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
reconcile some of the numbers you have
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
on page 19 you you you indicate that
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
close to 70% of the tanif participation
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
rates in employment programs but yet on
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
page 17 only 14% have gained
 
01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
employment so I'm does that that mean
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we we have 56% of them that don't
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
gain employment so it it's fluid so you
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
may have um individuals who have gained
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
employment uh from numbers that were
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
were um uh put together from 2023
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
information this 70% of tan of
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
participation rate is as of
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
2024 um so the participation
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
rate doesn't necessarily mean they have
 
01:54:40.159 --> 01:54:41.709 align:start position:0%
rate doesn't necessarily mean they have
found

01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
employment they could be participating
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
in the Employment Program and doing what
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do but maybe they
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
haven't found work yet and I and I
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
understand that and but even one year
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
apart and the fact that 70% are in
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
training but the previous year only four
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
14% gained employment it it seems like
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
maybe something isn't working with the
 
01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.589 align:start position:0%
maybe something isn't working with the
training

01:55:10.589 --> 01:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
programs and that goes back to wanting
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're collecting the
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
right data so that we can report out on
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
that and it's really difficult to do we
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
just initiated a uh um a post tanif
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
program that's very new uh it it's being
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
done in a few other states as well but
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's a very New Concept to try to work
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
with people after they've closed tanif
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
in order to track them and how well that
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing whether they've gained
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
employment or they're still searching
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
that is a voluntary program uh that we
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
would track people who volunteer for
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
that for a year after their tanif
 
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
benefit closes so hoping we could
 
01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:55.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps gain some better understanding
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
as to what the effectiveness is here
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
um let's see where should I go next uh I
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we looked at the um
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
y go ahead representative thank you Mr
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
chair I I wasn't going to ask this but I
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
am you then I second thought I'm going
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
to ask it are there
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
any any of the uh any disincentives
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
built into the uh eligibility
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that would for example
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
would discourage somebody from looking
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
for full-time work and I'm looking at
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
the 80 hours a month if you go over a
 
01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
certain threshold uh are there any um
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
situations where you know not going to
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
work would would reduce the amount of
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
total uh income you have and and if
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
there are what you know what can you do
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
to eliminate disincentives right so
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
couple of things so for that uh
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
able-bodied program for
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
example uh somebody would be uh able to
 
01:57:15.149 --> 01:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
receive up to three months and it
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be consecutive months up
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
to three
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
months that if they're not participating
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
in a work program or working they would
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
lose their benefit it would
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
close for the tanif program if they're
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
not meeting certain requirements so
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
somebody is supposed to uh participate
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the work program and they're not then
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
they would face sanctions that
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately starts with a reduction in
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
their Grant and could lead to uh the uh
 
01:57:44.639 --> 01:57:49.870 align:start position:0%
their Grant and could lead to uh the uh
benefit

01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
closing thank you welcome all right so
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
so now you're on 19 beginning Bureau of
 
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.149 align:start position:0%
so now you're on 19 beginning Bureau of
Employment

01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
Employment
 
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
supports uh yes uh unless you want to go
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
through the accounting units for the
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance director's
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
office so so this is what I'm thinking
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
since we're going to have to come back
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
anyways this is as good a stopping point
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
as anyway to keep the Integrity of your
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
presentation together so we can complete
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
a section so so so I think uh we should
 
01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
take um a recess to to go get some food
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh how much time do you think uh we need
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative tersi 45 minutes come
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
back at
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
12:45 that sounds okay all right do do
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
you does a department have any issues
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
with coming back at 12:45 no all right
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
um all right so with that uh we're in

02:47:50.269 --> 02:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
warning all right it's it's uh 12:45 I'm
 
02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
going to bring division 3 out of recess
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
we'll pick up where we left
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
off page 19 of uh the Department's slide
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
deck um and uh welcome back hope
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
lunch thank you uh so I wanted to just
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
um uh for a point of clarification
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
because I think it would be really
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
helpful on um one of the tanif slides
 
02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:29.630 align:start position:0%
helpful on um one of the tanif slides
specifically

02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um slide
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
17 the data that's there with respect to
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
percent percentages of various
 
02:48:40.750 --> 02:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's actually
 
02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative of cases that have closed
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
for those reasons in that year and I
 
02:48:49.630 --> 02:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
didn't write that I didn't so I wanted
 
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that was clear and it
 
02:48:57.550 --> 02:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
confusion I I I thought it was clear
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
enough but appreciate the clarification
 
02:49:05.790 --> 02:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
I it it totals to about 100% so I I
 
02:49:08.429 --> 02:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
figured it was meant to be inclusive so
 
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
right yep those are reasons for cases
 
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
tanif uh so uh I think we could move to
 
02:49:18.359 --> 02:49:21.309 align:start position:0%
tanif uh so uh I think we could move to
slide

02:49:21.309 --> 02:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
20 which takes us back to the um
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
accounting units for the direct starting
 
02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
office if there are any questions on
 
02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:54.990 align:start position:0%
office if there are any questions on
that

02:49:54.990 --> 02:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
just excuse me thank you just one quick
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
comment that's where we said I think
 
02:50:02.190 --> 02:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
previous earlier this this in this
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
morning session that there were what 741
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
positions in there and 47 417 of those
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Nathan white Chief
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services So within the
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
division of economic stability and the
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
governor's State fiscal year 26
 
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
recommended budget there's
 
02:50:32.349 --> 02:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
587 and and I believe uh there's
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 74 73 that are unfunded
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
division okay so I'm I'm that where is
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
that in the in the book
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
it's included in those uh so if if you
 
02:50:55.469 --> 02:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
look at page
 
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
885 of the governor's uh recommended
 
02:51:01.630 --> 02:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
budget ah okay at the end um you'll see
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
the totals for the division uh both in
 
02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
terms of dollars as well as the
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified full-time
 
02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:08.950 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified full-time
authorized

02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
positions okay thanks I was just on our
 
02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:21.429 --> 02:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's very quick followup those are all
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
funded in that in those numbers no so so
 
02:51:28.110 --> 02:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
there there and I've been corrected uh
 
02:51:32.229 --> 02:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
there's 73 unfunded positions that are
 
02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
included in that total thank you and and
 
02:51:36.990 --> 02:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
those dollars have been removed from the
 
02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
from the class 10 and class 60 uh lines
 
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
so so the the the reduction in in
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
funding is is reflected in the totals
 
02:51:51.790 --> 02:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there's a reason for this
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm just looking at um on page 866
 
02:52:03.229 --> 02:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the of the budget book under um
 
02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
grants for public assistant and relief
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
074 there's 1.1 million
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
there um and this is under the
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
director's office so I'm just curious
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
about the placement of that size account
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
doing grants in a director's office
 
02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be under more of an
 
02:52:23.439 --> 02:52:24.830 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be under more of an
operational

02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
operational
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau that specifically funds uh a
 
02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
contract for SNAP education which is
 
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:40.269 --> 02:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
funds okay so so there's not a different
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau for SNAP education this is the
 
02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
most logical place to put that correct
 
02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:49.309 align:start position:0%
most logical place to put that correct
okay

02:52:49.309 --> 02:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
I I I I do have a question about
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
education in general and maybe maybe you
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
could uh bring me back to this uh Mr
 
02:52:59.550 --> 02:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
White because you you picked up on some
 
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
of this last budget cycle we we had um a
 
02:53:10.269 --> 02:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
group in public health that did um
 
02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
public Communications did you know sort
 
02:53:14.510 --> 02:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
of Outreach
 
02:53:16.750 --> 02:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
messaging then we had a special source
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
of money that came in and we decided
 
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we were going to set up I think
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
sort of I think it was a um the brain
 
02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
disorder a separate PR program and they
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
ran in parallel one of the things I said
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
was I'd like to see only one Department
 
02:53:38.590 --> 02:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
in the dep in the Department of Health
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that manages sort of
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
public facing Education and
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
Training and I and I know that not in
 
02:53:52.349 --> 02:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
here but um talking about education here
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
just triggered that thought sure are you
 
02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
referring to the public awareness
 
02:53:58.429 --> 02:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
campaign on brain health Alzheimer's
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
disease and related dementias yeah yeah
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was a special project and it was
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a onetime project because
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
there was no marketing collaterals and
 
02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
they just needed to be
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
some what what what did we do with that
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
did they we roll that up into something
 
02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
else for the coming budget or did we
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
ongo it no so that was a onetime
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
appropri of
 
02:54:22.229 --> 02:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
$500,000 um I believe it was it was made
 
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
out of the um the Surplus uh funds from
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
State fisc year 23 so that has not been
 
02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted going forward perfect thank you
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
sorry Miss Hebert I I rained on your
 
02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
parade no representa
 
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
walner thank you I'm just wanted to pick
 
02:54:47.150 --> 02:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
up on something that um Mr White just uh
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
sort of alluded to
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
um the 73 unfunded positions and I
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
should have asked this in more not just
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
here but throughout when we've been
 
02:54:58.229 --> 02:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
going through the
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
budget how do we how do we decide which
 
02:55:04.590 --> 02:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
are unfunded and what is that going to
 
02:55:08.349 --> 02:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
mean for um a division like this when
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
their uh Workforce is that reduced sure
 
02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
their uh Workforce is that reduced sure
so

02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
um there's there's two pieces of statute
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
that are really critical for the
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
Department to be successful um one is
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
currently in RSA and and that's the
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
authority that allows us to fill
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions the second piece is
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
currently in hb2 the final hb2 should
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
should be out here soon um that allows
 
02:55:38.349 --> 02:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
us to move money out of between
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel lines essentially and um the
 
02:55:44.429 --> 02:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
department has a central team that we
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
utilized during the last hiring fre
 
02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:48.750 align:start position:0%
utilized during the last hiring fre
where

02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:55:51.150 --> 02:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
basically we have a centralized process
 
02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
where requests come in and we look
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
globally at the Department's needs so
 
02:55:57.990 --> 02:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we look at what are the overall
 
02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
operating needs um and there it's it's
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
certainly a bit of a balance as far as
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
posting the right positions and looking
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
at what are the needs in the community
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
what are the needs what are the support
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
needs what are the Direct Care needs
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
that you know certainly takes precedence
 
02:56:15.910 --> 02:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
and importance there um so there's
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
certainly no good answer but we do do
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
already have a process in place to try
 
02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
to address this as dynamically and
 
02:56:26.670 --> 02:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
nimbly as as we
 
02:56:29.469 --> 02:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
can so
 
02:56:32.590 --> 02:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
um in a division like this
 
02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.469 align:start position:0%
um in a division like this
one

02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
where I I'm not sure what these 73
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions are but um I would
 
02:56:43.229 --> 02:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
think that some of them might be
 
02:56:43.239 --> 02:56:44.670 align:start position:0%
think that some of them might be
eligibility

02:56:44.670 --> 02:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
02:56:48.510 --> 02:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
workers and I know that just from my own
 
02:56:52.229 --> 02:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
known experience in working with
 
02:56:55.070 --> 02:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
families they often talk about you know
 
02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
how long it takes for them to um apply
 
02:57:03.429 --> 02:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
get on Ser get a service and I'm
 
02:57:06.590 --> 02:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
wondering what does what happens to the
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh workload and what happens to the the
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
families so I have
 
02:57:18.910 --> 02:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
as you address that would you also talk
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
about new heights I think that's the
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility system and any improvements
 
02:57:27.469 --> 02:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
to productivity we've gotten there yes I
 
02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
have that incorporated into my
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'm going to talk a
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
little bit about that but I will say
 
02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
that um it's
 
02:57:40.229 --> 02:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
concerning as to what the impact of not
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
being able to hire in these positions is
 
02:57:46.750 --> 02:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to have on clients uh and their
 
02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
ability to serve them
 
02:57:54.070 --> 02:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty significant um training
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
for this the the majority of staff are
 
02:58:00.190 --> 02:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
new they're considered to be trainees in
 
02:58:04.229 --> 02:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
field eligibility uh it's like 60 some
 
02:58:07.070 --> 02:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
odd percent of them takes 9 to 12 months
 
02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
to go through training um and there are
 
02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
people who leave because they realize
 
02:58:19.389 --> 02:58:19.399 align:start position:0%
this is not something that I can do um
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
so the more people we have a lot of term
 
02:58:24.510 --> 02:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of turnover uh in this
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
particular area of the division uh so we
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
have a number of different strategies
 
02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
and things that we're trying to
 
02:58:35.110 --> 02:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
accomplish that I'm going to talk about
 
02:58:38.030 --> 02:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but there is still nonetheless uh
 
02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
some significant concerns and challenges
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
going forward to meet the demand and
 
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of people if we can't
 
02:58:48.510 --> 02:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
fill these positions
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah I think that uh the
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
numbers I have are about 69 positions
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
that are in uh field uh the field uh
 
02:59:00.910 --> 02:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
side of the house of BFA right now so so
 
02:59:02.750 --> 02:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
if I take what Mr White said and what
 
02:59:06.830 --> 02:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
you just said is that um the vacant
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
positions that you have get thought
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
about in this more centralized group as
 
02:59:16.710 --> 02:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
the total group takes looks at the
 
02:59:19.469 --> 02:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
priorities overall in the department and
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
that there is at least been some kind of
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
an active decision for these
 
02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies although you it's probably
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
still the case that you would want
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
more yes uh definitely uh so it's pretty
 
02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
much my responsibility to ensure that
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
those who are making the decisions about
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
priorities understand what the impacts
 
02:59:46.349 --> 02:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
are if we were not able to fill certain
 
02:59:46.359 --> 02:59:48.590 align:start position:0%
are if we were not able to fill certain
positions

02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
and and what one of the hopes from two
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
two budget Cycles ago now I'm on my
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
third is that when we talked about New
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
Heights and it sounds like you're about
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
to talk about New Heights anyways but um
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
that as we spent actually a a huge ramp
 
03:00:10.229 --> 03:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
up in it you know three budgets ago from
 
03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
being nearly zeroed out um that the Hope
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
was by investing in in systems like new
 
03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
heights that we would uh gain a
 
03:00:22.190 --> 03:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous productivity enhancement
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
because we'll have a tool in place so
 
03:00:26.830 --> 03:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
that new heights is now you know five
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
years old or so or or at least the
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
biggest revisions could could could you
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
talk about how that system has uh
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
affected the productivity of your
 
03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
affected the productivity of your
eligibility

03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:39.430 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
03:00:39.430 --> 03:00:40.750 align:start position:0%
eligibility
[Music]

03:00:40.750 --> 03:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:00:43.670 --> 03:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
team there have been numerous
 
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
enhancements made to new heights I would
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
like to say probably a majority of them
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on changes or new requirements of
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
our federal Partners or under state law
 
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
um that the funding limits what we are
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
then able to do just to make things
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps more efficient for staff that
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
often is not at the top of the list um
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at changing I'm going
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about business models and the
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing in planning for
 
03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
both the it system and and um business
 
03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
models for the Bureau of family
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
assistance that should uh
 
03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
support greater efficiencies for staff
 
03:01:32.950 --> 03:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
um uh but yes there's certainly always
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
more we need to improve upon because our
 
03:01:38.110 --> 03:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
environment is changing constantly and
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
we need to be leveraging the systems
 
03:01:43.950 --> 03:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
that we have to keep up with that and it
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
takes a long time to be able to
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
implement any kind of
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
develop design and develop first but
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
then Implement changes that are going to
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
be needed so we're we're often I think a
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
little behind in keeping up with demand
 
03:02:01.870 --> 03:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
of the changes that are actually needed
 
03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
um because it does take a long time to
 
03:02:06.930 --> 03:02:06.940 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:14.750 align:start position:0%

03:02:17.550 --> 03:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
those so moving on with the accounting
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
unit under the Bureau of family
 
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
assistance I'm looking at slide 21 uh

there is the accounting unit for
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%

03:02:30.510 --> 03:02:30.520 align:start position:0%

03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:00.990 --> 03:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on that page 868
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
on line
 
03:03:05.710 --> 03:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
074 grants for public assistance and
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
relief there's a significant
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
increase um for 2026 and
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
2027 can you explain what's what was
 
03:03:23.710 --> 03:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh for I'm sorry is there a particular
 
03:03:27.790 --> 03:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
class line you're focusing on yeah
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
074 okay
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
yep employment support I'm sorry
 
03:03:39.790 --> 03:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:43.550 --> 03:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
here so this essentially is uh Workforce
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
Development contracts um we have two
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
vendors that provide services
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for um uh more of the
 
03:03:58.030 --> 03:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
longer term more intense uh activities
 
03:04:00.750 --> 03:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
for people who are in the Employment
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
Program um so what we've added into
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
these contracts is the ability to
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
implement the post tanif support
 
03:04:13.229 --> 03:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
programs that includes the ability to
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
track those
 
03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
individuals okay and and that class line
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
is 100% federal funds okay what about
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
may I continue on the next line uh
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.309 --> 03:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
Services I'm sorry yes you have zero in
 
03:04:38.590 --> 03:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
existing years but then you're up 1.5
 
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
million in each year yep so this is um
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
is an a enhancement or E expansion
 
03:04:51.550 --> 03:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
rather of the snap employment and
 
03:04:54.429 --> 03:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
training program to essentially offer
 
03:04:58.229 --> 03:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
Support Services through uh a new vendor
 
03:05:02.190 --> 03:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh that we would be uh having do case
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
management of their uh
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
employment um uh activities job search
 
03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh resume Development Career building uh
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
or what tuition or what um education
 
03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
they may need credentialing that they
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
may need
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's the increase there
 
03:05:35.790 --> 03:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
you the remaining accounting units under
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of family assistance so we
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
have uh each of those programs um some
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
of them are under a million dollars
 
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not identified in the briefing
 
03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:52.389 align:start position:0%
so it's not identified in the briefing
book

03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
book
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
those def definition of older children
 
03:06:06.190 --> 03:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
for a state separate State Tana program
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh 19 to 20 19 to 26 I believe these are
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
children coming out of uh foster
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
care okay that's really old
 
03:06:18.479 --> 03:06:21.670 align:start position:0%
care okay that's really old
all

03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
right couple years later they'll be on
 
03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:24.740 align:start position:0%
right couple years later they'll be on
Social

03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:24.750 align:start position:0%

03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:26.870 align:start position:0%

03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%

03:06:31.710 --> 03:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
be

03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
um any further questions on those
 
03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
accounting units I'll pause for a bit on
 
03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
accounting units I'll pause for a bit on
page

03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:06:45.229 --> 03:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
22 you'll probably get some questions on
 
03:06:49.469 --> 03:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
Refugee grants tell you know tell us
 
03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
tell tell us how much we're this is all
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
100% Federal do and we don't see any
 
03:06:58.670 --> 03:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
indication that um money to support the
 
03:07:00.670 --> 03:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
refugees that we've already been
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
assigned are going to be
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
pulled I have no indication of that have
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
you heard anything Mr
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
White nothing official I mean similar to
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
the conversation we had earlier I think
 
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of unknowns at this
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
surprised the snap incentive program is
 
03:07:32.750 --> 03:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
under a million dollars what does that
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
do snap incentive program uh I think
 
03:07:35.880 --> 03:07:38.030 align:start position:0%
do snap incentive program uh I think
it's

03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um essentially
 
03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:43.389 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um essentially
to

03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
fund what's known as a double up food
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
bucks program
 
03:07:50.469 --> 03:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
essentially it's to promote the purchase
 
03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
of healthy foods vegetables fruits so
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
that it incentivizes people to make
 
03:07:58.510 --> 03:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
those purchases because it'll give you
 
03:08:01.070 --> 03:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
double the value double the uh your
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
money's worth in those purchases up to
 
03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:18.439 --> 03:08:19.710 align:start position:0%
 
represent

03:08:19.710 --> 03:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:08:23.950 --> 03:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman again as i'
 
03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
have discussed before would it be
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
possible to to get figures of how many
 
03:08:32.030 --> 03:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
people you provide
 
03:08:36.510 --> 03:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
services with all the bureau family
 
03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
assistance and if you have any previous
 
03:08:42.670 --> 03:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
years we would like to see that too if
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's possible how many years would you
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
like well how many year let's say five
 
03:08:49.950 --> 03:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
years okay prior are are we basically
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
asking you to replicate that what's in
 
03:08:56.429 --> 03:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
these um these uh budget briefing books
 
03:08:58.950 --> 03:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of this data the the details
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
previous years are there I I don't know
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I'm asking a question because
 
03:09:04.469 --> 03:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
we haven't consulted the budget briefing
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
book today and I'm just curious if the
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions we're asking on the PowerPoint
 
03:09:10.990 --> 03:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
have been anticipated and put into the
 
03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book so so that that's a
 
03:09:18.269 --> 03:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
question yeah so I'll the history is not
 
03:09:20.830 --> 03:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
included in the briefing book so I think
 
03:09:24.670 --> 03:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
I can simply provide uh some a table of
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the different programs and numbers over
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
a fiveyear period if that would be
 
03:09:43.349 --> 03:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure anything else on those accounting
 
03:09:46.880 --> 03:10:02.190 align:start position:0%
sure anything else on those accounting
units

03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
um slide 23 is specific to employment
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
supports it is Incorporated in the
 
03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance budget but
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
it is its own Bureau and its own
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit uh specifically for that
 
03:10:21.359 --> 03:10:31.790 align:start position:0%
accounting unit uh specifically for that
particular

03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
program what what you've mentioned the
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
that you're developing new outcome
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
measures a couple of times already and
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
then it's in in this bullet again uh
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
what what are you doing how are you
 
03:10:47.710 --> 03:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
doing that what what's your process so
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the metrics for example for
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
tanif um changes of the the requirements
 
03:10:56.750 --> 03:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
for that have been handed down from
 
03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations so it's essentially
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh just working them into the system so
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
that new heights can track that
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
information and then issue Federal
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
required representative
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman on page 86
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
7 line 085 inter agency transfers out of
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
f um can you just give us more
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
explanation about what's happening
 
03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:33.870 align:start position:0%
explanation about what's happening
there

03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
sure okay so the 2024 was
 
03:11:42.030 --> 03:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
31,000 it is adjusted this year for 153
 
03:11:43.870 --> 03:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
and then it jumps up to
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
705 I think I may be on the wrong page
 
03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:49.429 align:start position:0%
705 I think I may be on the wrong page
probably

03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
867 that's why I didn't see
 
03:11:57.790 --> 03:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
it just looking at the split big J yep
 
03:12:05.950 --> 03:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
so this is um transfers uh for funding
 
03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh that supports uh exchanges of
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
information with Employment Security and
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
the State Workforce Innovation board uh
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
it also serves as the uh passed through
 
03:12:20.830 --> 03:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
for federal funding for the community
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
college system that promotes uh the
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
employment and training services for
 
03:12:26.319 --> 03:12:28.670 align:start position:0%
employment and training services for
SNAP

03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
SNAP
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
welcome just a quick question that's UNH
 
03:12:45.190 --> 03:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about there uh it's
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
the community college system oh
 
03:12:52.950 --> 03:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay so I would then uh introduce us to
 
03:13:07.790 --> 03:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
the oh sorry yes I'm sorry um back on
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
page 867 contracts for operational
 
03:13:16.389 --> 03:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
Services I imagine um Zero from the last
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
year and the justed year this year but
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
it jumps up to
 
03:13:24.670 --> 03:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
$3.8 million uh for the next two years
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
can you just give us some reading on
 
03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:28.590 align:start position:0%
can you just give us some reading on
that

03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:32.190 --> 03:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
please so so uh if if you look at class
 
03:13:35.070 --> 03:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh 74 you'll see that that was zeroed
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
out um oh I see okay yeah those funds
 
03:13:42.750 --> 03:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
were moved into into 10 um into
 
03:13:45.309 --> 03:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
103 and and again part of that's done
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
for tracking purposes where when we have
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
100% federally funded contractor
 
03:13:53.309 --> 03:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
agreement we track it in 74 and and
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see those movements throughout
 
03:13:57.389 --> 03:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the years pretty commonly
 
03:14:02.910 --> 03:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.550 --> 03:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
you then I would invite you to join me
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
in reviewing the other half of the
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau of family assistance specifically
 
03:14:20.670 --> 03:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:24.750 --> 03:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.870 --> 03:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
24 so the field operation side of the
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
house this is where uh this is where the
 
03:14:33.790 --> 03:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility determinations are made uh
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
by these particular staff um so the the
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
the bureau here assists of course
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to access
 
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 different medical and
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
economic Assistance programs so that's
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
the service that they're providing
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
basically enabling people to access
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
those Assistance programs they are uh
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
responsible to determine Financial
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility for all of the programs
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
including long-term care applications so
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
we have folks who apply for Medicaid but
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
then also who apply through this uh
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
long-term care unit specifically for um
 
03:15:14.910 --> 03:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
long-term care so Nursing Facility or
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid waiver for um uh choices
 
03:15:22.910 --> 03:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
CFI we provide services to the public
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
through 11 different district offices
 
03:15:32.189 --> 03:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
plus three uh additional units that do
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
not have people come meet with them in
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
person but they do provide Direct
 
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
Services over the phone for folks that
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
includes long-term care uh a number of
 
03:15:46.110 --> 03:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh staff who work on eligibility cases
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh in a State office location and our
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
disability determination
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
unit so a question there you um on the
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration uh are are these the these
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
are the
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
people who take a look at a client's
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
needs and assess their clinical care
 
03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
needs and by assessing their clinical
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
care needs they go into the long-term
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
care setting with some sort of Acuity
 
03:16:22.110 --> 03:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
rating of some kind and and and the
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
amount of money that gets reimbursed is
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
dependent upon that Acuity rating is is
 
03:16:31.189 --> 03:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
that what these folks do no I I would
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
say that's likely more through our
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations that
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
determine level and types of care this
 
03:16:42.189 --> 03:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
is essentially to be determined eligible
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
financially and eligible medically for
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
long-term care services what the
 
03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
services are moves to a different area
 
03:16:54.030 --> 03:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid so so I don't I don't
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that our mcos do long-term care
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
they they don't they don't get into the
 
03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
U the evaluation of the care but but the
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
bottom line is you're not doing
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the level of care needed
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
for these folks you're doing simply the
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
financial assessment correct which is
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
probably why I didn't answer that
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
correctly no no no that's fine the
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm just coming up to speed on
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
how we do uh the the care assessments
 
03:17:25.389 --> 03:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
and there's been some discussion about
 
03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
moving that to uh to the
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
counties that would not affect your
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
department other than you would still
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
probably be involved in the financial
 
03:17:37.710 --> 03:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
assessment we're engaging with uh at
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
least one particular County to look at a
 
03:17:44.590 --> 03:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
Pilot so that the county could assist in
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility Financial
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
for long-term care
 
03:17:53.550 --> 03:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
services um the the hope is that it
 
03:17:57.070 --> 03:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
would perhaps uh build capacity for the
 
03:18:00.910 --> 03:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
ability to process those uh effectively
 
03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
and And Timely I I think Miss Santella
 
03:18:06.030 --> 03:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
wants to make me smarter what what what
 
03:18:07.950 --> 03:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
are you going to say sure um you will
 
03:18:10.630 --> 03:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
hear about um the medical eligibility
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's done under the division of
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services when
 
03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa hard's here next week okay and
 
03:18:18.750 --> 03:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
and so miss Hebert's group and that
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
group collaborates to create essentially
 
03:18:24.030 --> 03:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
a client profile of Financial and
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
medical needs correct is that is that
 
03:18:29.309 --> 03:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
sort of profile building is that done in
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Heights or how is how is that sort
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
of integrated view of the client where
 
03:18:36.510 --> 03:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
where's that house New Heights that's in
 
03:18:40.950 --> 03:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
New Heights yes Adam said so and and in
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
what Adam said so oh okay so he's right
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure and and then is New Heights A
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
system that our mcos also
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
touch not for that eligibility no do our
 
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.070 --> 03:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
heights there's different levels of
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
access and Adam is going to talk about
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
that because he is New Heights and is
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
New Heights a software only server or
 
03:19:18.510 --> 03:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
Services of
 
03:19:20.670 --> 03:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
software uh Adam lcan I'm the project
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
manager for New Heights uh so so I think
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
the first question was the counties we
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
have as Karen said the the pilot for
 
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
Mart County to be able to have access to
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
and and sure and assist uh uh on the
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
financial side um I don't believe that
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
has kicked off just yet no uh and for
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
was second question software as a
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
service well I wanted to know if the
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
mcos use New Heights and and Miss
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
Santella just said no not for long-term
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
care no they they do they they have
 
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
access to new I'm sorry to interrup no
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
no no so you're about to answer the rest
 
03:20:01.150 --> 03:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
so the mcos do have access to uh New
 
03:20:03.309 --> 03:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
Heights very minimal uh uh information
 
03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
we share with them it's really just that
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh they're able to go in and look at
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
individuals that are eligible with them
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
yeah and they can see their information
 
03:20:13.189 --> 03:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
their Medicaid information in in Heights
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have any update
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
access to the system and and so is that
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
application offered as software as a
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
service is that a a cloud-based uh no
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
everything is on Prem we we own it the
 
03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
state uh it's it's um uh at Hazen drive
 
03:20:32.510 --> 03:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
and you install fat clients thin clients
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh web web clients it's all kind
 
03:20:37.870 --> 03:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
of Thin Client is the old term and I'm
 
03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
old so okay that that that helps because
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's a there's another discussion
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
happening in background on what we
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
should do with long-term service support
 
03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
whether we should be talking about
 
03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
migrating that to the mcos and what that
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
would do and so I just want to know how
 
03:20:59.550 --> 03:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
this financial eligibility would have to
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
go along with that so thank thank you
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
problem so this is an area of the
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
division so the Bureau of family
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
assistance uh in field operations that
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
is experiencing many challenges to
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
providing quality services to people
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
including meeting time frames and
 
03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
reaching high performance um so I would
 
03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to the outcomes that
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
really is all about the volume of work
 
03:21:36.189 --> 03:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
that these folks are doing and at a 23%
 
03:21:38.710 --> 03:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate among these
 
03:21:41.110 --> 03:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
staff so we're challenged to conduct
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
these activities but as monthly these uh
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
folks are processing over 8,000
 
03:21:49.550 --> 03:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
on average new
 
03:21:53.550 --> 03:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
applications they are making over 13,000
 
03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
redeterminations or renewals of
 
03:21:59.630 --> 03:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
Eligibility uh for people
 
03:22:03.790 --> 03:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
monthly we receive about 29,000 phone
 
03:22:08.790 --> 03:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
calls uh uh monthly uh inbound calls uh
 
03:22:10.349 --> 03:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
that's not even the total amount it's
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
only the amount we record from our tier
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:19.150 --> 03:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
center staff are processing over 91,000
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
documents a
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
month and making over 26,000 updates to
 
03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
cases every month so the the volume is
 
03:22:32.670 --> 03:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and challenged by the fact
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
that we have such a high vacancy rate in
 
03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
this particular uh area so while we're
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
trying to provide services to about
 
03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:43.990 align:start position:0%
trying to provide services to about
200,000

03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
200,000
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
people so so this is all great good data
 
03:22:51.550 --> 03:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
I but but I like context and so one one
 
03:22:53.950 --> 03:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
point of context is that's a tremendous
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
amount of work the way you you presented
 
03:23:00.750 --> 03:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
it and emphasized it but but do you have
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh Manpower benchmarks to say you know a
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
person should only do 500 new applicants
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
a year or or each person should only do
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
a th do you have do you have sort of a
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
Manpower metric to be able to apply
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
consistent ly to the workload we're
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with we're trying to look uh
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
through a particular uh internal
 
03:23:25.950 --> 03:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee at uh case loads and workloads
 
03:23:29.550 --> 03:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
right now um so it it's been very
 
03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to try to identify what are
 
03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
difficult to try to identify what are
those

03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:23:36.429 --> 03:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
benchmarks right so the answer is no I
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that but right now you can
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
calculate because you have actual work
 
03:23:45.070 --> 03:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
and you have actual numbers of people
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
you can calculate the
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
current workload benchmarks because it
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
just is the numbers that you're dealing
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
with from there it would just
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
secondarily be what should the Benchmark
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
be if it should be below what you're
 
03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing so sure and and I
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
think it changes though perhaps every
 
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
day because we have people that leave we
 
03:24:10.189 --> 03:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
have people that are new trainees that
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
are not able to take on the full
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
workload that a seasoned uh eligibility
 
03:24:20.070 --> 03:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
worker can take on uh they start off
 
03:24:22.830 --> 03:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
slow they start off small and then build
 
03:24:24.510 --> 03:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
from there once they reach certain
 
03:24:26.790 --> 03:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
competencies yeah so it's difficult to
 
03:24:31.469 --> 03:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
measure this um I get it thanks sure uh
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative priest did you have a
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
question yes I did and thank you for
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledging um and thank you for
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question again back on the
 
03:24:45.429 --> 03:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
outcomes and results monthly was this a
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
particular month
 
03:24:49.070 --> 03:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
or was this an average of all of the
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
months in 24 it's an average over the
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so you uh spoke earlier
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
about it taking I think it was up to
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
nine months to train a person to for one
 
03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
of these
 
03:25:14.830 --> 03:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
positions are they required to
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand the eligib ility for each of
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
these programs both the state
 
03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility and the federal
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
eligibilities it's eligibility yes for
 
03:25:27.870 --> 03:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
all programs but it's also policy it's
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
procedures which are very detailed
 
03:25:33.030 --> 03:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of well if it's this facts
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
set of facts then you do this if it's
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
that set of facts then you do that so
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's very um tedious it's a lot to learn
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
and understand and remember so we have a
 
03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
a training unit to try to keep up with
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
the need which has been challenging as
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
well to do that um so that's where I
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
think some of the system changes and
 
03:25:58.830 --> 03:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
plans that we're making may come into
 
03:26:01.710 --> 03:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
place to assist with that so when you
 
03:26:05.110 --> 03:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
hire a new person do
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
they go for training or do they start do
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
they actually is it sort of on the job
 
03:26:14.830 --> 03:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
training so there's some preliminary
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
information but uh until they are uh
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
able to hit a a certain competency um
 
03:26:26.189 --> 03:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to uh be on their
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
own so to speak okay thank you
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
sure do does do your processes support
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a a
 
03:26:37.630 --> 03:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
competency developed or
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
regulated um um uh
 
03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
workflow capability like like if you got
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
a 100 cases you got 15 of them that are
 
03:26:51.070 --> 03:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
really hard and 20 of them that are kind
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
of easy does your does your it does your
 
03:26:57.790 --> 03:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
workflow manager basically allow the
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
development of of a of a workflow so
 
03:27:04.670 --> 03:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
that you can have the appropriately um
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
ready competency dealing with that work
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so the workload management is is they
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
they utilize a daily dashboard in a
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
sense it basically directs them on the
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
different tasks and things that they
 
03:27:22.189 --> 03:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
need to accomplish next uh for any given
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
number of cases for any number of cases
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
not per client but correct okay and then
 
03:27:29.790 --> 03:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
that that their clients the set of their
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
clients is based on like a degree of
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty is is your workflow manager
 
03:27:39.070 --> 03:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
that good so or does everyone get the
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:48.910 --> 03:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'll have to have my expert in that
 
03:27:50.990 --> 03:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
answer this is where the productivity
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
really comes in you know is the extent
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
to which the workflow management of
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
these it systems are adaptable so that
 
03:28:01.110 --> 03:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
you can you can hit the work that
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're able to do and then elevated it
 
03:28:06.429 --> 03:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
as they get better so so what can you
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
tell us about this um I'm Carrie schroer
 
03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau chief for BFA field Ops
 
03:28:14.469 --> 03:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
um so our trainees uh learn programs at
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
a time so they case load reflects that
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
so for example if somebody is brand new
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
coming in they'll learn all of the
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
policy and procedures for SNAP for
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
example once they um have a handle on
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
that then we add additional programs to
 
03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
it in their case load they'll have a
 
03:28:32.590 --> 03:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
mixed bag if you will so there will be
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
some that are you know straightforward
 
03:28:36.630 --> 03:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
applications and some of them that
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
are more difficult I guess um and it's
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
really just to see what their competency
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
level is as they get added to and if
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
they don't um
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
continually progress then we go back and
 
03:28:50.110 --> 03:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
then make sure that they're getting that
 
03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
as they
 
03:28:55.469 --> 03:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
go that's reassuring thank you yep so
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative tki and then
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative ala quick question when
 
03:29:01.469 --> 03:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
we talk about eligibility I know that
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
children who are in households with TANF
 
03:29:08.670 --> 03:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
or snap are um automatically eligible
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch meals and I'm
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
just curious how that communication
 
03:29:18.269 --> 03:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's just through an
 
03:29:23.950 --> 03:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
interface with the Department of
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
Education okay okay yes I was right okay
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's an electronic interface with them
 
03:29:35.349 --> 03:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
too does it go the other way could the
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
communication go the other way
 
03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:43.469 align:start position:0%
communication go the other way
too

03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:50.590 --> 03:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:52.510 --> 03:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chairman I I
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
think this is a a question that builds
 
03:29:57.630 --> 03:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
on what uh representative Edwards was
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
asking and when I look at that list of
 
03:30:02.790 --> 03:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
outcome and results uh and and listening
 
03:30:06.309 --> 03:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
to what uh was said here I'm I'm
 
03:30:08.950 --> 03:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
assuming that some of the staff are
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
handling um you know all of something in
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
all of these categories some maybe um uh
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
for example on the redeterminations
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's a a higher higher level of of
 
03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
training and staff may be dedicated to
 
03:30:26.189 --> 03:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
that is that is that a correct
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
characterization in terms of workflow so
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
and and then finally the case
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
updates sorry documents scanned and
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
indexed everybody must be doing that
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
right yes so uh we have a a unit that
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
specifically uh is responsible for the
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
documents that have been scanned
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
or uploaded from uh our self-service
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
portal and then index them so in other
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
words attach them um uh virtually
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to a particular case but then
 
03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
the eligibility staff have to then take
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
each of those documents which they're
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
just images now of the documents and
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
then process them so depending on what
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the document is Will dictate what needs
 
03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
to be processed and how
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
um and I forget the first part of your
 
03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
um and I forget the first part of your
question

03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
sorry um um I I think that answers the
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
the question so it's a it's a
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
combination of uh and attributable to
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
the level of training that's required in
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
order to to do some of these tasks some
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
of them are relatively mechanical tasks
 
03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
yes uh some of them require some
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
judgmental uh determination according to
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the rules and the specific
 
03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
program is so we have what what staff
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
that can that perform the eligibility
 
03:31:52.030 --> 03:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are referred to as
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
generalists they essentially have to
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
know everything about everything uh
 
03:32:00.510 --> 03:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
although the unit that manages long-term
 
03:32:00.520 --> 03:32:01.950 align:start position:0%
although the unit that manages long-term
care

03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:32:05.469 --> 03:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
applications that is uh quite a bit more
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
involved there's a significant amount of
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
manual work that has to be done with
 
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing long-term applications that
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
includes a 3 to 5e look back of
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds or if not thousands of pages of
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
documents uh to help determine whether
 
03:32:24.389 --> 03:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
or not the individual is financially
 
03:32:27.150 --> 03:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for long-term care there's a
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
lot of manual workarounds uh with our it
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
system right now for long-term care
 
03:32:33.630 --> 03:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
which is in our plans to make
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
improvements but it it's tedious uh it
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
it requires a lot of very focused time
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
in reviewing each of those
 
03:32:46.910 --> 03:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
documents thank you representative
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um back on
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the outcomes and results um the monthly
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
average for
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
2024 um do you have figures of the
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
previous five years to see if if these
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
averages are going up or down or staying
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
the same uh for your workload so there
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
may be uh nuances or variables involved
 
03:33:18.030 --> 03:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
in looking at p last years for example
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
um uh the inbound calls uh we've had uh
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh looking at different um metrics with
 
03:33:28.189 --> 03:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of different vendors that have
 
03:33:29.790 --> 03:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
been involved in our tier one call
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
center so there may be some Nuance
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
differences there um case updates
 
03:33:38.910 --> 03:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
because cases change all the time
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
policies change all the time which means
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
procedures for staff change all the time
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh so they're could be some differences
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
there that are tough to uh to to compare
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
to past
 
03:33:55.670 --> 03:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
years I could certainly give you um
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
something that might be relatively
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
comparable would be previous year that
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be great and and have you in the
 
03:34:06.670 --> 03:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
past had the same kind of vacancy rate
 
03:34:06.680 --> 03:34:07.710 align:start position:0%
past had the same kind of vacancy rate
of

03:34:07.710 --> 03:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
23% or is that just being increased
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
because of the uh the market pressures
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
so we've had had a about a 20 to 23%
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in this Bureau for several
 
03:34:21.239 --> 03:34:22.750 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in this Bureau for several
years

03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
you okay this this isn't your issue but
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
um I've got a doctor's appointment uh
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
coming up I have about 25 more minutes
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
before I have to leave you guys can
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
continue but if we if uh if we
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
could try to do it in that time sure if
 
03:34:44.429 --> 03:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
you want to go to slide 25 that
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
essentially gives you some
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
um history over the last year of each
 
03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
month for the the tier one call center
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is an external uh contracted vendor
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
call center that basically answers calls
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
into a central location for the Bureau
 
03:35:04.269 --> 03:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
of family assistance um this is a
 
03:35:08.309 --> 03:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and it is a significant
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
prioritized need um I wanted to show you
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
that the um uh with a cost Center a tier
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
one call center we have two tiers
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
essentially tier 2 is made up of uh BFA
 
03:35:25.189 --> 03:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
internal staff who are more experts to
 
03:35:28.030 --> 03:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
handle complex questions or uh
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
information but the tier one answers a
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
lot of general
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions right now they have a 2.7
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
abandonment rate which is pretty good um
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
and a 17 minute average weit time which
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
seems like a long time but I will tell
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
you that without the call center we have
 
03:35:49.590 --> 03:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
had about a 2 to three hour wait time I
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't like waiting for you know 10
 
03:35:54.269 --> 03:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
seconds on the call never mind on that
 
03:35:57.870 --> 03:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
so so you say this is a prioritized need
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
M Mr W were you present when this was
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
discussed with the governor's office
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
this I I I I would have to go back and
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
and talk to them um relative to their
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
conclusion but I don't I don't believe
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
we had too extensive conversations
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
relative this how how much more money is
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
in the prioritized need request sure so
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
turn to uh slide
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
presentation you will see uh the
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility call center on the first
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
line there it's 1.8 million General
 
03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.309 --> 03:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
yikes are these prioritized needs on the
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
back these five of them are they rank
 
03:36:50.910 --> 03:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
ordered is this is this meant to be your
 
03:36:52.990 --> 03:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
increment list of what you would do
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
um no I well I didn't rank them in that
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
sense okay we're going to need a ranking
 
03:37:06.429 --> 03:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do anything with that
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
list so and then we're going to probably
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
need to know what sort of a minimum
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
essential opening bid might look like or
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
whether you know like for example
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility call center 1.8 in general
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
in the first year I mean all right so so
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
what what what what would 700,000 buy
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
you I I I I I need I need to know if
 
03:37:31.189 --> 03:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
these are all or nothing or if there's
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
some sort of range in here sure I I I
 
03:37:39.070 --> 03:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
think part of it would be dependent upon
 
03:37:41.229 --> 03:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
what funds were available because we
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
would we would need to go out to um to
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
bid for them
 
03:37:48.189 --> 03:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and if there was a fixed amount of
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
money then we would probably need to
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
disclose that in in the RFP or the
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the method that we'd want
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
to utilize to see what was a level of
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
service that we could get but Karen I
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to speak to what
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
amounts so essentially this would give
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
us um uh a call center that would be
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
able to keep up with a required capacity
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
of inbound calls so that would include
 
03:38:22.469 --> 03:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
not just the uh General phone number but
 
03:38:24.670 --> 03:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
we would want them to be able to manage
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
inbound calls for long-term care and
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
other areas of the of the bureau so it
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
essentially would cover um training uh a
 
03:38:37.359 --> 03:38:38.389 align:start position:0%
essentially would cover um training uh a
a

03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
a uh a number of the uh customer service
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives um like perhaps about 35
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
to 40 Representatives answering the
 
03:38:51.790 --> 03:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
calls and that they would also be able
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
to perform certain administrative
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
services for us where we may need them
 
03:38:59.110 --> 03:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
such as Outreach activities uh that we
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh that just gives you I think a general
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
may may maybe we could set up a just a
 
03:39:20.990 --> 03:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
office visit to talk about these
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs I I think I I just
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
need more Nuance in the in the detail
 
03:39:29.469 --> 03:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think we're ready to do
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
that today and I because I don't even
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
have my questions but but um I I think
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
some of these seem as I'm looking at 36
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
some of them appear as though they have
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
a business case behind them and I kind
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
of want understand the business case and
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
that may take more time than we have
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
here today so um I I I'm fairly
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
available I can come over sometime to
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
Brown to go through
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
this that's my offer definitely
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative priest do you have a
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
question or do you I do have a I do have
 
03:40:09.309 --> 03:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
a question thank you too acknowledging
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
um um I'm on also on page uh 36 and and
 
03:40:15.389 --> 03:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
in some of the lines like the
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility call center it just doesn't
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
add up so could someone go back and take
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
a look at that and also um in the same
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
vein as uh chairman Edwards I would like
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
to know if you have
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
any um cost efficiencies of these
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
priorities if for for instance if we
 
03:40:41.950 --> 03:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
were able to fund some of these would
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
there be cost savings down the road and
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
how much would they be for the
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
Department that that's exactly what I
 
03:40:52.990 --> 03:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
meant when I said these feel like they
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
have business cases that could be put
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
behind we need to yeah I I I would like
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
to see um the cost efficiencies um given
 
03:41:03.309 --> 03:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's so much demand for so little
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
money that we have to work with so that
 
03:41:12.750 --> 03:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
would be great and also if you can just
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at the total on on some of
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
those lines uh I would appreciate it too
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah the the the totals are
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
are incorrect for the eligibility call
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
center um I I think one thing to
 
03:41:28.189 --> 03:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
consider is sometimes when we put
 
03:41:29.550 --> 03:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
together prioritized needs we're not
 
03:41:32.110 --> 03:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
only thinking about cost efficiencies
 
03:41:35.309 --> 03:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
we're also thinking about cost aversion
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
so so the snap error reduction rate that
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's an example of where if we were to
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
be able to improve our systems we would
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
lower the likelihood of of future
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
potential Federal
 
03:41:50.429 --> 03:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
penalties so that's a business case that
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a business case right you know um
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a riskmanagement approach
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
chairman hopefully this is
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
simple um when I look at for example the
 
03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility call center there's a
 
03:42:08.149 --> 03:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
general Federal split is that Federal
 
03:42:10.830 --> 03:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
money we're currently ineligible for
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
that if we spent the 1.8 million we
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:22.630 --> 03:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
get uh so it it's essentially uh a
 
03:42:26.910 --> 03:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
federal match to the general funds um
 
03:42:29.550 --> 03:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
based on the percentages of the
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
program am I saying that right
 
03:42:35.229 --> 03:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
okay and I guess just to make sure I'm
 
03:42:37.950 --> 03:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
not misunderstanding it's
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
not it's Federal money in addition to
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
everything else that's already in the
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
budget not taking from some other areas
 
03:42:45.239 --> 03:42:47.070 align:start position:0%
budget not taking from some other areas
correct

03:42:47.070 --> 03:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
correct so so represented tki you just
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
heard me invite myself to like an office
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
call to go into some more detail on
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
these business cases if if um your party
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
wants to send somebody with me so we
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
could just brainstorm it
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
together pardon me on the prioritized
 
03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
needs on page 36 yes yes ma'am yeah I'd
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
like someone involv with that yeah no
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll uh I'll I'll keep you in the
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
loop as we develop a a potential
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
schedule because I I think I think that
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know three or four of us uh not from
 
03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
the committee but someone from your
 
03:43:25.830 --> 03:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
party my party and then the department
 
03:43:32.189 --> 03:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
conversation all right what what what
 
03:43:37.630 --> 03:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
can you do in 10
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
minutes I these next two slides 26 and
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
27 fascinate me well then let's go there
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
so these two slides are essentially
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
about New Heights uh the uh integrated
 
03:43:55.590 --> 03:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility and enrollment system which
 
03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
is no longer about just eligibility
 
03:44:00.110 --> 03:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
Heights is actually an acronym uh which
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
stands for helping Empower individuals
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
get help
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
transitioning uh to
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency uh so this uh the the
 
03:44:12.910 --> 03:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh New Heights team essentially uh I
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
like to refer to as the central nervous
 
03:44:18.269 --> 03:44:18.279 align:start position:0%
system of uh of the division uh which is
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
now really expanding into other
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
divisions as well including Medicaid and
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services so we
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
want to continue uh adopting and
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
leveraging technology that is available
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
to us uh to just continuous Improvement
 
03:44:38.429 --> 03:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
continuously creating more efficiencies
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
so that access is easier and that staff
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
have an easier time processing uh so
 
03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
as you can see on the uh boxes to the
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
right this is my right um the number of
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
households that are in open cases right
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
now uh is over
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
133,000 there are a number of folks that
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
are that have given us permission to use
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
text and email for communicating with
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
them which certainly creates
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
efficiencies there are
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
133,000 active New Hampshire easy
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
accounts New Hampshire easy is the
 
03:45:14.429 --> 03:45:14.439 align:start position:0%
web-based self-service portal that is
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
connected with the in uh the eligibility
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
system uh easy is an acronym it stands
 
03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
for the electronic application system
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially what it is people
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
can apply online through it they can
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
create an account they can upload
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
documents to it they can communicate
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
with us through it um they can see the
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
status of their application and benefits
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of a lot of information
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's also used by uh a number of
 
03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrolled providers to be able
 
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
to look at the status of certain
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
applications like for nursing facility
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
long-term care uh so that they can help
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
us help the client or their patient uh
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
in order to get uh a determination of
 
03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
Eligibility as quickly as possible uh so
 
03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
they're able to look at uh the accounts
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
with certain authorization from the
 
03:46:08.429 --> 03:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
client to be able to to help with that
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh there are number of projects uh that
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
we've conducted in 24 and even more in
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
26 and I'd like to talk about those
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
um essentially serving 1100 Department
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
users uh and about a million
 
03:46:25.229 --> 03:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.630 --> 03:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
day there are a number of priority
 
03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
projects that we're looking at including
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
some uh strategies that would reduce the
 
03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
snap error rate which we were just
 
03:46:34.199 --> 03:46:35.389 align:start position:0%
snap error rate which we were just
talking

03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
about uh there are a number of projects
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to implement that would
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
actually enhance the user experience for
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire easy
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh to make it
 
03:46:49.830 --> 03:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
easier uh there are a number of
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
operational efficiencies that we want to
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
be able to implement which I can talk
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
about uh as well what those priorities
 
03:47:02.149 --> 03:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
are on the second slide uh slide
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
27 this is more specifically narrowed
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
down to the uh work that is uh being
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
built in new uh New Heights specifically
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
to support long-term supports and
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
services so we've added a number of
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
users to uh the system for that uh which
 
03:47:22.149 --> 03:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
includes it support for uh case
 
03:47:24.750 --> 03:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
management uh and services for the uh
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence Medicaid waiver
 
03:47:30.750 --> 03:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh the um developmentally dis disabled
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
population uh acquired brain disorder uh
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
those waiver management uh uh activities
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's uh functionality in here now
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
that supports Adult Protective Services
 
03:47:46.590 --> 03:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh and uh there number of additional
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
users and um are are these five bullets
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive or or if you do like
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
one set of it upgrade you get all of
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
them in the same upgrade
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
packet are these distinct these These
 
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
are distinct separate functions of the
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
system now that
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
support thank you long-term support so
 
03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
you have prioritizations within those
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
so and I wanted to touch on um so those
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
are you'll see the in the box there the
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh higher priority projects uh for the
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
the system that supports for example the
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
system of care uh for healthy aging uh
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
and a number of Medicaid projects a
 
03:48:36.030 --> 03:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
number of them uh and some other
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
projects so this is also designed to
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
help support area agencies and other
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
stakeholders nursing facilities um
 
03:48:52.750 --> 03:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
helping those clients those patients um
 
03:48:54.189 --> 03:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
helping us to help
 
03:48:56.910 --> 03:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
them so I'm just going to give you a
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
germ of a thought if if if if if this
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
conversation continues around migrating
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
long-term service support to
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
mcos that that that may have
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
implications for how you prioritize
 
03:49:14.149 --> 03:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
these particular projects um you know
 
03:49:16.030 --> 03:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
maybe hold hold off on the long-term
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
care a little
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
longer um I I I I don't know I don't I
 
03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with that but I
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know that there has
 
03:49:28.030 --> 03:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
been discussion about sure and I think
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
that uh Dr Hardy can provide you with
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more detail and information
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
specific to uh the long-term care
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
supports and services work and how that
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
is being impacted with what uh changes
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're making for them in New Heights
 
03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:45.790 align:start position:0%
we're making for them in New Heights
okay

03:49:45.790 --> 03:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's critical in these last few slides
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to give the public an
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity if anyone so I do want to
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
talk about just for uh briefly if I can
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
the priority areas that we're looking at
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
specifically for BFA or the Bureau of
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
family assistance uh and uh the business
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
models that we're currently using we're
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
really identifying the impact of
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
operations here by looking at process
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
people and systems there are significant
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
number of Demands there are a lot of
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
challenges in this Bureau to meet them
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
so how can we leverage uh changing
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain models of how we do business so
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
for example changing from a case based
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
model processing model to a task based
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
processing model so I'll talk about that
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly but we're basically just
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing where the challenges are in
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
the each of these processes sure so I
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
like this slide a lot uh I can relate to
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
this uh I see the source is deoe
 
03:50:46.750 --> 03:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh is is
 
03:50:51.550 --> 03:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
a uh are are are the de deoe people
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
essential to this effort yes they're
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
essentially conducting uh quite an
 
03:51:02.429 --> 03:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
analysis uh for us um in order to help
 
03:51:05.229 --> 03:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
us determine what changes we may want to
 
03:51:09.070 --> 03:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
pursue are are you all able to hire one
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
or two or three really great people in
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
the department and and do with less Deo
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
service deo's pretty expensive well um
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're great quality yeah and and this
 
03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
is work that Deo has been partnering
 
03:51:29.309 --> 03:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
with us on um to try to look towards the
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
future of what it is that we may be able
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
to do whether it's low hanging fruit uh
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
low or no cost items that we would CH
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
look towards changing or more complex or
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
higher cost items that we would look
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
towards changing so this is a very early
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
stage of looking at uh a comparison of
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing yeah uh and
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
seeing where they are successful and
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
what's not working in other particular
 
03:51:55.950 --> 03:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
States so they're bringing us all of
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
this information so this started this
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
slide is July 24 so we've got eight
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
months a run rate already with
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
deoe okay and you're starting to feel
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
like you're already seeing results well
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
we are seeing basically uh identifying
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
what it is that we could prioritize as
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
far as changing
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
based on funding that we may have uh and
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
the complexity what is the level of
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
effort needed for any of the things that
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
are are recommended so we've we've uh
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
quite a list from them uh that we are
 
03:52:30.750 --> 03:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
trying to prioritize right now um but
 
03:52:32.349 --> 03:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
because we're so chronically underst
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
staffed um and have identified uh you
 
03:52:38.349 --> 03:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
know really where it is that we want to
 
03:52:40.469 --> 03:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh where it is we need to make some
 
03:52:42.269 --> 03:52:42.279 align:start position:0%
particular changes that would help
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
reduce our vacancy rate and help make
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
training easier uh But it includes
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
further autom automation uh to align
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
with that business model yeah um and I
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
know that you heard from Mr weers a bit
 
03:52:59.070 --> 03:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
about uh implementing AI in some
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
instances and this is an area that we're
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
looking at for that specifically limited
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
to policies looking at real-time
 
03:53:08.910 --> 03:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
information for staff so I feel like uh
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm jamming you on time here as you're
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
reaching the conclusion and so like
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
earlier when we said that we would try
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
to find another division 3 work session
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
to bring your slide back on the item
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
four of the tanif if if you go home and
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
think about this and you go oh darn I
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
need another 15 minutes you know let's
 
03:53:31.870 --> 03:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's put those two things
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
together and Tack it onto another
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
division three sure so so I can you can
 
03:53:40.269 --> 03:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
you conclude I before you conclude
 
03:53:42.429 --> 03:53:42.439 align:start position:0%
though is there anyone in the audience
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
who thinks they want to testify or say
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
something on this
 
03:53:49.630 --> 03:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
subject so there are a couple of people
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
so um can you are you able to kind of
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
conclude with where we're at knowing
 
03:53:58.030 --> 03:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
that that you can come back and nail The
 
03:54:00.510 --> 03:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
Landing later well I I think that if
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
there are questions specifically to the
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
accounting units in this particular area
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
we would want time to be able to look at
 
03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
that um but I I wanted to lay a bit of a
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
foundation so that you have an
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
understanding as to here are the
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
challenges this is what we're currently
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
doing about them and this is what I
 
03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
would like your help with in the
 
03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
future I think that prioritize needless
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
is fascinating and we just need to talk
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
about it and see if we've got a business
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
case that justifies the taxpayers
 
03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
investment in the next budget because
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
cash is tight so so I I I'm I'm I I'm
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
I'm in a learning mode with you
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
excellent um Mr W do you have anything
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
you want to wrap up on here no not at
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
this point thank you though okay any uh
 
03:54:49.830 --> 03:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
members have final questions before we
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
call the audience Mr representative
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you this is a question for
 
03:54:56.830 --> 03:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
Mr White uh throughout the
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
presentations uh I think every every
 
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
member on the committee has asked at one
 
03:55:03.550 --> 03:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
time or another about the numbers on you
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
might go from zero to $3 million and
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job in
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
explaining where where it comes from um
 
03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we I'd probably be here
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
another 3 hours if I I wrote down
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
everything that you said so as I go
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
through the budget what is the best way
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
for me when I see a figure that I don't
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
understand uh to be able to understand
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I know you had talked at one time
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
about not giving a whole uh whole budget
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
um listing of of the transfers um but I
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
also feel that it may not be the best
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
way to present you with 50 questions a
 
03:55:47.189 --> 03:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
day sure um I I I I I agree I mean I
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
think the budget is a very difficult
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
opaque document um because it doesn't
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
say exactly what it means um I would
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
recommend if there's specific areas to
 
03:55:57.790 --> 03:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
initially go through the LBA and and
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
start there and if if Kevin doesn't have
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
the answer I can I can work with Kevin
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh to get the correct answer for you and
 
03:56:05.710 --> 03:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
we are working on those um those
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
crosswalks from uh the DCF presentation
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed and we should have
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham welcome you
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
want to start at the top and go back
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
through or yeah can we can you just
 
03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
repeat everything no thank you very much
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I I did have a I I was able to uh
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
review most participate in most of this
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
remotely um a question I had coming back
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
to the tanif question um was uh first of
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
all I wanted you to verify that the
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
spending for the this bium is adequate
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
to um uh maintain the tanif um funding
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
at the same level going forward and then
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
following up on that it sounded like you
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
have concerns uh that um that uh some of
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
the staff reductions is going to leave a
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
short intan of spending and that you're
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I understood
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
properly that you're going to come back
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
to us uh uh during the budget process uh
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
with a with the tanif fully funded to
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
maintain uh the funding for uh the next
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
bium cycle and then I have one followup
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
question could could I ask you to
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that are I I heard two things in
 
03:57:21.149 --> 03:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
there I think I think you want to
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
validate that we're on track to finish
 
03:57:25.229 --> 03:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
this existing budget with the
 
03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate match right and you're also
 
03:57:32.189 --> 03:57:32.199 align:start position:0%
asking going forward what the risks are
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
associated with meeting in the next
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
budgets match that's exactly correct Mr
 
03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
chair all right thank you sure so um I I
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
can't yet say for the current state
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um we are working uh the on
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
on the analysis so I've talked about the
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
budget system that we implemented um a
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years back that now allows us
 
03:57:55.950 --> 03:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
in in real time to quickly be able to
 
03:57:58.510 --> 03:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
determine that so that analysis is
 
03:58:00.510 --> 03:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing probably need at least another
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
week and what the discussion that
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
occurred um earlier repres
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham while you were
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
not here was um relative to the
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
reduction of the 394 unfunded positions
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
and whether we'd be able to meet for
 
03:58:17.429 --> 03:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
State fiscal years 26 and 27 um we're
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that same analysis
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
similar obviously for the future uh not
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
actual expense um but we're hoping here
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
in probably a week or two to have
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
something for the committee just so that
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
we can alert you of any concerns that
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
we've been able to identify so far okay
 
03:58:33.990 --> 03:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I guess the other question
 
03:58:36.189 --> 03:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
I had is just you know are you seeing
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
signs that these unfunded
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
positions now you know currently
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
unfilled soon to be unfunded I guess
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
current budget unfunded positions are
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
making it difficult for you to keep up
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh with things like this kind of
 
03:58:52.830 --> 03:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
calculations or compliance uh
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
requirements compliance reports uh and
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
you know things like you know accounting
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
or or whether uh whether you're seeing a
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
lot of stress and your side from that
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sure I I I think um again
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
there there's sort of two factors that
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
play number one is the state uh is under
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
a hiring freeze with the exception of
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
direct care positions and there's a
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
waiver process for the other positions
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of one side of the coin
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of that will naturally
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
slow down um hiring and then the other
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
side is um you know we anticipate that
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
the you know $26 million of General
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
funds or so um of unfunded positions
 
03:59:34.990 --> 03:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
will have an impact in the future and
 
03:59:37.269 --> 03:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
typically what you will see as a result
 
03:59:40.429 --> 03:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
of of these things is slowly over time
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
your your vacancy rate will increase
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
because you won't necessarily have the
 
03:59:46.269 --> 03:59:46.279 align:start position:0%
ility initially you won't see a lot but
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of the slow cycle where
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
you can't maximize posting all your
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
positions at once cuz you you don't have
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
them funded um so you know we we we
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
would probably see the long-term effects
 
04:00:01.070 --> 04:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
6 Months 8 months a year plus out in the
 
04:00:04.030 --> 04:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
next bium where we would start to see uh
 
04:00:06.030 --> 04:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
any any potential negative consequences
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
of that but I think at this point in
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
time it's still relatively
 
04:00:12.429 --> 04:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
early okay well something that we may
 
04:00:14.429 --> 04:00:14.439 align:start position:0%
talk about in future is just you know
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to understand the consequences of
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
the positions not being filled and
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
whether things like tanif funding will
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
be uh unnecessarily at risk so or what
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
you anything further from committee
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
members any closing remarks with regards
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
stability representative priest for
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
question just as a
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
clarification um there was a discussion
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
early on about the 73 unfunded
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
positions um and you just mentioned
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
another 26 can you just clarify that for
 
04:01:00.399 --> 04:01:01.830 align:start position:0%
another 26 can you just clarify that for
me

04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
please um I I I had indicated 394
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions the 394 the 26 number
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
just back the envelope math from my
 
04:01:13.630 --> 04:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
perspective um that's the general fund
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
in impact over the bium of unfund those
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
so a lot of our positions most of our
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
positions are not 100% generally funded
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
many have mixed funding um so when I've
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
just ran some quick numbers as far as
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
the general fund Financial impact to our
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
budget over the buum it equates to
 
04:01:35.710 --> 04:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
roughly 26 million but I need to go back
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
and and just validate that um the reason
 
04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that is it's more just in
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
terms of what is the what is the global
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
general fund impact and for from a
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
historical perspective for the for The
 
04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
banum Mending June 30th of 2023 we had I
 
04:01:54.429 --> 04:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
I think it was approximately $22.6
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
million Personnel back of the budget
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
reduction um during during that bium
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
that we managed uh through but we did
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
see those vacancy rates slowly tick up
 
04:02:08.229 --> 04:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
process okay thank
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
you okay closing remarks
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you both very much once again
 
04:02:20.590 --> 04:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
a very well prepared
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
presentation uh quite a few follow-up
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
items so hopefully we'll get to those
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
and uh if there's anything else I'm sure
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%

04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
say welcome to division three house

stability thank you so much thank you to
 
04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
all the committee members for the
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide comments my name
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
is Trina Engle finger I am the early
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
care and education policy coordinator at
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
new Futures which is a nonpartisan
 
04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that works on
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
matters relating to health and
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
well-being in New
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and I just want to briefly
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
address uh the committee's questions
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
around costs and benefits and return on
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
investment specific to the child care
 
04:03:55.080 --> 04:03:56.870 align:start position:0%
investment specific to the child care
scholarship

04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
program um broadly I just want to note
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
that what makes investment in child care
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
programming quite unique is that it
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
really is an investment in child
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
development in child care businesses in
 
04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
the state's
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce and also in the state's
 
04:04:20.830 --> 04:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
economy as a whole and just to be a
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific about economic
 
04:04:26.670 --> 04:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
impacts uh there was a report just last
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
month from the New Hampshire fiscal
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
policy Institute that really
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
underscored how much money is lost due
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
to child care shortages in the state and
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
just in terms of State impact alone it
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
ran to the tens of Millions per
 
04:04:48.670 --> 04:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
year and the child care scholarship
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
program is a key scaffold a stabilizing
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
influence in our child care
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that same report from
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
noted that every dollar invested in
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy programs like the child care
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship can yield more than a dollar
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
in economic impacts in the year that it
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
is invested so just wanted to underscore
 
04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
those points I think uh that that report
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
has been shared with the committee I'd
 
04:05:20.670 --> 04:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
be happy to share it if it hasn't um but
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
as the department made clear in its
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
presentation These funds are also more
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
than matched by federal contributions so
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very cost-effective program and
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
um new Futures appreciates and strongly
 
04:05:36.149 --> 04:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
supports the Departments and the
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
governor's budget maintaining and uh
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
supporting funding for the scholarship
 
04:05:42.520 --> 04:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
supporting funding for the scholarship
program

04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:05:46.349 --> 04:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:05:49.229 --> 04:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much for being here
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
I do have a question and if it this may
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
be um off topic but if you don't know
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
just say Senate Bill
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
404 last year are you familiar that
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah okay uh for those on the
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee so that passed last year
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner was a co-sponsor
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's relative to expanding Child Care
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
Professionals eligibility for the child
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program my question is
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh have you seen a difference with the
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
passage of that bill or any comments now
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
that we're a year out from the passage
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
of that Bill thank you so much for the
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
question um I'm certainly not an expert
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
but I have been monitoring closely the
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
roll out of that bill I think that um
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a lot of time because
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
the actual implementation only started
 
04:06:37.640 --> 04:06:38.429 align:start position:0%
the actual implementation only started
in

04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
January and so um it's difficult to see
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
the impacts in recruitment and and
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
retention in such a short time without a
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
lot of data to gather but certainly have
 
04:06:52.030 --> 04:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
heard from some of the participants that
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
it was a game Cher for them in terms of
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowing them to remain in the child
 
04:06:58.040 --> 04:06:59.070 align:start position:0%
allowing them to remain in the child
care

04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce thank you very much appreciate
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for Miss Engle
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%

04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
conversation today uh Trina did a great
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
job uh telling you about you're getting
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
it I had the chance to email you
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday didn't if you had a chance to
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
see it hi thank you um wanted to make
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
sure you had this uh report and also
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
have a specific request so um I really
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
like chairman Edward's question about
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs is it can you make the
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
business case is this you know use good
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
use of taxpayers investing money and so
 
04:08:05.149 --> 04:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
this is really what I'd like to talk to
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
you about and so without going over all
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
the key points which you saw in the
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
email but again as Trina also mentioned
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
um are lost here in New Hampshire both
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
tax and local and state tax revenue
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
families earnings um businesses um
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
returns and losses based on the child
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
care shortage so as you might recall in
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
2023 very much on a bipartisan basis
 
04:08:37.710 --> 04:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
there was a $15 million investment very
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to retain and recruit the
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce and so not only did
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
the the legislature passed that in 2023
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
they also put in hb2 a directive that
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
DHHS included in its next banian budget
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
2627 and they did they did include 15
 
04:09:02.910 --> 04:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
million 7 a half each year and so uh in
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
the Govern in the uh in the governor's
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
budget that was taken out and uh as I
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that's on page
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
881 of the budget at the bottom of the
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
page you'll see a $15 million in our
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
current bium and then a zero going
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
forward and so what I'm here uh hoping
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
to talk with you about is again not only
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
is it a cost of you know are we going to
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
save money by doing this how critical
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
that is but I believe we can also find a
 
04:09:36.189 --> 04:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
way together by looking at what are some
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
of the allowable funding sources to be
 
04:09:41.710 --> 04:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
used for this we did use General funds
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the current bium and of course
 
04:09:46.109 --> 04:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
understand the worry about the uh
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
balancing a budget so really want to
 
04:09:49.950 --> 04:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
work with you to see is there a way we
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
can put it back you know that 7 and a
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
half million a year I really feel is a
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
you know such a smart investment and
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
love to work with you and find what are
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
we believe there are some allowable
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
sources very specifically that could be
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
used for this so we ask that you
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
consider restoring it maintaining that
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
investment and we'd love to work with
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you do you by chance have the
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
section of the previous house bill to
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
related to I will make sure to send it
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
to you yes be glad to send that to you
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you you're welcome any
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions for M Cowell sorry oh I did
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
forget to mention something if I may and
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is many states across the country
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
did invest in giving extra supports to
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
the workforce and again why is this
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
government's role well certainly we all
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
know parents are spending so much more
 
04:10:40.910 --> 04:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
for child care that they can currently
 
04:10:44.030 --> 04:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
afford M making sure that the Workforce
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
of of child care gets sufficient money
 
04:10:49.149 --> 04:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
and has incentives to stay that cannot
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
be born by the parents the hardworking
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
parents that are using it and so those
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
states that have invested many are
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
continuing that investment Beyond um the
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic Etc all of our three um
 
04:11:06.510 --> 04:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
states that border us have continued
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
their investment in a childcare
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce support and
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
incentive yeah understood represent of
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
Daniels for a question yeah thank you do
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of a document that
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
would uh show the the the success or or
 
04:11:25.950 --> 04:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
the failure of the uh of the 15 million
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
that was given thank you for that
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
question the um it just went out in
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
August so even though it was passed in
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
23 it was uh distributed in August of
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
2024 so it's just beginning but um I do
 
04:11:42.030 --> 04:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
believe there was an interim report that
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
um the department was was gathering on
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
some of that which I don't have a copy
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
of but I'll see what we can do to find
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
out it has just started we have
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data certainly that people um
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
felt it was not only a monetary thing
 
04:11:56.670 --> 04:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
which of course is important but it's
 
04:11:58.830 --> 04:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
the recognition of the importance of
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
their work that meant a lot to the Child
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay looks like we're all set thank
 
04:12:13.389 --> 04:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%

04:12:19.229 --> 04:12:19.239 align:start position:0%

04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
