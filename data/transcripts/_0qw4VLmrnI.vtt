in July I retired as president of uh the
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
New England Commission of higher
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
education uh which accredits 220
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities in the six New
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
England states and um 11 American style
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
institutions in other countries um
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
before that I was on the staff there um
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
before that I worked in Dubai um in the
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
United Arab Emirates as uh at zad
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
University which is a new which was then
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
a new National University for local
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
women um I'm on the quality board in uh
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
Iceland which is the quality assurance
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
agency there and quality and
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications Ireland which plays a
 
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
similar function um in that country um
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the board of the national
 
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
student Clearing House which collects
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
data and makes it available um about
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
student enrollment and retention if
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
you've seen um press releases or news
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
articles recently about enrollment being
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
down during the um pandemic um those
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
probably came from the national student
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
claring house um Nei is recognized um by
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
the federal government that's the that's
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
the verb used in the higher education
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
act as quote a reliable Authority as to
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
the quality of education and through
 
00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 align:start position:0%
that recognition it becomes a gatekeeper
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
for federal financial aid for students
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
so students in your institutions that uh
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
have pel grants or Federal loans it's
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
recognition uh accreditation in the US
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
provides quality assurance to the public
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
this is an okay place to go or to send
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
your son or daughter and if it works
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
well um it provides quality improvement
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
for institutions and
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
systems I've also written and um and
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
presented about public higher education
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
systems I find them fascinating um I
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't know any other country that has
 
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
anything quite like that so I want to
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
make a few remarks probably about 10
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
minutes and um and then look forward to
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
your questions and
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
observations uh I did watch your session
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday and I'm impressed with how
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
seriously you're taking the question
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
before you this this would be a
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
significant change um for the two
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
systems for the faculty the students and
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire um it's
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
as Joe morone outlined this is a very
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
challenging time for higher education
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
overall and certainly in New England uh
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
and as Susan Huard uh talked about it's
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
certainly two different systems in terms
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
of missions of Institutions and and
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
levels of programs so I'm not going to
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
offer you an opinion on whether ing
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
these systems is a good idea um but I'm
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to give you some comments and
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
observations and free opinions about um
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
what it looks like to me if you do go
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
forward with a merger um first of all
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
with respect to accrediation um you can
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
find the accreditation standard um on
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
our website if it would be helpful to
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
you I'd certainly be happy to have
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
copies mailed to each of you
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
um based on how seriously you're taking
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
this and um and the expertise within the
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
the systems already I don't anticipate
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
any problem going forward but the
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
standards can be a good overall guide as
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
you bring the two standard systems
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
together to make sure they work well um
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
I would advise that you and the system
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
stay in touch with Nei um they have
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
something called an advisory opinion
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
which is um sort of um institutions or
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
systems asking a question if we did this
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
what would you think and it's designed
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
um as part of what I used to call the
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
surprise Reduction Program um you don't
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
want the accreditor to surprise you and
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
the accreditor doesn't want you
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
surprising them so it's a formalized way
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
to stay in touch um in addition to the
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
informal mechanisms um likely if you do
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
go ahead and merge the systems uh the
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
commission will consider it to be a
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
substantive change which is a term of
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
art from The Higher Education Act and
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
they will approve it and that's also um
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
in in your favor in the sense that once
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
they approve it they've given you the
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
go-ahead on how you plan to go forward
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um that again part of the surprise
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
Reduction Program but probably also
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
required um I want to talk a little bit
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
about the board composition and the
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
proposal that I have seen of um five
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
board members from four-year
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
institutions five from the two-year
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
institutions five by the governor
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
without nomination and ex eight ex
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
officios um my I two main observations
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
about that one in my opinion that is way
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
too many EX
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
officios um it's more common uh in other
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
states to have the chancellor as an ex
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
officio and the head of the K12 system
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
generally both
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
nonvoting um if you're going to have
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
more uh EX officios in that I would give
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
you my strong encouragement to have them
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
be non-voting um you and also you want
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
the perspective of the state agencies
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
and good communication with them but
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to get that one is
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
through regular scheduled meetings and
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
communication mechanisms another is to
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
think of those people as serving on
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees of the board where their
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
expertise is particularly relevant to
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
task of that task of the
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee my second main observation
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
about the proposed composition of the
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
board is um that
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the problem having people quote come
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
from two-year institutions and four-year
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
Institutions and maybe that is necess NE
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
probably is necessary initially because
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the Urgent amount of work that needs
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
to be done but but soon I would
 
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
encourage you to set up a mechanism that
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
the board looks at the whole and knows
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
the new entity and doesn't bring the
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
before with them um so they're invested
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the new that's the entity they get to
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
know um fiduciaries are trustees are
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and it's important for the
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
success of the system
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
that they have the interest of the
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
entire system in in their mind um people
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
are human beings um which is true you
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
know everywhere I've been um and they
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
they will know how they got to the board
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
if they quote come from two-year
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
institutions or come from four-year
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
institutions or from that
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
perspective um I want to talk for a
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
minute now about um the next statement
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
that I hope you got and hope you got a
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
chance to take a look at this was
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
developed with the system heads when I
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
was um working for the commission I used
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
to meet with system heads twice a year
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
and um this grew out of the
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had and it was um
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
a statement that was approved by the
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
commission for system heads to be able
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
to give to Governors and say Here's
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
here's Collective wisdom of the
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
commission and of the system heads about
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
appointing people to um governing boards
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
for systems um it outlined some kinds of
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
expertise that's important Financial
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
expertise legal people in complex
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
systems people with a higher education
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
background people who understand risk
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
management um I think that I want to
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
just stop and emphasize that complex
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
system for a minute I was talking to
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
another to a chancellor of an an unnamed
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
State who said that there are a lot of
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
small businesses in that state and um
 
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
the governor tended to point point
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
people who had um worked in small
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
businesses which are obviously important
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the state important to the economy um
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
in all kinds of ways but there weren't
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
enough people who understood the
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
complexity of an organization like the
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
system and that was a
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
problem um the recommendation is that
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
you look for people that have executive
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
level experience in the public private
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
and voluntary sectors um and another
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
reason is for not having people in the
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the short term after the very short
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
term come from Two and fouryear
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
institutions is that as you as your
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
discussion indicated on Wednesday in a
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
very few years you may have a different
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
composition of Institutions that you
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
have now and I think you would be wise
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
not to lock yourself into um that
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
bifurcation over time clearly clearly
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
all the institutions need to feel that
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
there are people on the board who
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
understand them and understand their
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
perspective so it's not an argument
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
against that it's an argument against
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
locking yourself into a composition and
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
having people appear to come from a
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
um um there's a question about who votes
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
um ex official members in in some places
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
the chancellor votes the president's
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
vote the students vote The Faculty vote
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I would argue none of those people
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
should vote they should all you know
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
whoever you choose to have an ex
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
official member the the voting members
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
should be the
 
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.310 align:start position:0%
should be the
fiduciaries

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
um the board appointments are made by
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
the governor that that is generally
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
common I think there are a few states
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
where legislators make the appointment
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
in more States the governors make the
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
appointment and there's some
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
ratification process by a legislative
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee such as yours or a legislative
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
chamber um so legislators you all are
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
elected to represent a constituency and
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the best of all possible worlds um
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
board members are not they're there to
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
represent not a constituency perhaps a
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
perspective but expertise and the
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
ability to look at the whole and and
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
look out for the common good um
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries have responsibil duties of
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
care and loyalty and obedience so you're
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
looking for expertise and um
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
understanding the mission of the various
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of Institutions but that's not the
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
only factor it's one of many and as I
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
was thinking about this I was reminded
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
of what we used to do and I hope this is
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
a helpful analogy to you um when it came
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
time to elect new Commissioners who
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
served for no more than two threeyear
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
terms um so we would make a little
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet every year my um senior vice
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
president and I and we would put down
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
who was who was going to be there after
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
the people who were leaving were gone um
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
and we wanted representation from the
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
Six States um plus they've recently
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
added International perspective from the
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
um overseas institutions we wanted role
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
representation presidents CFOs academics
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
people who looked after students people
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
who understood distance learning we we
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
added Rec added board members so Cass
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
ardinger who's a trustee of the
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
University system and New Hampshire is a
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
is a commissioner um and we recently
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
added from time to time have had system
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
heads and Todd leech is on the
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
commission right now um Wanted
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
commission needed people from public and
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
private institutions from large and
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
small from the wealthy institutions and
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
the Not So wealthy demography was
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
important men and women uh race and
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
ethnicity were um considered we wanted
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
people who had um some of the people who
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
had good experience shairing or serving
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
on teams so they understood the task of
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
what was going on and by law one out of
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
every members um must be a public member
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact right now the chair of the
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
commission is a public member
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
commission's had lawyers journalists and
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
and um people who had served on higher
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
ed boards but weren't currently
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
serving so um if you hire the right
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
Chancellor um if the board hires the
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
right Chancellor that person will be
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
invaluable in helping the governor um
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
select board members and then I found
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
and I hope you got it also um a
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
statement by the Association of
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
governing boards which is a Washington
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
membership Organization for people who
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
serve on public and independent Boards
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
trustees um and they came out with a
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
statement that um gives you some op
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
suggest some options there for your
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
consideration one is to have and I'm not
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not endorsing any of these but I
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to put some options in front of
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
you and and there's some wise people who
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
worked on that one is to think of having
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
a nominating committee of citizens one
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
is to have some of the board be
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
self-perpetuating and in other words
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
nominated by the board themselves um it
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
talks about the personal characteristics
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
that you'd be looking for and not just
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
the expertise it it emphasizes that
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
point about um keeping it from being
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
political you all and the governor are
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
the politicians the board members are
 
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:21.710 align:start position:0%
the politicians the board members are
the

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and um to make sure that
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
public higher education in New England
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in New England is the
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
best it can possibly be so the main role
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the of the board is to hire and
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
support the chancellor and to hold the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
chancellor accountable that that's the
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
main thing they do just as institution
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
boards their main role is to hire and
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
support the president and hold the
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
president accountable they need to make
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
sure collectively that they set the
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
priorities for the institutions in the
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
system that they do strategic planning
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
that they have wise use of resource and
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
they can hold the institutions and the
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
chancellor accountable a for the
 
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.949 align:start position:0%
chancellor accountable a for the
outcomes

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
um you need I I would encourage that you
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
write this in such a way that the
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
chancellor has sufficient Authority um
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
and one question that sometimes comes up
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
is should the president's report to the
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
board or to the chancellor and my advice
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
is that they um report to the chancellor
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
because you want the board to have
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
remember these are volunteers um as you
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
practically are so you want the board to
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
have enough time to focus on their main
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
duties um they can be privy to the
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the um of the presidents
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
they certainly have a role in hiring
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
them and um determining their contract
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
but the direct reporting I think is from
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
my observation best done to the
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
chancellor um finally I'm getting close
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
to wrapping up here there's a lot of
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
work to bring the two systems together I
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
was uh involved with the main system
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
when they moved to single accreditation
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
I watched how much time that took them
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm watching and have been in touch with
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont right now which is combining
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
three of this of the institutions in its
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
um public system um there needs to be
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
and you heard it on Wednesday um
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring the technological
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
systems together and the purchasing and
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
all of the kind of back office things
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's important um my in my observation
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to take some time and it's
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
going to take some ex expertise of
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
people inside the system and outside the
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
system um outside help so that they can
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
learn from the wisdom of others and
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
their experience um a possibility two
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
possibilities for your consideration and
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
the new systems consideration are Jim
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
paage who's been working with Vermont
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
and led the main system for for I think
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
seven years and also enims the national
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
Center for higher education Management
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
Systems which is the uh author the paper
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
that I think you have about community
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
colleges but they're they're they're
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
neutral they they worked with a lot of
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
systems around the country um in terms
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
of extra support I believe the Vermont
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
system is getting about $8 million to
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
help it in the first year um and and um
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
and possibly more after that um there
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
was elusion to in the in the reason for
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
doing this in some discussion Wednesday
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
as I recall the transfer of credit issue
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that is um a a very
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
important issue um it's not something
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
that has done well in this country in my
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
opinion um I have served EX oficio on a
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
trans a task force on transfer by the
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
American council of education which is
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the umbrella group in Washington for
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
higher education their report is coming
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
out this coming week and it emphasizes
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the importance of getting the
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
transfer issue done correctly on the
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
task force when we heard the staff
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
present you know the first um highlight
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
level ideas of what they were wanted the
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
report to say um there were several of
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
us ex officio but the task force members
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
themselves were college and university
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
presidents and they uniformly said make
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
it more urgent this this is really
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
important we we need to ramp up the
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
language and get people to pay attention
 
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.270 align:start position:0%
language and get people to pay attention
to

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.310 align:start position:0%
to
this

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
finally um I will say although I know
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
you know it that there are reputational
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
issues for public higher education in
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for doing what you what
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
you are proposing to do um to make sure
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
that the higher ed system has sufficient
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
autonomy that the chancellor can serve
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
as CEO that there is support from the
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislature on how to get there that the
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
legisl legislature reflects confidence
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
in public higher education um and its
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
importance to the not only the state's
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
economy but it's to its Civic and
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
cultural life as well so um I I wish you
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
the very best I look forward to your
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions and if I can be of any help to
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
you at all going forward I'm I'm happy
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much Dr brittenham
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh you indicated you'd be willing to
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
take questions that's correct yes
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely I I do have one and then uh
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll have the committee have
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
some further uh when we are talking
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
about this uh broad uh uh new uh system
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
involving a different board uh five5 and
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
five uh and the chancellor reports
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
directly to that board and presidents
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
report directly and are accountable to
 
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.350 align:start position:0%
report directly and are accountable to
the

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
chancellor um in our system we currently
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
have 11 Community College seven
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
community colleges and we have four uh
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh with Granite State we have four
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
University level uh programs that's a
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
total of 11 um now if the chancellor is
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
going to have direct responsibility for
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
the presidents of all 11
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
institutions is there need in our form
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
of governance to have for example a vice
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
Chancellor uh an individual I know as a
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
previous administrator myself if you
 
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
have to evaluate and look at performance
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
and also be responsible for all those
 
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.390 align:start position:0%
and also be responsible for all those
fiscal

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
matters uh I don't know how one chanc is
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
going to do it um and also uh and the
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
second part of that question yes we we
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
are initially merging community college
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
and university system so there are those
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
mission statements associated with each
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
right now would it be wise to have a
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
vice Chancellor that has more um uh
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
understanding and perhaps uh awareness
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
of our community college system so
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's uh working with the chancellor
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
the we don't sort of put the community
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
couch in in the back of the room well
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question you
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to put the community college
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the back room but it's also um at
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
least theoretically possible that the
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
chancellor has a community college
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
background and what you would need in
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
that case is somebody that has a um a
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
four-year graduate background so I you
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
know the I think you're the premise of
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
your question is is excellent about you
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
know looking after an evaluating 11
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
presidents is going to be um a
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
significant deal um so you do want to
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
provide the chancellor with some support
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
that will B balance his or her and
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
extend his or her expertise and
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
background generally there's a chief
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
academic officer a Chief Financial
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
Officer um legal counsel um often some
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
someone with expertise in in HR um so I
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
would encourage you there are some
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
organizations of systems there are two
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
of them that come to mind and one of
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
them is shio the State Higher Education
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
executive officers and the other is Nash
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
the National Association of system heads
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
they and enms could be helpful to you in
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
looking at systems of similar size and
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
complexity um enms could be helpful
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
there J paage could be helpful there
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
looking at that and giving you some
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts about you know what's what's an
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate size and uh range of
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
expertise that the chancellor would need
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be helpful but your question is good
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
a good one uh one one question for our
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
um committee researcher Jen did you get
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
the names of the organ organizations
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
that uh Dr britam just
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
referenced I didn't scribble them all
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
down no
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
Jennifer why don't you write to me you
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
know and I'll be happy absolutely okay
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very much doctor
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
um are there questions from the
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee at this
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
time yes represent luno thank thanks
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
very much um uh Rick and and thank you
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
Dr brittingham for joining us this
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
morning um I took a lot to not and and
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
your the information I think you you you
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
you bring forward's been been really
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
very helpful um I sort of wanted to step
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
back a little bit you you um you you
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
said you you watched the um uh the
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
meeting we had I think it was on was on
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Monday this week I don't
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
remember what yeah um when uh when um I
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
think it was chair Marone was was really
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
laying out um the uh the problems that
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
both the the um university system as
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
well as the community col college system
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're facing you know in terms of
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment and there's been lots of you
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
know know you know it's not just a New
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem um you know clearly
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
but um but but obviously both systems
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
are going to need to make some
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments in order to um to to address
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
that and to and to provide you know a
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
path forward for um for you know uh you
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
know sustainability and making sure that
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
that they can continue to meet the needs
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
of um of uh you know Granite sters uh
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
but um but leading up to um I I don't I
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't even want to say leading up to the
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
problem I guess what I'm wondering is
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
what would what would like a decision
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
tree look like for deciding whether or
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
not merger is needs to be something
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's done either prior to solving a
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
problem or in parallel with with solving
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
um the problem well it could depend on
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
what the problem is of course um you
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
know I think uh as I look at New England
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
states if you know if you can do a
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
thought experiment and there were no
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
systems and no institutions of higher
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
education but roughly the population and
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
the economy and whatever of the States
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't set it up the way it is in
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
many cases and Connecticut is a great
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
example Connecticut doesn't have a large
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
footprint and they have 12 separate
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
community colleges and um and and they
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
are um looking to merge them into a
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
single Community College I'm not
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting that as a solution but my
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
point is I think if you were if you
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
stick with that thought experiment and
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
say you're going to set up community
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
colleges in Connecticut how are you
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to do it you probably wouldn't
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
have 12 totally independent ones today
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
so I think um I think thinking about you
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
know what makes sense today and figuring
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
out how to get from here to there
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
um I I think I think that's a a key
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
issue is you know that the the question
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
you ask is a very good one I'm not sure
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
I can give you a very good answer off
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I think figuring
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
out the timing and what you can do when
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
and how to keep how to keep the
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
institutions and the systems Now
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
supported until something else happens
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
assuming something else will happen
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
because life is going to go on you know
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully everybody will be back
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
on campus if they want to be back on
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
campus in the fall but this is still
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
going to be disruptive times and I was
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
also struck and I had found the numbers
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
from something else I'm writing about
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
the um the high number of high school
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
graduates from New Hampshire who leave
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
the state and I think you know I I would
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
encourage you to think about that as a
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
priority how can we do this in a way
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
that keeps more of our bright students
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
here hopefully to help New Hampshire in
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
the long run to keep your talent here
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
you want to attract outside talent but
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
you don't want to lose you know too much
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
of your current
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
Talent right um no thank thanks very
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
much thank thank you very much further
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
questions represent Miler uh thank you
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
Rick and thank you for being here this
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
morning uh the uh data that we got on
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
Wednesday was very
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
sobering and there is this sense of the
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
sky is
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
falling uh and I think the sense of the
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
sky is falling is representative in the
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal to try to merge the
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
system via the budgetary
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
process and the question that I have for
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
you is
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
um in this Panic state that we're in how
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
does one step
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
back and go slow to go fast go slow
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
enough that's right well I mean you set
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
up a group to plan it so that they come
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
back to you with a a a stronger
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation that would be one
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
possibility I again I'm sure enims could
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
give you other possibilities for this um
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
I think you want um I think you need to
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
think about what is it from what you've
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
heard what you read what you know what
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know of New Hampshire of some um
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
characteristics of what you would be
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
looking for um and you know it may be
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
one characteristic would be a strong
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
Chancellor CEO one characteristic might
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
be um you know um uh the emphasis that
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
came first from the governor as I read
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
things on making sure that students more
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
students go from two-year and complete
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree if that's a priority
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
to you then I would put you know put the
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
sake in the ground and set up you know
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
five seven some number of key points and
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
take a year to design it okay um perhaps
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
while searching for a Chancellor if
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're committed to making it go through
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
um I think I think you could done well I
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
think you would have a great talent pool
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
to come here um it's a New Hampshire's a
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful State I don't have to tell you
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
that and this is these are challenging
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
times and this could be an exciting
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for somebody who wants to
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
get this right what what your priorities
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think one of the for example
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I think it would it's likely true in
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well is to make sure
 
00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:00.039 align:start position:0%
look after the community college and
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
also look after your research
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
University um and and that's kind of and
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
you've got you know some in between
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
there and granite States got an very
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
interesting record so you've got a a
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
really good array and and part of what I
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
hope you would want to do is to make
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the missions of the different
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of Institutions that you have are
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
are supported and recognize and find a
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
good home in the in a new system that
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
you would create so follow
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
Rick so from what I hear you saying is
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a need to do some
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation some
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
assessment some
 
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.909 align:start position:0%
assessment some
planning

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
prior to making any kind of a
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
significant merge that would lock the
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
state in to a system that hasn't gone
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
through that pre-planning pre-planning
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
process is that correct I think that's
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
correct I mean one thing you hopefully a
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
goal that you have is to get it right so
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
that they don't right back to you and
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
saying we need to change the law because
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
working right you've got other things to
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
do and so the the what you can do to
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
make it you know to increase your
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
likelihood that you get it as right as
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
possible when you pass it um and that
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you couldn't do something
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
intermediary set up something to make it
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
happen to come back to you in a year
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
um it kind of goes back to to a concern
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
that I would have is said where you have
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
ready fire aim rather than Ready Aim
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
Fire and it's the it's the aiming fi
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's the aiming process that needs to
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
take some time even within this Panic
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
state that we're in right now to make
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we get it right yeah uh when
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
we finally come thank you for your
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
Ellison can you hear me artart you're
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
art there you go thank you I got it
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you R thank you doctor for being
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
here today just a question we're talking
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
about a complicated process going
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
forward would you have some sense of who
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
the key groups are that should be
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
involved in this process I know that's
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
could be a long answer to a broad
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
question but any idea of who the key
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
people are or groups that ought to be
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
inv involved in what's going on well
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
sure obviously you all um I think the
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
the current systems the institutions um
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
the um the the ex officials that were
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
suggested by the governor you know they
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
they clearly have a perspective and and
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
a stake in making sure that this works
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
so listening to people from different
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
sectors Community you know um an open
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
process I think can help give a message
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
reinforce your message that this is
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
really important work um there are
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
probably alumni groups I don't know if
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
the various institutions or programs
 
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
have advisory groups um um you know in
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
Maine where they have the University
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
main system of credits this depending on
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
how you count six or seven um
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
institutions they rotate their meetings
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
go around and and have a regional
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
meetings so that they can listen to
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
people uh from different regions so you
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
want and the community colleges
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
illustrate that the importance around
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the state um of the high public higher
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
education thank
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative Oliver
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
Ford Mr chairman thank you Dr brittenham
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh a question for you about the I'm
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
looking at the AGB statement suggestions
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations for Governors and
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislators yep um you had referred to
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
them and earlier in one of your remarks
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes and it's not so much the specifics
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
of that though they're obviously very
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
interesting but the sort of expectation
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we could create an entirely
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
apolitical um somewhat idealistic group
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh to be over the university system in a
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
highly politicized environment prior to
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire I was in
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and Pennsylvania and
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all of them highly
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
political and every one of those things
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we're involved in had a lot of
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
political interplay if you to put it in
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
polite terms yeah
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
um any Enlightenment you could share
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
with us if I'm your experience of
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
working around these things of how we
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
can acknowledge what we necessarily have
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge but still move to a
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat more ideal State apart from
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that yes I think that's a great
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
observation about one of the main
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
messages there and you know given um who
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
worked on it I'm sure that was in part
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
of reaction to things that they had seen
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
where that wasn't F involved I live for
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
25 years in Rhode Island and God knows
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's no politics there so maybe you
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
would look to
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
that I think you know the um the idea of
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
having um that citizen nominating
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
committee is one one possibility I'm not
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
endorsing it but you know there you
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
could set up a composition that is at
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
least Le balance um and um look at it
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
that way I think um terms are another
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
way to do it because politics change so
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to get some of it you got
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
yeah you got human beings here but so
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
the thing that you can do is to take
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
look at that paper and say are there
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
ideas in there that make sense for New
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now that we can um at least
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
have small P political and not capital P
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
political in
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Moffet thank you Mr
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Dr bringham for being
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
with us today I took like represent luno
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
I have lots of notes as well thank you
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I I spent seven years in the
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
University system or 12 if you count my
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
five years as an undergrad and I also
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
spent 20 years in the community college
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
system so I know a bit about the two
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
different cultures yeah and here's
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
something that I see is a is a problem
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
going forward is that the 55 breakdown
 
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:25.349 align:start position:0%
going forward is that the 55 breakdown
uh

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
education uh was saying there's very
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
hierarchical and I completely expect uh
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
given the better the greater numbers in
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the University system compared to the
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
community college system I I'm telling
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
you the folks in the University system
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be saying well you know we're
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
under represented in terms of per capita
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh you I think you're tracked me a
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
little bit right so I don't know if that
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
can be counted by the appointees to skew
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
it towards the university any thoughts
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
on on that
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
Dynamic yeah I I would you know I again
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
I I think having some representation and
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
you might even think about writing this
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
into a law somehow about making sure
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's an immediate appointment that
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
ensures some enough continuity but also
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
brings in some New Perspectives and then
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
think about how to do it in language
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
that ensures appropriate
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
representation um if you put criteria
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
for who should be on the board
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
considerations analogous to those
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
criteria that I recited from what Nei
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
does you want you know you want
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient representation of x y and z
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
um which was never Quantified it didn't
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
mean that there had to be you know three
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
CFOs on the commission there needed to
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
be enough and so if there was a
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
president who'd been a CFO we knew we
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
had Financial expertise in that person
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I think coming up with a list of
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
General overall criteria that you're
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
looking for um and using words like
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient um
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
and and staying away from numbers at
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
least after the first
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
appointments sure thank you you know
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully when transfer gets better
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have people who um on the on the
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees who have been at the
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
community college and went on to get you
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
know foury year and and maybe a graduate
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
degree so they've seen it all yeah thank
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mofet uh
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
dror I have uh a couple other questions
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
having uh served on behalf of speaker on
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
the trustees at the University system
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh about four or five
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
years ago um we were starting to see
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
issues uh surfacing in terms of
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
duplicity of programming um from the
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
community college to the four-year
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
system and amongst the four-year system
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
as well um at what point or let me start
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
that question a little differently other
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
states I'm sure have had the same
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
states I'm sure have had the same
experience

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
um how have they addressed that uh
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ownership in all these
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
local communities well we have a nursing
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
program here and we can't let go of that
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
and jobs are related to it etc etc but
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the long run uh Joe Moran presented
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
some real uh startling figures to us
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
this this decreasing demographic that
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
we've lost 20% of our population in the
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
last 20 years we've gone from like uh
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
220,000 K through 12 students down to
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
about 160,000 students 165,000 students
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
and that's projected to continue to
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
decrease and you spoke earlier of yes
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're exiting more kids out of the state
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
to go to a higher education than we're
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
retaining in our own state so we have
 
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.710 align:start position:0%
retaining in our own state so we have
some

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
significant issues which we have to
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
address uh so in doing so we're looking
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
at a possible merger here but how do we
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
address this issue of duplicity and
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
programming and Facilities throughout
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
this teeny State of New
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you that's a great
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
question too um first of all um there
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
are somewhere between 23 and 28 I don't
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
remember the number of states that have
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
allow two-year institutions to do some
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
four-year degrees I'm not suggesting
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea and they tend to be
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
geographically large states
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
so that students um would have another
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity second um looking at the
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
past is only going to be partially
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
helpful in looking toward the future
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
because there are all kinds of
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
predictions and I think at least a lot
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
of them are going to be true that this
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic has really um the the good side
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
of it as it were is that it's increased
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
capacity and in many places confidence
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
in distance learning so um so you know
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
we'll stick with nursing as an example
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
example if you were in Florida in the
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
past you would have said we need more
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
nurses we'll have the two-year colleges
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
they can't give all four-year degrees
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
but we'll let them give nursing degrees
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
now it's possible that the four-year um
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
institutions can take over through
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
distance learning so you've got another
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
Choice I'm not saying one is better than
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
the other but there are more choices now
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
because of the distance head the other
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
thing is that New Hampshire has and Joe
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
may have cited the number but it's going
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
to be high people with some college but
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
no degree and um and that's another you
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
know idea to think about as you think
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
about what do you want from a new
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
Arrangement is um greater success that
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
can be a hard group to reenroll because
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
in many cases they left because it
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't working for them um and so
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
bringing them back is not always an easy
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
thing but it's another way to boost the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
educational level of a state is to is to
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
have th many of those people come back
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
and earn a
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
degree thank you so uh have you have you
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
seen any locations where they've had to
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
close a campus I've read literature
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
where we're going to see in the next few
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
years 25% of our colleges going out of
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
business in the country um in most cases
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
people are talking about independent
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
institutions um so you can merge and
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
close and and there was an announcement
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
in The Chronicle of Higher Ed um this
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
week about a new Trans transformational
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
part ship fund I should remember the
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
name on it because I'm I'm on their
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
academic Advisory Group and it's the
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
idea is to make um grants up to
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 available to institutions that
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
serve high need students to talk about
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
forms of partnership so that's something
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
that you might want to look at as well
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
um they're very interested in supporting
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
um uh students of color but also
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
institutions that have high levels of um
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
students with financial need generally
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
students with pel grants
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
um it's you know closing closing a
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
public institution of higher education I
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
am struggling to think of that
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
happening um in Vermont you know there
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
was a proposal to do that and now they
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
have a different Chancellor and had one
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
within 10 days I believe um it it's just
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
really hard in Maine their smallest
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
campus was at Machias and it was
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
um approaching unsustainable ility the
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment had fallen off I think
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're down to about 700 students right
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
now and so what they did was make it a I
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
forget the term they use but essentially
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
a branch Campus of the
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
flagship um and so you know Solutions
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
differ that they're looking for that
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
merger in Vermont there's going to be
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
con I mentioned Connecticut there are
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
going to be more things going on and the
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
the geography and the character um are
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
are different in every state but you
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
know I think it's a it's an argument
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
for looking ahead as well as learning
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
from what people have done in the past
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
because looking ahead is going to be
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
different demographically and
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
technologically it's also going to be
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
different because there are things like
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know Google and some other of the
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
big firms are coming out with these
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
short-term credentials um I think it
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
would be wise for institutions to
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate those in degrees for for
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
people who have them and um because the
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
because the degree will go beyond the
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
work force employment you know you want
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
your degrees to improve Civic life and
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
cultural life in the state and and as
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
well as the economic life for
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
people certificate's not going to do
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
much for your cultural life thank you
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank thanks Rick um and
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and so so obviously there's there's a
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
couple of levels of I guess urgency here
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's urgency with respect to
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
the um the community college system
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
system and the university system in in
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
addressing this you know sort certainly
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what um of what um um
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
chair Marone talked about earlier this
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
week but there's also you know an
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
urgency at the legislative um in the
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
legislature because it's budget writing
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
time right and and the question is you
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
know what you know what what
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
accommodations would need to be put into
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
the budget um in order to support um
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's a study or whether it's
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
actual implementation of a of a merge
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
but um in your experience and and maybe
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
some of the the examples you've talked
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
about might help shed some light on this
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
but but what does the you know when you
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
when when merging um systems like this
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
um what is the sort of the cash flow
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
what does the cash flow look like
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
related to the merger effort well again
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
I yeah I'm not sure I'm going to be able
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
to give you a very good answer there but
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
I I would incer encourage you to think
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
about whether you do it from All I'm
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm going to change my verb tense
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
and assume you are going to do something
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
here okay um whether you do it now or
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
whether you have a whether you make a
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
commitment to do it and set a date out
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
there in the meantime X will happen
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
these if these two systems are going to
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
come together again they're going to
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
need some support for integrated
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
technology and they're going to need
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
some outside advice they're going to
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
need you know the people who are there
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
at the institutions and at the system
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
office are trust me fully engaged now
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
given everything that's going on and
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
next year probably won't be as
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
disruptive as this year but it's going
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be a hard year in many ways so some
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
out some extra help for the people who
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
are there maybe over Summers and
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
bringing in some help for people I think
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an efficiency move um
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
in the long run and an effectiv and move
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
because you want it if you're going to
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
do this you want it to go well and if it
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
takes a little extra money to help help
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
it go well and that reflects your
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in people to make it go well
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
and your and your um statement of
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
support for the importance of public
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
higher education for New Hampshire then
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know I would encourage you to do
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
that so so um when when you're talking
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
about a little extra money though I mean
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
is that like in the context of of the um
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
the both both systems you know operating
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
budgets operating budgets um you know
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
maybe you up some kind of group that has
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
an official charge and you give them
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
some support so that they can help
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
figure out um you know what exactly what
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
is needed I I would encourage you to to
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
talk to um Vermont Sophie zne um who is
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
the interim CH I think she's inter
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
anyway she's effectively the chancellor
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
now of the three St and ask her how'
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
they figure this out and there's a a
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and Jim paage is
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
working with them and has worked with
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
Sophie and talked to them about how did
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
they figure out how much this was going
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
to cost and it's not it's not the same
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
problem but it's a similar State and a a
 
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.870 align:start position:0%
problem but it's a similar State and a a
Now

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
Now
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
problem great great thanks very much
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
Barbara Rick you're muted yeah Dr britam
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow up on what representa
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
luno was you know
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
discussing um so in the next
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
year or so would it be wise for us to
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
establish uh from uh
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
membership on the trustees of the
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
University system membership from the uh
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
Community College a coordinating Council
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
of sorts to come out and we're we're
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
find we're we're identifying a lot of
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
different considerations and questions
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
associated with the merger everything
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
from accreditation to transfer credits
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
to fiscal management Etc um governance
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh so a coordinating Council
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
working with the legislature um or at
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
least coordinating with the legislature
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a higher education study
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee established in the rsas
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
currently and so coming out and trying
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
to identify some of the issues and pro
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
propose various
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
resolutions prior to are actually
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
getting into the merger and in the short
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
term maintain funding independently for
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
for the community college and for the
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
University system I guess I'm looking at
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
slowing it down a little bit um could
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
you respond to any of that please well
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
you know the more I listen to you and
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
think about this I think slowing it down
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit and you know if you slow
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
down a little bit you can increase your
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
probability of getting it right um this
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
is a big step um and I think having a
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
designated group with some some people
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
from the two um boards but think about
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
are there one or two or three other
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
people you want in there also so it's
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
not again it's that fiduciary and not
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
just you know representative idea um and
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
you would know who they are or you could
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
you can have help figuring out who they
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
are but um somebody it might be somebody
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
from out of state even but somebody who
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
could come in and help them think about
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
forward not just understanding who we
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
are now we need to understand who we are
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
now but we need also need to think about
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
where is it we want to be and how can we
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
come back with a proposal that gives us
 
00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
the best shot at getting
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Ford yeah thank
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh Dr bringham I was
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
wondering about the possibility in this
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
since we have a lot of pressure on one
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
side from move ahead move ahead and a
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure from the other side to
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't change anything of maybe
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
floating a partial exercise which is an
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
intermediate objective in all of this
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
which is transferability of credits and
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
before talking to anybody about anything
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
else say we would like all of them to
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
begin to communicate about how they can
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
make their courses transferable among
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
them and it turned out at least in
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to be really a sit down at
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
the table kind of thing what do you call
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
and we work by course descriptions yeah
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
and basically it was hammered out but it
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
gives something to say you're moving
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
ahead on and get moving people in unison
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
without having to really spend any money
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's just done in committees and I just
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
wondered if that made sense to you well
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
that can certainly go forward and I
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
think um you know it's um again it's not
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
an easy issue um I you could have two
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
things going on one one a committee and
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
the other your clear message Mage about
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
start working on transfer right now um
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not course by course um I
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
was a dean at the University of Rhode
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
Island and we had a transfer agreement
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
with the Community College of Rhode
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
Island and what we found was that you
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
know if we were looking at six courses
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't carve up the same
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
subject matter in the same way and
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
rather than rewrite all those courses
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
what we did was take a block of them you
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
know if you took this six we'd count
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
them as that six and so there's there's
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
more than one way to do it is that I
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
have to ask is that MO antlers on your
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
wall there uh elk it's an elk it's an
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
elk thank I'm sorry I didn't mean it to
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
be a distraction no no that's okay if
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
you look the other way you see the
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
inflatable children's house where they
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
bounce in so okay all right he shot that
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
elk when he was down at UMass L working
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
institution RI Rick I got a question uh
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
doctor you you mentioned earlier on your
 
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.829 align:start position:0%
doctor you you mentioned earlier on your
uh

00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
first part of your presentation about
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation can you explain exactly
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
how does that work from a standpoint on
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
a campus by campus basis so in essence
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
if if we were to merge this
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
institution how are these campuses
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
individually accredited is is there a
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
universal accreditation exactly how does
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
that work great question so it part of
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
it comes back to how The Higher
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
Education Act is written because again
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
of this link to Federal financial aid
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so right now as of June one of the
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
my last Commission meeting before I
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
retired the commission approved that
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
they would accredit the University of
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
Maine system and and no longer the
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
individual institutions and they did
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
that because the University of Maine um
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
the the UN the separate institutions and
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
the system and certainly the governing
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
board wanted more academic sharing than
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
the commission than the accreditation
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
process could could accomplish so if
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
you've got you know Keen State and
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State doing a a degree program
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
together accreditation can handle that
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
if you've got Granite State and the
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
university doing one the university can
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
handle that but if they if Maine was
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
going to be as successful as they wanted
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
to be then when the accreditation team
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
showed up everything was going to be so
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
mixed up that they couldn't figure out
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
who to hold accountable for the quality
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
of the academic program and that's
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately why they decided to go for um
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
for accreditation of the system but we
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
had to go to the Department of Education
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
and we hired one lawyer instead of two
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
because we wanted only one opinion we
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
didn't want two opinions we had get if
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
we had two lawyers or three opinions um
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
we hired a lawyer together to see if the
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
way the law was written for the
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
University of Maine system if it could
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
count as quote an institution of higher
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
education in The Higher Education Act
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the lawyer said yes and the
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
department said yes and so with that in
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
mind then the accreditor Nei and and the
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
system could go ahead together toward
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
that process I think it will it's it's
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
not a it's not a solution for everyone
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
um but for Maine I think it's a good
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
solution but in our state in New
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire each of the individual states
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh institutions are now accredited 11 of
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
them are separately accredited correct
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
really yep so that would that would be a
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
that would be one of the issues that
 
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
would have to be addressed in if if
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
these campuses were emerge then right so
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
you you know I mean you yes and there
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
are possibilities there and again that's
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
the you know stay in touch with your
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
creditor advice and if you come up with
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
an idea or if you set up a committee and
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
the committee comes up with an idea and
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
they think well we would like to do it
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have one system I'm making
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
this up and I usually make up ridiculous
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
examples but I can't think of anything
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
totally ridiculous at this moment so we
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
want the 11 we want the seven community
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
colleges accredited as one and we want
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
the four-year institutions accredited by
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
want I don't think that's a very good
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
idea by the way for other reasons but if
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's what they wanted to know would
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
the commission approve that that's when
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
they could go in with an advisory
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
opinion and say here's what we would
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
like to do here's some you know 20 pages
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
of Pros about why we think it's a good
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
idea and how it would work send it in
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
the staff our corporate motto was weere
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
a draft of anything they would take it
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
to a commission meeting if if the answer
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't obvious they'd take it to a
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
commission meeting and the commission
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
would come back and say no you can't do
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
it because of X or yes you can do it or
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
um or we don't quite understand this
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
part over here or you can do it if you
 
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:40.150 align:start position:0%
part over here or you can do it if you
do

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
L thank you uh uh Mike I'd like to just
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
follow up on one thing that uh
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative Myer had and then get to
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
you in a second but uh doctor in terms
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
of accrediting let's take for example
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
Keen state
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
um are we talking about accrediting Keen
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
state are we talking about accrediting a
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
program such as nursing with in Keen
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
State could you get some clarification
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
for me please sure sure so what nii does
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
is accredit Keen State there are nursing
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
accredit there are specialized
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
accreditors in various areas so the law
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
school at the University of New
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example is accredited by
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
the ABA in nursing there are I think now
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
three accreditors because they don't
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
agree with each other on how it's done
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
but your nursing um programs are
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
accredited by a nursing accreditor and
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
again um in the case of nursing um and
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
the case of law they are recognized by
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
the federal government um if they any
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
accreditor that's a gatekeeper your
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
business programs are not they're not
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers to to Fe to federal funds of
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
any kind so and there are three
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
different um business accreditors and
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
they all operate separately if you go if
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
you want to read about specialized
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation I would say the best place
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
to go is ch.org c h ea.org
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
um and they'll lay all that out thank
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
you so if uh Kean loses their nursing
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
accreditation from the nursing program
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's accrediting them yeah do does Nei
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
get involved with that at all Yes um so
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know that would obviously put
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
students at risk and so um ne's concern
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
would be what are you going to do to
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
protect the student
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
um do you plan to U we have there's a a
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
system where they would know where nii
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
would know that that happened so Nei
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
would be in touch with Keen State and
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
say you know how are you protecting the
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
students are you can you arrange for
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
them to transfer someplace sometimes
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
specialized accreditors will say you
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
lose it at the end of that you know if
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
they come in October and make a decision
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
you've lost it in May so that you're not
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
you know you're not disrupting the
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
current students um that the program
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
would be accredited until they graduate
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
if they're seniors but ne's concern is
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
um what are you doing to protect
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
students are you planning to fix the
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
problems and go back and then depending
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
on what the problems are sometimes it's
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
a question of is the problem here a
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
general problem so again I'm going to
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
try to make up an example here on the
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
Fly um nursing lost its accreditation
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
because the library is locked and they
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't have electronic access and so
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
nursing students can't get Library
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
materials um that's obviously a
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
that the nursing accreditors found it
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
but it's obviously a problem that would
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
affect all the students at Keen State
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
sorry we're picking on Keen
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
state so in followup just on this this
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
topic so then we're talking about the
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
system as it exists right now currently
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
what happens if we decide we're going to
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
have our nursing program as part of the
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
overarching whole
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
umbrella uh new trustee system and so
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now getting our
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
nursing program for ke un for Plymouth
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
state for all the community colleges
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
accredited as a one program is that
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
possible and are there any institutions
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
doing this the simple answer is I'm not
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody doing it B it
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately depends on the accreditor
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
um so there may be accreditors out there
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
who would do that but I'm sure not all
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
of them would and I can't speak for the
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
nursing creditors
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Moffett yeah yeah
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm a history guy but if I
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
was to quantify this it would start off
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
with an equation 7 + 4 = 11 which is
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
pretty simple but uh then as we keep
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
working this equation that gets bigger
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
and bigger and there variables anyway I
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to bring up one variable that we
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
haven't touched on and and I I don't
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
know if you have any thoughts on this
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
but Washington
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
DC uh I think is will be a variable in
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
this this equation and some fashion I
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
don't know what but I'm looking at the
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
several people last year ran for
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
president on a platform that included
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
free Community College tuition I'm
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the president's comprehensive
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
plan here real quick says providing two
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
years of community college or other
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
highquality training programs tuition
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
free making public colleges universities
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
tuition free for all families who earn
 
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.750 align:start position:0%
tuition free for all families who earn
under

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
$125,000 of increased funding for p
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
grants so anyway I uh do you have any
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
sense of what might flow from Washington
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
I know there's there there's a new
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
cabinet official there I any thoughts or
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
yeah um again well um uh Larry scha my
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
successor meets with the other Regional
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
creditors and they collectively hire um
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
the term is lobbyists they they I worked
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
with them for years they're fabulous and
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
they connect regional accreditation with
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Washington so that
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
would be one way to find out the Higher
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
Education Act will was last reauthorized
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
in 2008 I think it was and they're
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to do it every five years so
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're running just a little
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
bit behind on that um the projections
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
last I heard nobody was hyper optimistic
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
that they'll get it done now but it's
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
possible they would take an idea like
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
that and write it into the higher ed act
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
or they might do it separately um as a
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
separate law I I I don't really know you
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
know so for for our planning purposes
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
probably need to be careful about
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
assuming uh too much out of uh
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:37.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh doctor we have uh a number of
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
non-traditional students who attend our
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
community college system older students
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
than the university system which caters
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
more to the one the recent
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
graduate um have you seen in any of the
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
other mer mergers throughout New England
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
or the country where there has been a
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
negative impact to the cost that this
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
non-traditional student has been able to
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
get into the community college for
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
either a certificate or a two-year
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
degree at a very uh uh a lessened cost
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
than you would for a four-year degree
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
have you seen any negative results that
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
due to a merger there's been fewer
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
non-traditional students participating
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
in in postc we have 65 25 65 65 25 uh
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get you know by 2025 65%
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
of our kids with a working skill or a
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
two or foure degree uh I don't want to
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
see that you know uh hurt um and lose
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
our non-traditional students uh so do do
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
we see that the Community College tends
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
to um lose traditional students due to
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
maybe the costs for that tuition
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
increasing at the community college
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
level when you have a merger another
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
good question Mims again would be in a
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
better position than I am to answer the
 
01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:05.799 align:start position:0%
question I will say that um Connecticut
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
in I think it was
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
2011 com put its two-year institutions
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it's foure not not not the flagship
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
but the the regional campuses the
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
four-year um state universities into a
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
single system along with Charter Oak
 
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
which is roughly analogous to Granite
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
State so it's one system and I do know
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the enrollment at the community
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
colleges has gone down I don't know if
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I I wouldn't you know
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
but again that's another group that you
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
might want to be in contact with and see
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
if you know see if in Connecticut people
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
think that that was part of what
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
happened thank you hey Rick can I ask a
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
question along those lines sure what so
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
you brought up 65 by 25 which is which
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
is obviously been an initiative uh here
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but across the country
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
at different um
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
you know proportions and and and time
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
frames um in every state but um but you
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
know one of the things I learned
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
recently at an nhti which is the
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
community college in conquered um at an
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
Advisory board meeting was that um um
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
65% of their prospective students are
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
looking for not necessarily for two-year
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
degrees but for high value um
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
certificates and um um so that they can
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
go right into the workforce and so you
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
know given given that should should the
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
should the state also be looking at
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
possibly re-evaluating the the 65 by 25
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
um goal and whether that just applies to
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
twoyear and four-year degrees or does it
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
expand beyond that yeah I think that's a
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
little above my pay grade I don't know
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
um uh that's a good question I'm not
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
sure I have much to contribute there you
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
know I will say that um given the rise
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
of distance learning and given what
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
institutions and faculty you know
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
faculty from all reports I've heard
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
around the country did a you know HED is
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
not known for changing quickly um all
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
the time and um but the general reports
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
that I've heard about faculty stepping
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
up to the plate and offering programs
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
through distance learning has been
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
terrific some of them even love it you
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
know and um so going forward that's
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to be different and I think um
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's related to the transfer issue
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
making those certificates avail able but
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
thinking systematically about how can we
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that that lets the student
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
leave with a pathway toward a degree
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
whether that's a two-year degree or a
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
four-year degree and looking again and
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
this is be a fresh opportunity to look
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
again at the line between the credit and
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
non-credit things that students do um
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
you know at some community colleges and
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to any of yours about this
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
the you know they're very responsive to
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
the local employers and come up with um
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
certificates that are are noncredit in
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
areas where maybe some other community
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
colleges have degree programs there we
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
did a study um Nei did a study about
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
three years ago and I guess they're
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
repeating it where we looked at
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
institutions that had low graduation
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
rates and we wrote to them and said you
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
know this is the information we have we
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
want seven pages please I used to teach
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
seventh grade so I know the answer to
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
the book report question how long should
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
it be we want seven pages of do we have
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
the right numbers what else do you know
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
about retention graduation and transfer
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
what are you doing about it and what do
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know about how successful it is and
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
what are you planning to do in the
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
future and we got back they weren't all
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
uniformally good we got some back that
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
were wonderful and the one that sticks
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
in my mind was um Community College I
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't remember which one it was that
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
said we have a program for welders and
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
um when welders go out for their you
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
know internship or whatever they call it
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
the the good ones get hired and so they
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
leave without a degree and that it's an
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
important program here it depresses our
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
graduation rate so what we did was look
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
at what were the credits that the
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
welders were likely welding students
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
were likely not to have when they went
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
out on that internship we contacted them
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
we said we're going to offer them at
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
night you know we're gonna probably now
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
we're gonna offer them online because we
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
want you to finish that degree because
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of those welders are going to want
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
to own their own welding companies and
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to want a business degree
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
or at least some business credits along
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
the way and so finding ways to help
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
people Move Along come back you know
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
there all kinds of predictions I'm sure
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
you've seen them that you know it used
 
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
to be oneand done that's those days are
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
gone people are going to be coming back
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
and back and and I think two and foure
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
institutions need to take keep that in
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
mind okay great thank you thank you Rick
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes one yeah one of the one of the
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions that I have is that with the
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
particularly in this state as it relates
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the cost of higher education and I
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
think think a lot of families are
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
looking at what's the ROI what's the
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
return on investment of having my child
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
go to a fouryear school when they might
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
be able to go to a community college
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're interested in
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
let's say computer programming and they
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
can go to a community college and get a
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
Microsoft certificate and leave with
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
that certificate and start at the at the
 
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
$70,000 $80,000 level unlike if my child
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a teacher and went to four
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
years and came out and would start at
 
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.830 align:start position:0%
years and came out and would start at
like

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
35,000 doll yeah so I think the concern
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
that I have is that how do we um
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that there are opportunities for
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
people to have a variety of different
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities to get their education and
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
be successful at it and not be assumed
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
by the need for to go to a fouryear
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
institution is that's the way you have
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
to go yeah and I that's one of the
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
things I've learned and become very
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
respectful of the community college
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
program uh and the opportunity for
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
students who have limited resources or
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
who may have a particular interest that
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
they want to pursu but don't necessarily
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
have to have a quote liberal arts degree
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
I don't even know what a liberal arts
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
degree is going to get you these days
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
but uh any thoughts on that well first
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
of all I majored in English and history
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
so um I used to advise un cited students
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the University of Rhode Island I
 
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
remember one came in I'd like to have a
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
major in English but I don't know what I
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
could do with it and I said I was a dean
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the time I said you can have my job
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay so um I I think um more and more we
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't know where those degrees are going
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
to take people and where their careers
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
are going to go used to be you know one
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
got on a line and stayed on it and that
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that's happening less and less so
 
01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of messages and
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students to keep their
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
options open you this is what you want
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
to do now but you don't know where
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to take you and you you we
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
we've done everything we can and but we
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
need you the student as a partner to
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
keep those options open um get yourself
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
situated right now but think about you
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
know you're probably not going to do
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
that forever
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
so make it so that you can go on and do
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
the next thing and we're there for
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah doctor the the we we've got
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves really in a corner here in the
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
state as well as I think Vermont does
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably more so here in terms of our
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
kids are coming out with very high debt
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
tuition costs are like second highest in
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
the Public's in the
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
country and and we're we're we're seeing
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
our our tuition costs undercut by Orono
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
and by UMass L and out of state uh which
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
they're attracting our students so we we
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
are at a situation where our revenues
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
are declining
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
due to uh this unless we do what Vermont
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
did and start chasing these out of state
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
students but now they've got themselves
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
at the point where uh their Flagship has
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
what 75 80% out of Staters and the
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
remaining are are inate and we
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
definitely don't want that but we're
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
quickly changing I think it used to be
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
pretty like 60% inate 40% out of state
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
now it's almost
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
reversed in New
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we we have this problem how
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
do we compete now with places like
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which are really going
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
after our students there's a limited
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
pool oroa is just dragging them out of
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
this state right now how do we resolve
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
this issue if we don't do a
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
merger uh it's a good question I do
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
think a merger would probably put you in
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
a better position to address it
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
collectively um but but it's a hard
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
problem and it's certainly related to
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
what Joe was talking about um I
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
remember you know I can see um
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
university of main Oro signs I think I
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
saw one over near the other day you know
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um it was a great idea Flagship match
 
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
why not um I think you know one thing to
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
look at is and this kind of relates to
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
some of our other conversation one of
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
the programs that the federal government
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
funds is a work study program and um uh
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
it provide it it's not well enough
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
funded you could talk to your people in
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
Washington about increasing the fun
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
there but the federal government pays I
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
think 80% of what students earn they
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
work on campus some of them work in the
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
community but most of them work on
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
campus and part of what that does is
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
help Bond them to the campus it lets it
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
helps them get to know um some of the
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
people who work at the institution I
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
remember again at the University of
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island it was the people we had a
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
physical education program and the
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
people in the athletic store room some
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the students who were struggling got
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
to know those people who worked in in
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
the store room and they were the adult
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
that they connected with and so looking
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
for ways to you know help the student
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
make that connection with the university
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is probably harder um with online
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
than it is otherwise or with the
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
community college but you know part of
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
the community look for ways to um do
 
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
that I think is
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
important thank you very much do because
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
if they if they're gonna work and they
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
go off campus to work that makes their
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
life harder if you can figure out ways
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
to have more of them working on campus
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
that I think will help
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further uh questions
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
from the Comm we've had Dr brittenham
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
here now for an hour and 15 minutes and
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
and uh I know that we had indicated
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
initially about an hour for her and I
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
hope we're not grilling you too much not
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
at all not at all um are there are there
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee well Dr britam I really
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your um your your
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
presenting to us today and
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
offering us uh so much to think about
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and giving us some advice is where
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
we can go get some of these answers are
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
are there is there anything in summary
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
you'd like to say to the committee uh
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
before we move on here I think New
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is fortunate to have uh you
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
all working on this problem and thinking
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
about it you've got good expertise that
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
you've thrown into the conversation and
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
a good commitment and you uh understand
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
how difficult this is um I appreciate
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be with you I'm going
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
again okay for the committee right now
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
what we ought to do is
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
that take about a five or 10 minute
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
break and then uh come back and then uh
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh discuss where we're going to go uh on
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
trying to put together some you know
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
some considerations here I did have a
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
chance to talk with uh uh represent
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
umberger in division two this
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
morning and um she's indicating that
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are um they're looking at possibly
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
saying slow down uh on on this process
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and and working with the the systems
 
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
in trying to develop some process to do
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
that I also offered tour her the RSA
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we have the higher education study
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
committee already on the books that
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
should be engaged at at this time on
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
this topic and and she she uh uh
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
listened and wrote down
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
187-a uh call
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
28 so um I think they're they're very
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
much aware uh and as she alluded to me
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
today it things are changing by the hour
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know how to address this
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
um within Finance so um I I don't think
 
01:17:58.990 --> 01:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
they come up with any recommendations
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
yet it hasn't gone to the whole finance
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
committee but she has to have her report
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
ready to go next week so we are going to
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
have to come up with something this
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon whether we incorporate the the
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
the sheet that you and and uh Mel you
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
and Dave put together and of course I
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
put together a sheet also uh I think
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of duplicity between the
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
two there is uh and uh so what I'd like
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
to do is just take a short break and
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
then um come back here discuss that a
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
little bit and then we're GNA probably
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
have to break for a lunch and and then
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
come back and work a little bit
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
here you want to break till 11:30
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
Rick yeah yeah we'll break for 11:30 and
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back and discuss our our
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
our route we're going to take the path
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to take here then we'll
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
probably have another break for lunch
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then and then return so let's come
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
back at 11:30 everybody hit the
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
refrigerator for a second or two all
 
01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%

yep well folks
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard now from Dr McKay and
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard um uh then from the Dr Don
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
Burks and Susan Huard Joe Moran and
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
Katherine F Venture and today
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
from um Dr
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
brittenham and we've been very fortunate
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
to have some very experienced
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
professionals provided advice now I I
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're at the position
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
where we have to issue some kind of a
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
brief to the division two and talking
 
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
brief to the division two and talking
with

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh Karen umberger uh representative
 
01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.430 align:start position:0%
uh uh Karen umberger uh representative
umberger

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh she she needs she does need that
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
right off immediately seeing that
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're moving forward and
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
they've got to make a recommendation so
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think our policy input is is
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
necessary and critical to this process
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I I would U then suggest that we
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh take the remaining part of the time
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
which we're going to have today and I
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's starting from this point
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
forward and and looking at um what we've
 
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.629 align:start position:0%
forward and and looking at um what we've
heard

01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
and in the reports that we've got
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
several draft uh suggestions here in
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
front of us uh maybe what we ought to do
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
is Wade through this um line you know
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue by issue and resolve is you know
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
is this a element that we need to put
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
forward to division two for their
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
consideration um uh let's just have an
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
open discussion right now and and folks
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would like to you know before we
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
get into to it are there any other
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions as to a direction that we
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
might want to uh consider um
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh Rick just a
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
question to you I think which is have
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
you have you thought about format I mean
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
how how this thing might what this thing
 
01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
might look like and sending it over or
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about that I mean I you
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
might have some thoughts about how to do
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I'd love to have a format
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is more TR
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
as we've done for so many commissions
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
and reports when we send it back to
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
either the speaker or the president of
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
the senate or to the state librarian Etc
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
however we just don't have that time
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
today to to go through that and involve
 
01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
today to to go through that and involve
our

01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
researcher um to uh provide us you know
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
some review or a summary reports of what
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
we have have heard in testimony we
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
definitely should be uh in our report
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
including the names of those who
 
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
testified and the sources of information
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we received that should be an
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
addendum to the report um but uh I I
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
think that our you know the we would
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
start off the report I would assume with
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
our task and our task I think can to be
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
defined in a couple quick quick
 
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
sentences much like that you know I had
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know as the purpose of this uh
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee when we started and it
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
reads to to consider and identify
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
relevant information per pertaining to
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire college and university
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
a system as proposed in hb2 uh pursuant
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
to you know in the chapter of of
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
law uh then we go down we start listing
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
some of the the the facts that we've
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
identified represent Miler yeah I think
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
I think one of the I think both the U
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
the questions that David and I uh put
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
together yesterday and your questions
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
Rick I think there's a lot of similarity
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
there I think the threshold question for
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
me is what we've heard from our various
 
01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.070 align:start position:0%
me is what we've heard from our various
input

01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
individuals is whether or not through
 
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
the budget as currently
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
proposed this merger should take
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
place and I think um based upon your
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.189 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative
umberger

01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
and frankly my concern is that there are
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of complex issues here of which
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
we've identified in those
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be dealt
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
with uh prior to moving forward with the
 
01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.109 align:start position:0%
with uh prior to moving forward with the
budget

01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
proposal that division two is currently
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
considering uh and that's why I think at
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
least in in the notes that I sent to you
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
ear yesterday
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon the up to the formation of
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
some kind kind of a group a
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative group that can do some of
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
this planning and some of this answering
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
questions prior
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
to um moving forward uh with a with a
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
merger should that be the recommendation
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the final study and I just I just
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
think this is such a an important issue
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
I I recognize and I understand and I
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
feel the
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
urgency and I that was very impactful on
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
me yesterday but on the other hand I I
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
just I just think there there is a need
 
01:34:31.629 --> 01:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
to slow this down to look at it with a
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
time frame of coming up with with a
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion so I don't see this going on
 
01:34:36.119 --> 01:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
conclusion so I don't see this going on
odd

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
odd
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
infinitum but I think that what we have
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
what I have sensed in the data we've
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
gathered here is that there are a
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of issues that need to
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
be at least looked at prior to trying to
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
create this entity
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
that would bring these campuses all
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
together into one system so that so I
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a threshold question Rick
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think do we
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
conclude that some time needs to take
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
place to do with these questions rather
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
than moving forward uh with it in the
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
budget I think that's a fundamental
 
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
question for this group to deal with as
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
we uh make some recommendations or some
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
raise some issues with the uh division
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
two well I I in response that um I think
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
we can all concur that the process needs
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
to slow
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
down um now issues associated with the
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
budget we do have division two and
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
finance which are going to have to make
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the decision regarding budget whether
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
that moves forward I I we were tasked to
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
try to provide the information that we
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
can locate and discover that either
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
either you know the supports both ways
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I think we just got to be uh
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
providing that information so I do not
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to say U uh and present the the the
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
U the the position that uh we either
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
support or don't support the merger I I
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that we can't do that seeing
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
that obviously we haven't had a thorough
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
enough discussion on that uh there are a
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other people that have provided
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
us email corresponden uh I just saw
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
something that came in from Steve
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg um regarding his perceptions
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
and understandings of how this might you
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
know impact um Career Technical
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
education uh issues as associated with
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
the community college system and as he
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
he as a u a trustee or a board member in
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
system and there are others as well
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not totally 100% familiar
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
with some of the financial issues that
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know Finance is going to have to
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
deal with in terms of you know the
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenses of the community
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
college system I do know though that uh
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're at critical mass in turn in
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
terms of there is no margin anymore for
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know making this come out even we're
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
not coming out even with operating our
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
our postsecondary education
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
institutions um and that's something
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
that going to have to be decided by
 
01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:27.159 align:start position:0%
division two and by so you're you're
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting basically that the the
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions or the issues that that we've
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
posed in the questions that on on both
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
that have been submitted to this
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we basically say here
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
are the questions that we came up with
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
forward that to the division two and
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
then based upon uh the the questions
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
that we're putting forward let them make
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
they've got to make that decision
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately what to do with the but is
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying well I'm I'm
 
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say that I believe we have two
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
very very strong Educational Systems for
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Ed the community college
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
system and the university system are
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
very effective in fact we we're putting
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
out students which have skills which
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
come out with degrees which are valued
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
and and we've been successful we want to
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
see that Contin so the bottom line is I
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
do not want to you
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to destroy all the
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
good things that we've done and say well
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
no we gotta just jump ship and do
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
something else here uh we want to better
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
our system and all the considerations
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and questions that we have listed you
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking
 
01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
at one I have yes there's duplicity but
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
there's 43 considerations and questions
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
there and the one that I received from
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh you were you know there's another 26
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
there some are are similar but all that
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to resolve those in one
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
quick uh period of time there we all
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
recognize it's going to be an extended
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
time frame to really put this place in
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
effect and make sure we're doing what
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
our that objective is that goal is but
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of issues associated
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
with reaching a university system that
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
is one um
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
and to do that um we need to have all
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
these issues looked at thoroughly and I
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
believe that by slowing down in the next
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
year these questions these
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
considerations should be given to that
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
group and that and and and listening to
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
what Dr britam just said we want to have
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
folks there that have the content and
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the understandings and the fiduciary
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
respon possibilities and understandings
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
to make some of these decisions um so I
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we we if we're going
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
to recommend anything that we slow down
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
we offer these considerations and
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions but we also suggest that a
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
coordinating Council of some type be
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
developed to address these issues and
 
01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.310 align:start position:0%
developed to address these issues and
these

01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
considerations um uh and then leaving
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
the decision what to do with hb2 to
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
finance people and we'll obviously have
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
a opportunity on the house floor to you
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
know address things there but I we do
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
need to have our questions and
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
considerations addressed and so I would
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
say a coordinating Council made up of
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
people that come from both systems and
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
maybe as Dr britam said you may want to
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
have three other people are so in there
 
01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
which have expertise to work with that
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
Council this way it wouldn't be a
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
commission where you have to get
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
something through legislation right it
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
be a recommendation that it be picked up
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
right now and start
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
working yeah Dave yeah so Rick I I um I
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely concur with u with with I
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
think what what what appears to be um
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
you know consensus on the um on the slow
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
it down um a bit uh I I think in in use
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
in taking um Dr brittingham's word slow
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
it down get it right there's some
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
cautionary tales out there I think we
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
saw that in the enms um report as well
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
right um and and so I think that's an
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
important um uh piece of this I um I and
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
I I think we're we're probably talking
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
about the same thing but but um but I
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
think we got to work out you know what
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
sort of details we might want to
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
recommend in terms of whether it's a
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
council or a merger commission or or
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
whatever that goes in and and um you
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
know is is is charged with with with
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
certain tasks and maybe goes after that
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
that group of 50 questions that that are
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
on you know your sheet and Mel's um you
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
know sheet from from from yesterday and
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they'll come up with more
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
more things too but um but I I I guess
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know we we we had a we had a really
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
good conversation with Dr brittingham
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
about um about the trustees and about a
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
um you know whether it's a councel or
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission or or something like that and
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
um and it it wasn't clear to me as to
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not I mean when she's talking
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
about the trustees who are the two
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
boards that are currently in place to
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
manage the university system not man AG
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
but but oversee the university system
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
oversee the community college system
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that have the fiduciary
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um a new a new
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
unified um um Board of Trustees I think
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
she was talking about having obviously
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibilities but that
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be sort of a post merger type of
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
thing in a in a in a council or or a
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
commission to look into the merger I
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we're talking about fiducial
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um U at this point I
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about people that
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
have it doesn't necessarily have to be
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature but but
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
people like like you know us that have
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
that have been interested in this area
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
but also other you know um members of
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
the public um possibly members of of the
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the system boards um um but but
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
certainly you know the most important
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
thing is who we hear from who that
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
commission or that Council would be
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
hearing from yeah I I Dave I I concur
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to have people on there
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
that have some definitely have the
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the understandings of what
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
what this whole uh bill is about there
 
01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:13.639 align:start position:0%
are folks such as for example Dr Burks
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
who who testified and and and who has uh
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
experienced um you mergers and worked in
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
different systems and is uh bringing
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
Innovation to the the institution which
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
he's in charge of um I think that taking
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
that type of individual and putting them
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
onto a council um and uh I I feel also
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
that this is something which is I don't
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
want to get down and start micromanaging
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
something which I don't really have all
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
the policies and all the
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
consideration but for the people that
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
are living it and breathing it and
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
managing it I think it's
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility that should be put back
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
on those folks and I Rely heavily on the
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
Joe morans of the world or the Catherine
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
provines or the Susan hu's of the world
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and and have them come
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
out with a working Council to structure
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
this but I also feel that there should
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
be some kind of uh if you're looking at
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
a flight path from here to there where
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
we want to be there's going to be
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
benchmarks along the way yeah reporting
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
periods where there's performance
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
measures which there has to be a report
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
back to the legislative oversight or
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
study educate you know some committee
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to ensure that there's um
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
communication going on with the
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
legislature that is what we are
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for under
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
187a and and um I think that we need to
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
really have that
 
01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.310 align:start position:0%
really have that
communication

01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
right um ju just to clarify Rick um I I
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
I agree with all of that um and I think
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the same thing that
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
this coordinating council is not a an
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
oversight Council it's not a
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary doesn't fiduciary
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to either system it's
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's clearly just an it's an it's a
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.910 align:start position:0%
it's clearly just an it's an it's a
investigation

01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's doing what we have been trying to
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
do and and uh and and finalizing it and
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
giving some sense of direction of of
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
timeline of of uh uh how we're going to
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
be handling all these issues that we've
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
addressed yeah I think I think the one
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
thing that that Dr britam said this
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
morning that I thought was good is is to
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
assess what is but more important what
 
01:46:51.159 --> 01:46:52.109 align:start position:0%
assess what is but more important what
could

01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
be and it's that it's that future issue
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
yeah with with a foundation of what is
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
that I think that a combination of that
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
conversation that that I get can get
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
excited about about the future
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
so I I see that uh representative moffs
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
had his hand up
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.070 align:start position:0%
had his hand up
politely

01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
politely
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
excuse uh real quick been mentioned a
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
couple times we have duplicity I think
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
we mean duplication
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
no duplicity around here right so
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
anyway Dave may have been TR with Dave
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
became on the board at NTI but 1995
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
Governor Merill uh asked the Comm or at
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
the time was the technical col system to
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
completely restructure and president's
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
were L very painful uh some good came
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
from that I think there was some some
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
savings that were identified by
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
necessity but very painful I think there
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
might be some lessons uh we could
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
hearken back to from 199 95 good and bad
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
um other college experiences I mean
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine Connecticut on and on uh
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
we've already looked at some of their
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
issues of course we're unique but I
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
think there are some common rer issues
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
that we can uh identify and look at and
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
apply to our
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
situation um one one quick question one
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
more comment um executive Council
 
01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
approval is that would the chancellor be
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
subject to EC approval at some point or
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
not you know you're asking a question uh
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
Mike that I can't answer you on that
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just it just occurred to me my
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
my last uh quick comment is just
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
procedural um in terms of what we do
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
next uh I have all kinds of notes I know
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
you all do as well um if there was some
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a working document that that uh
 
01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
we once uh Rea Jennifer whoever get
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
something started to put together uh for
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to see that working
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
document and then respond to that might
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
be useful when what is Karen's deadline
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
R when when do you need to submit
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
something the the the deadline that
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
Karen told me this morning for this
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon so so Rick yeah Al along those
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
lines and and I think what what what
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
Mike's talking about is real important
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
here and you started out talking about
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
the um uh the sort of the framing up
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
this document with with who we've heard
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
from I think that's you know summarizing
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
who we've heard from extract from that
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
findings and then develop from that a a
 
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.709 align:start position:0%
findings and then develop from that a a
recom

01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
recom
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that's correct yeah
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
yeah also we can also use remarks which
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
have you know if we've received written
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
you know information we should be we
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
should be looking at everything we can
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh because we're actually not
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
trying to take a position we're just
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
trying to provide a brief which has
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
these identified
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
considerations that we're hoping that
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
will be listened to and taken into
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
hb2 Mr chairman yeah uh I'm wondering if
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
a starting point might be in the AGB
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
form that says suggest and
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations for Governors and
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
legislators because it starts off with a
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
send a clear signal that Merit comes
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
first in recruiting screening appointing
 
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
public highered governing board
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
members I mean that kind of a thing at
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
least they they take they set a very
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
high bar in all that I realize that but
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
I think at least that they lay out
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
personal experience professional
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
experience commitment and that's an
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
important part of it I mean you're
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
asking a lot of people well the
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
governance of how this all works is is
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
is huge and well beyond our domain right
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
now yeah uh it's it's just like the
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
question I posed to Katherine this
 
01:51:08.430 --> 01:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
morning you're going to have the the
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
this new board and then underneath that
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
new board and reporting that board will
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
Chancellor and then you're going to have
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
the college presidents under neath the
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
chancellor now the question I had though
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
are are the the the president's going to
 
01:51:26.719 --> 01:51:28.069 align:start position:0%
are are the the the president's going to
report

01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
to some other structure or is the
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
chancellor going to have the
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
authority is the chancellor going to
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
have the authority to and even the time
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
or the capability to evaluate and and
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
and get on top of all 11 institutional
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
leaders or do we need a vice chair and
 
01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
and during some kind kind of a
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
transitional mode here does the vice
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
chair then have more uh association with
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the community college system and
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
that can also then be the one that may
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh assess the institutional presidents
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and have those reporting and then
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
the vice chair reports to the chair or
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
Chancellor um there's going to have to
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
be a whole new arrangement of
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
administration in that office the
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
Chancellor's office um that's to be
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
decided I think that's where this this
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
coordinating Council exactly exactly
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
into play we can't make that
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
determination we don't have it no yeah
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
no I agree with what you're saying about
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
that though I do think that having a CEO
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
is absolutely essential I've been in
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
that position several times from below
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
that and mid management gets absolutely
 
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
crushed that whole process if you don't
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a boss who can say Okay break apart
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing this somebody has to be able
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
to make a decision and if they they
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
can't make that decision or they're
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
precluded we can have Vice chancellors
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever that that's all just a
 
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism for making it work but
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to be in charge yeah
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's to be discussed and you
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
know because we we were we're living
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
right now with two systems that have
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
worked but they're totally different
 
01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.470 align:start position:0%
worked but they're totally different
system

01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of who makes those decisions
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
and who reports to whom so what I'd like
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
to do if we
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
can is um art wants to Art wants to say
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
something I think oh there's okay yes
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
art your hands up just quickly I I I
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
like the idea of framing sort of what
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to put together in terms of
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations seems to me
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
that that that helps to focus on the
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
message whatever it is that we want to
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
send but I think both of those findings
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
and recommendations make a whole lot of
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
sense well yeah but we're gota be very
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
careful how we word that word
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay right yeah so
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
because that was not what we're T to do
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to provide the
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
information the considerations those
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
elements that need more Resolve
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
right so yeah we we can we can identify
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
our our our source
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
and what we've found and what we've
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
heard um and and like you know just just
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
like today with Dr britam there is a lot
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
of good stuff that came from Dr
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
brittenham uh from that we're going to
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
then develop questions considerations
 
01:54:40.589 --> 01:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
and that's what we got to do so I think
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
that what we need to do is yes we will
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
summarize the reports of the various
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
individuals reported yes but then below
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
that we've got to write down this
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
section that um well it's partially been
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
tackled by uh Dave and Mill and myself
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
with those report we need to walk
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
through those and just walk through them
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
and say okay that's that's a good
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
element that has to be put in here or
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's or it's already identified in that
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
other element uh so that's where I think
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
we got to spend our time it'll take you
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
know some time to go through these
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
discussions and uh I would suggest that
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
we take a a quick break for a lunch then
 
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
come back and work on this and take you
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
know we we mentioned earlier we could be
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
going to 2 o'clock with these sheets in
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
front of us we may be able to get down
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
through some of those sheets and say um
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know and get it down quickly I'm
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
saying by two o'clock three o'clock and
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
and then having that as a report that's
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
ready to go forward to Karen so so what
 
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is is uh and and Jen
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
can put this together from a standpoint
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
of who we talked with that's that's who
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
are our Consultants that we dealt with
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and then and we we have that as the
 
01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
first part then when we come back after
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
lunch we can go through the questions I
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
think both the qu question sheets are
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
very similar I think your your issues
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
are a little more detailed than the
 
01:56:12.669 --> 01:56:12.679 align:start position:0%
questions that we came up with but then
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
identify are these the questions that we
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
have are there others that we need to
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
add yes and then from that that's what
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
then is submitted uh to uh division two
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's it I wonder if it's a
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
good idea to attach any of these other
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
pre-developed ones like the one in in
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
the AGB and other organizations and just
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
reference them yes as sources that that
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
will occur Oliver what we will do is
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
that when we have the summary of the
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who spoke then we're going
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
to have all the materials that they you
 
01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
know and an addendum with all those
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
materials that have been submitted and
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
for those that didn't present there's
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
other materials which we have we can
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
send a full
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
package okay and so it'll all be
 
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
there I got I gotta jump for a a 12
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock but I'll be back at one okay
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine is
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
um H okay uh anybody else have to be is
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
everybody going to be back and available
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
at 1 or 12:30 I if if Dave's going to be
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
gone um 12:30 works for me if you want
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
to get some stuff done till Dave gets
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
back is that okay with everybody else I
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
think that be
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
here I don't think it'll hurt to start
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
12:30 and then Dave can cut in on it uh
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
so let's let's take a break right now
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
Jen and we will come back and open this
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee back up at

12:30 all right
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
Jen I am just had to get to my mute
 
01:58:05.709 --> 01:58:05.719 align:start position:0%
button okay we're gonna take a break
 
01:58:05.719 --> 01:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
button okay we're gonna take a break
till

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
till
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
12:30 um what we also you You Have you
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
listened to all our conversations we've
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
had yes and I'm I'm starting on a draft
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
for you yeah and when you're talking
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
about the individuals who spoke if you
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
can just you know not everything they
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
said just a an overview a summary of
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
what they have proposed and and
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
discussed okay so because it can't be
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
too lengthy uh seeing that this has to
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
get out to division two today yeah um do
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
you w to do you want to summarize it it
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
seems like almost everyone gave us kind
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
of a brief um talking points we could
 
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
just attach those that might be well I
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
think what we will do is Summarize each
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
one of those persons for example like
 
01:58:55.709 --> 01:58:55.719 align:start position:0%
you know today uh what we had spoken by
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
Dr Barbara brittenham was issues a so
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
and I took some notes here um maybe when
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
we come back at 12:30 we could give you
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
some you want like two or three
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
sentences about where they're coming
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
from for this report because then we can
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
also list below barbar's name how she
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
can be contacted you know you know so
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
that we have that reference and and to
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
for the committee so for example if
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative umberger had a question
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
it would be easy to call us or call her
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
directly okay yeah um I could also you
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
know I could put together maybe like a

contact list for her that that's right
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
news boys a week after I had my
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
shot I broke out into a fullbody rash no
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
don't now now now for me for me that's a
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
good s sign because it says that my
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
compromise to immune system is reacting
 
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly so it was good I mean it
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't wasn't itchy or anything but it
 
02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:26.269 align:start position:0%
wasn't wasn't itchy or anything but it
was

02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
just one one of us one day it was just
 
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
bang just like that it was there and it
 
02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:32.910 align:start position:0%
bang just like that it was there and it
lasted

02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
lasted
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
for I think about about 10 days I don't
 
02:29:40.830 --> 02:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
want to hear about that well believe me
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's just uh it's it wasn't it wasn't
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
inconvenient wasn't painful it was just
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
wow what's this
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't know but it it's it's it's
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
hurting yeah I skip my morning push-ups
 
02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
today okay hey guys we got to go ahead
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and start here because we are limited
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
with time I spoke with Jen four here
 
02:30:08.269 --> 02:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
over the period of the break and she's
 
02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
working on the top part of the form that
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
the traditional form we use in in in
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
reporting uh uh committee commission
 
02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
type work
 
02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
um but what we're going to do
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
now is uh go down through the
 
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
considerations and questions that we've
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
have um and and and go line by line and
 
02:30:31.269 --> 02:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
see if that's okay and and incorporate
 
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
that into the report uh Jennifer has an
 
02:30:37.269 --> 02:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
appointment at 2:30 today but there's
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
another person available up there in
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
research that can help us so let's try
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
to you know stick with Jen and and try
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
to you know see if we get down through
 
02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
these Pages here with these
 
02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
considerations and remember just and
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
what she can do is she can modify them
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
because if they're not grammatically
 
02:30:59.389 --> 02:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
correct or something like that but um uh
 
02:31:02.429 --> 02:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
so let's let's start working on that um
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
does everybody have in front of
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
them or on their screen the two reports
 
02:31:13.469 --> 02:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
at yeah I would suggest Rick that we go
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
through your list first because I think
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's a little more it's more
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than just a question okay
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
either way because we yeah we can do
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
that and then we can go down the other
 
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
list too because I want to be fair and
 
02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
honest and and get down through
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
everything and incorporate in if we're
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
missing something yeah all right so the
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
the the list we're looking at then is
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
the one that has on the top of it says
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
education subcommittee Representatives
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah lists our
 
02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
names and and then the first
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
item uh on that underneath
 
02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
considerations questions number one um I
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
took that from another report that's
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
more of a a nationwide I don't know if
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is estimated that 25% of colleges
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
could go out of business in the next few
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
years we know that it's going to happen
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
we were just told by uh Barbara
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
brittenham that um that's probably a lot
 
02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:14.269 align:start position:0%
brittenham that um that's probably a lot
of

02:32:14.269 --> 02:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
privates um
 
02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
um so in the second part can New
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's small fouryear school
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
survive without becoming part of the New
 
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire postsecondary system including
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
certificate two-year degree and
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
four-year degree offerings economy and
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
scale I don't know if we need that one
 
02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:32.910 align:start position:0%
scale I don't know if we need that one
there

02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
um it I I'd just like to have up or down
 
02:32:40.190 --> 02:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of I go with it I go with the
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
way you have it rick okay let's let's
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
just leave number one
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
in go to number two then is a New
 
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire student benefiting financially
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
or losing faith in attending a New
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire postsecondary institution in
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
which he or she runs up unaffordable
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
debt and who has has an almost one in
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
two chance he or she would not graduate
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with the debt issue yep
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
good okay anybody oppositional there
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's Nationwide d da number three from
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
2001 to 2021 postsecondary tuition Rose
 
02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:22.590 align:start position:0%
2001 to 2021 postsecondary tuition Rose
over

02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
140% UNH has the second highest tuition
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
rate among public
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
to just just go ahead art we we don't
 
02:33:36.190 --> 02:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
need to recognize this is a a work
 
02:33:38.429 --> 02:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
session thanks I I I think that the
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue about the high second highest
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
tuition rate's got to be in there
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere yeah the the um and I think uh
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
along with that deals with the question
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
that britam raised this morning is how
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
are you going to get more New Hampshire
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
students to attend New Hampshire higher
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
education that's I think what you just
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
said needs to be added in there yeah H
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
how how are we going to get more kids to
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
attend when it's so high exactly and I
 
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
think that I think I would add that as a
 
02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
second part of of number three as a
 
02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:17.790 align:start position:0%
second part of of number three as a
question

02:34:17.790 --> 02:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:19.389 align:start position:0%
question
uh

02:34:19.389 --> 02:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
Jen yep I think Jen should be in part of
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
this conversation too she shouldn't be
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
muted yeah you know she I don't think
 
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
she is muted but she's there there you
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
are good okaycome make a suggestion like
 
02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
that can you just pencil in yep I don't
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
think I caught the full question could
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
you we're on the the the yeah number
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
three and what we're looking at is UNH
 
02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
has the second highest tuition rate
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
among public
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
universities the next question Mel would
 
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
you read how you phrase that I would
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
just say how how are we going to attract
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire students to New
 
02:35:02.399 --> 02:35:03.710 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire students to New
Hampshire

02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
colleges with such high tuition
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
rates so that would be that there' be
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
two sentences in that you don't
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily need that 2001 to 2020
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
postsecondary tuition R over although we
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
could raise that because that's no I
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that's important I think that's
 
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
important yeah okay so we'll just add
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
that one sentence on the back side of
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
number three let's go to number four how
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
does the state anticipate improving
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
existing credit transfer ability among
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
institutions given that program
 
02:35:38.110 --> 02:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
accreditations happens at the individual
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
department or program level
 
02:35:44.710 --> 02:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
levels that's a question it's a question
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate I think so yeah yeah this
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
came from the alliance yeah it was in
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
their report okay absolutely okay number
 
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
their report okay absolutely okay number
five

02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
then uh hb2 overhauls postsecondary
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
governance within that organizational
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
structure what is the specific role of
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
the chancellor do presidents report to
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the chancellor or the board does the
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
chancellor evaluate
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
president pres a president president's
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
performance does the board hire and fire
 
02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
presidents have job descriptions been
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
defined Beyond broad statements made in
 
02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 page 52 lines 6 through
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
13 yeah they're all good questions I
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
think yeah oh yeah very good yeah flag
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
this a number of times and I we're not
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
looking to make recommendations um but
 
02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
we did identify the problem or the
 
02:36:48.269 --> 02:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
difference disparity between ccsnh with
 
02:36:48.279 --> 02:36:49.429 align:start position:0%
difference disparity between ccsnh with
the

02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
chancellor uh with the president's
 
02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
answer to the CH Chancellor and usn when
 
02:36:57.070 --> 02:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
it's not the same way so you've
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
identified that as a dichotomy or
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
whatever uh but we don't I we don't want
 
02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
to make any recommendation or or doing
 
02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
well I think you're right in stating the
 
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
fact yeah that there's a difference way
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
of doing it in the two systems you know
 
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
the Community College um
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
oversees those
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
presidents yeah it would be interesting
 
02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
not not for this group but I I'm
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
interested to see how did that current
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
usnh system evolve with a weak
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
Chancellor and the presidents I just I
 
02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
have no I don't know the answer to that
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
but it been interesting to find out why
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
it was developed that way Dr Ed McKay
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
has that answer because I don't think it
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
was always like that okay and he in I my
 
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
discussions with in the past he's
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
explained it and I I just don't want to
 
02:37:51.309 --> 02:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
you know yeah yeah shoot from my hip on
 
02:37:55.150 --> 02:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
it yeah so then on the back side of that
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
number five then do we want to indicate
 
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
something to the fact that uh the role
 
02:38:02.110 --> 02:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
of the chancellor at the
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
two current systems is
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
different that should be St that should
 
02:38:13.870 --> 02:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
be stated yeah yeah so you got that
 
02:38:18.269 --> 02:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
Jen I do thank you very much number
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
six is there an established set of
 
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
Benchmark performance measures to assess
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
progress toward a successful merger
 
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
outcome parenthesis performance
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
benchmarks along the flight path to
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
achieving the desired outcome um is what
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
I was trying to say there is that
 
02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
there's a governance outcome we're
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
looking for and that would be to have
 
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
the singular form of government
 
02:38:46.269 --> 02:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
governance but then there's all these
 
02:38:47.950 --> 02:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
other policy
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
statements uh and and considerations
 
02:38:53.950 --> 02:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
that must be looked at um I don't know
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
if we need that in parenthesis or not
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
but somewhere along the way if we're
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to recom and maybe this should be
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
taken out and if we have something down
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
below where we're going to say something
 
02:39:10.269 --> 02:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
about a a a a council or an organization
 
02:39:14.269 --> 02:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
to look at um uh what we talked about
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
there in the next next year maybe that
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be flowing down there with that
 
02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with you on that Rick I
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't think the parenthetic note is
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
needed yeah okay I agree is that is that
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
where you want to also talk about the
 
02:39:29.269 --> 02:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
differences in the mission with the
 
02:39:29.279 --> 02:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
differences in the mission with the
community

02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
colleges I I think he addresses that a
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
little bit later Oliver okay yeah I
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
can't recall what this was put together
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
they make a big point in all of theirs
 
02:39:44.349 --> 02:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
about having different missions yeah and
 
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
so I think we ought to be sensitive to
 
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
that let's let's flag that because I
 
02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
think that you're absolutely right that
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
needs to be in there but I think he does
 
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
cover that later
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay lad you want to end at successful
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
merger outcome for number six is that
 
02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes
 
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes so then we just go on number seven
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
here read this the the community college
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
system has an established educational
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
program to provide training and
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
education and skills essential to local
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
and Regional business will merger with a
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
four-year system overshadow the mission
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the current two-year and certificate
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh certificate Pathways offered by the
 
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
community college
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
system I think that's one of our real
 
02:40:30.670 --> 02:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
yeah questions you might throw badges in
 
02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:32.429 align:start position:0%
yeah questions you might throw badges in
that

02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
too okay uh um
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
um what what does that what does that
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
mean all ruins is badges it's kind of
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
like a merit badge is the only thing I
 
02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
can come up with I think it in terms of
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
Scouts but that's what basically what it
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
is it says you've learned this little
 
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
specialized skill okay maybe it's a big
 
02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
specialized skill but that's what it is
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a performance recognition
 
02:41:00.190 --> 02:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
then yes yes it says that you're
 
02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
qualified in well somebody's program
 
02:41:05.950 --> 02:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it is all right okay so we
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
could put badges you know comma Badges
 
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
and then and and have that we've had the
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
discussion the education committee
 
02:41:16.510 --> 02:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
regarding badges in the past and in New
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here we we never put it into
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know anything
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
because it was it was defined so
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
differently by everybody right yeah okay
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
then number eight number eight
 
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
affordability uh will the affordable
 
02:41:38.910 --> 02:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
cost tuition at Community College remain
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
affordable or reflect increased costs
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
due to systemwide revenue
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:47.870 align:start position:0%
due to systemwide revenue
needs

02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
good question just need to put a
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
question mark at the end of that oh yeah
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I see that
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so any problems with number eight
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
no okay uh number nine would the new
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and appointment
 
02:42:06.269 --> 02:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
process be in
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
be in alignment I guess except in in
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
line accepted by the New England
 
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I I don't know if I that's written
 
02:42:20.269 --> 02:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
properly at
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
all I'd just take out
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
in well I don't know if it's you try to
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
ask me I took this out of one of the
 
02:42:32.429 --> 02:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
reports that came to us I think it was
 
02:42:32.439 --> 02:42:33.190 align:start position:0%
reports that came to us I think it was
the

02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
alliance um but uh there's a question of
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
and I to asked this question earlier
 
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
today accreditation even in public K
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
through 12
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendent's office can be
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
accredited as an administrative office
 
02:42:55.150 --> 02:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
um but in in postsecondary education and
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know this Oliver is the the
 
02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
governance the the Chancellor's area
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
Administration do they get accredited or
 
02:43:06.110 --> 02:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
is it just program and departments they
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
haven't in the past but these are
 
02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
changing I had a letter into Barbara and
 
02:43:12.670 --> 02:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get a chance to check my mail
 
02:43:15.309 --> 02:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
yet see if she answered me but I was
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
asking exactly about that departmental
 
02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
accreditation question yeah because I
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't really understand it I I don't
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
think number nine is needed in this
 
02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
think number nine is needed in this
right

02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
now well this does go to the question
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
that Oliver raised earlier this morning
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
regarding not necessarily the uh New
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
England higher education but the other
 
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
one that we had oh
 
02:43:44.590 --> 02:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I think I think there is
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
some relevance from a standpoint
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
particularly what Barbara was talking
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
about is making sure who's on the
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
trustees and what are the standards that
 
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
they bring to the committee that they
 
02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
just aren't political appointees but
 
02:43:59.550 --> 02:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
they bring with them some of their
 
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
experience Etc so I do think that that
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
the concept of an outside agency looking
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
at what those standards would be I think
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
there is relevance there Rick so I think
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
that is true as far as trustees yes yeah
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
so should we re we like would the new
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees in appointment process
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh be accepted by the New England higher
 
02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
education Comm commission accrediting
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
standards yeah just take that align crap
 
02:44:29.110 --> 02:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
out yeah just just you to have it
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
consistent yeah okay okay yeah be
 
02:44:41.469 --> 02:44:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
good okay number 10 will the proposed
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
governance structure expand and simplify
 
02:44:50.190 --> 02:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
or transfer articulation agreements
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.309 --> 02:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
institutions good I think there two
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
questions in that because there are a
 
02:44:59.309 --> 02:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
lot of those that already exist and we
 
02:45:01.469 --> 02:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
don't know about all of them so I think
 
02:45:04.830 --> 02:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have to say existing and perhaps new
 
02:45:09.469 --> 02:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
that okay will the proposed governance
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
simplify so how would you word that uh
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
because it says proposed does that mean
 
02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
new well it just means that it's just
 
02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
proposed it hadn't been agreed to yet
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so take the word proposed out
 
02:45:36.349 --> 02:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
and put new yeah I think that's worth
 
02:45:39.469 --> 02:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
leaving a little freedom in it
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay any objection no no okay number 11
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
what are the estimated cost savings and
 
02:45:50.670 --> 02:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that should be expected
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
from this merger that's on the end if
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
any pardon me
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
everybody that's that's aund million
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
doll question right there that's well
 
02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
you might want to put a comma if any at
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.710 --> 02:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
it yeah uh right well do that question
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's the question Karen once answered
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't I don't have a good
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
answer but uh it's a good question okay
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
I like the idea let's put comma if any
 
02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
in there thanks good suggestion well and
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
that and and Oliver is right I mean
 
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's been a consistent question that
 
02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
has been raised by people we' talked
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
with that's right and nobody will give
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
you a guarantee no that's right did did
 
02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch's oped uh site any uh
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
numbers remember he was all for
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
this and I think part of the rash I
 
02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me but when I
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
saw Governor Lynch former Governor Lynch
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
was all for this you know I got my
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
attention and I think he I think savings
 
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
was part of his
 
02:46:59.070 --> 02:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
argument uh I don't know if he had a
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
number in there but I think that's been
 
02:47:04.349 --> 02:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
a consistent um position of those
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
advocating for moving to this
 
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
immediately so
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let's go on to page 12 here
 
02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let's go on to page 12 here
guys

02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
guys
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
gals um number 12 with a strong CEO I.E
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
the chancellor is it likely that the
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
coordination alignment across
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
institutions will occur more rapidly
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
than within the current two
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
systems yeah good question yeah and I I
 
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
would put I would put the chancellor in
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
parentheses after CEO I would too yeah
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
mean even princes are question mark
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
princes I think if there's unified
 
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
structure unified command structure that
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
plus spoken like a true military
 
02:48:00.750 --> 02:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
it number
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
13 uh will becoming part of a larger
 
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
system negatively impact the flexibility
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the community college system to
 
02:48:12.269 --> 02:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
respond to student and Workforce demands
 
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's one of the big
 
02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:16.230 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's one of the big
questions

02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
yeah okay number 14 mergers must be part
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
of a larger strategic plan and not an
 
02:48:25.870 --> 02:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
isolated endpoint is the cost goal
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
savings significantly different from the
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
current postsecondary
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
system kind of convoluted a little bit
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
well it kind of assumes that they're
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do any cost cutting anywhere
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
else I think the savings are going to
 
02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
come from Personnel we talked about
 
02:48:48.190 --> 02:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
icity a duplication earlier and uh
 
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
clearly to me the the intent is to uh
 
02:48:53.950 --> 02:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
reduce uh
 
02:48:57.790 --> 02:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh you know you need one Pio
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the whole system instead of one Pio
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
for both systems having been a pi I mean
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
I think of that um so I think that the
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
the intent is to is to cut staff you
 
02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
know somehow well that that goes that
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
goes back to the uh the back the what
 
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
they call it the back office structure I
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
think that fits into that Mike what's a
 
02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
Pio but you know information
 
02:49:29.229 --> 02:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
officer that too more military
 
02:49:34.229 --> 02:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
talk sop standard operating procedure um
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh I I you know I don't know if I
 
02:49:39.309 --> 02:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree it's labor is
 
02:49:44.750 --> 02:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
obviously going to uh be impacted but
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
what about program yeah duplication of
 
02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
program what about uh facilities older
 
02:49:54.269 --> 02:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
structures uh are we going to close them
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
down are we going to consolidate um uh
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
maybe Community College into a fouryear
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
system at one location maybe in Keen um
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if it's just one issue
 
02:50:12.830 --> 02:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they're look they're going to have
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
to look at all this duplic programs um
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
do we need to have a University of New
 
02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:20.269 align:start position:0%
do we need to have a University of New
Hampshire

02:50:20.269 --> 02:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester question I don't know yeah
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um it's just like University of
 
02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
main Augusta do you need
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
that so close to gorum and so close to
 
02:50:36.910 --> 02:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
Orno so yeah it's so but he gets around
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
some other questions on that Rick it's
 
02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
the idea that some of those were
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
community colleges and they wanted to
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
offer a four-year degree and the simpler
 
02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
solution was to call it a full year
 
02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:49.590 align:start position:0%
solution was to call it a full year
fouryear

02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
fouryear
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
college yes that's that's they went
 
02:50:55.389 --> 02:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
around the barn to do that and and we've
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
had that discussion too here in this
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
state and we've always said the two
 
02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
years will remain two years not four
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
years but that might be changing as well
 
02:51:06.910 --> 02:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
um so what do we do with this number
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
here I keep it can't do any harm I guess
 
02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
no I don't think keep okay number 15
 
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
are funds available to support this
 
02:51:19.389 --> 02:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
effort in the upcoming I put Bridge
 
02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
years that came out of the Vermont study
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
the bridge year Bridge transition any
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
word like that
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay that we could put taking
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
they make question what's Bridge me you
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
could put transition in instead yeah I
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
think so yeah mergers have costs
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
building refurbishing necessary
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure human and facilities and
 
02:51:46.110 --> 02:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
branding um
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
um okay we can take all that bridge
 
02:51:53.229 --> 02:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
stuff out similar to Vermont yeah okay
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Rick would you we there was an 8 Million
 
02:51:59.630 --> 02:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
number listed earlier today with vervant
 
02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
is that kind of what do you think whe
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the8 million goes eight
 
02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
million go or was that just I think I
 
02:52:10.590 --> 02:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
think you could you could insert in
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
parentheses there uh the Vermont
 
02:52:15.950 --> 02:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
legislature provided $8 million for the
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
transition process okay sense that makes
 
02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
me they all make the point that you're
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to need to use some money to make
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
this happen yeah no matter which one of
 
02:52:31.469 --> 02:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
these you look at they all say that yeah
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
yeah to make money you need money
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we'll we'll insert that
 
02:52:40.229 --> 02:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
that art said right there in parenthesis
 
02:52:40.239 --> 02:52:41.870 align:start position:0%
that art said right there in parenthesis
number

02:52:41.870 --> 02:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:43.429 align:start position:0%
number
16

02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
16
 
02:52:43.439 --> 02:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
16
um

02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
is is the identified time frame for
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
achieving a
 
02:52:53.269 --> 02:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
governance uh a change in governance uh
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
a governance change adequate that's a
 
02:52:58.830 --> 02:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
big question yeah
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any objections to that one no
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
no number 17 will consolidation better
 
02:53:08.190 --> 02:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
support student services and decrease
 
02:53:11.429 --> 02:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
cost for academic
 
02:53:13.389 --> 02:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
support what I'm not sure what that
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
means decrease cost two questions decre
 
02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
decrease cost for academic support I'm
 
02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that what that reference is
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think uh I think Oliver is
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
correct trying to say two thoughts in
 
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
one sentence and I think by doing that
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
neither one makes sense um well the
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
first part of the question about uh you
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
know student services I as a sports guy
 
02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
I I I think in terms of teams and um I'm
 
02:53:46.429 --> 02:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
not sure where this might go but if uh
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
for example if if a several campuses
 
02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
were part of the same College uh then
 
02:53:55.710 --> 02:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
then players from different campuses
 
02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
could play in the same
 
02:53:59.710 --> 02:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
team uh that's more of a community
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
college thing you're not going to have
 
02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know UNH and teen sharing teams
 
02:54:08.910 --> 02:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
particularly no but but UNH uh anyway
 
02:54:10.750 --> 02:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
the sports piece of it the club piece of
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
it the organization piece of it the
 
02:54:15.309 --> 02:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
student Senate piece of it uh all things
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
that are important parts of campus life
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
and uh consolidation of them I I I don't
 
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
know yeah you just mentioned a whole lot
 
02:54:28.269 --> 02:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
there that it have to be really reframe
 
02:54:31.229 --> 02:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
worked I I don't know about number 17 I
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's going to make a big
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
difference in our reporting
 
02:54:38.239 --> 02:54:41.710 align:start position:0%
difference in our reporting
here

02:54:41.710 --> 02:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's it decreasing cost for academic
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
support um that that's a definite
 
02:54:51.469 --> 02:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
question is it are we going to be able
 
02:54:53.870 --> 02:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
to provide something at a lesser cost
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore maybe reducing tuition
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
cost it's like we've had during the
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic where we've had some students
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
saying hey you know it's cheaper for you
 
02:55:06.990 --> 02:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
to provide this online instruction than
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
it is for you to have the instructor in
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
the classroom or you know and they're
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
saying some students have said the value
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the online is not quite the same as
 
02:55:19.229 --> 02:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
having the face to face with the
 
02:55:22.510 --> 02:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
instructor yeah and that's why we have
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
seen a higher um failure rate amongst
 
02:55:28.750 --> 02:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
incoming freshmen this last year they
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
weren't able to adjust to the
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
online uh impersonal way of instruction
 
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the Juniors and seniors
 
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
were that's what was told to me by folks
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
University yeah they're different parts
 
02:55:46.590 --> 02:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
to that but I think what they're getting
 
02:55:49.469 --> 02:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
at in this question is do can we cut
 
02:55:52.349 --> 02:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
back somehow on student support and my
 
02:55:54.910 --> 02:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
my sense is that depends on the number
 
02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
of students no matter which system you
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
have it's really a sort of thing related
 
02:56:02.590 --> 02:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
to how many people have to be
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
served yeah I because we've taken so
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
much trying trying to figure this out I
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
just take 17 out good point all right
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay 18
 
02:56:17.429 --> 02:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
will potential Financial gains Beyond
 
02:56:20.670 --> 02:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
those of shortterm reduction in
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
administration um
 
02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
staff oh man this was late at night let
 
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.190 --> 02:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
um okay I mentioned 1995 earlier today
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh Governor Merill uh tasked the
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
community the technical colle system
 
02:56:43.750 --> 02:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
with uh uh cutting staff and he got rid
 
02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:44.590 align:start position:0%
with uh uh cutting staff and he got rid
of

02:56:44.590 --> 02:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:56:46.750 --> 02:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh three presidents uh we went from
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
seven presidents down to four which
 
02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
saved whatever it saved but then you had
 
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an unwieldy situation
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
with u I'm trying to remember how
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Nash had the same
 
02:56:58.990 --> 02:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
president so it certainly saved some
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
money but eventually they went back to
 
02:57:03.309 --> 02:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
seven presidents so what I see people
 
02:57:04.990 --> 02:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
looking at here and if there's any
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
college presidents listening to us talk
 
02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
I I'm not trying to scare anybody I'm
 
02:57:12.830 --> 02:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
not suggestions except that uh I'm sure
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
that as this moves forward people are
 
02:57:17.349 --> 02:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to say do we need a president in
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh campus a and campus B which are close
 
02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
to each other I'm not going to name any
 
02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
campuses but I'm sure that is going to
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
be part of the thinking uh I'm not
 
02:57:28.590 --> 02:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
recommending anything but having seen
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
this in 1995 I anticipate consolidation
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
and and having fewer presidents and is
 
02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
part of this well see basically this
 
02:57:40.429 --> 02:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
this if you took out the first part and
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
just put everything in parenthesis this
 
02:57:45.309 --> 02:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
is really in support of merger
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
this is a consideration stating that
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
some states have seen that it it's you
 
02:57:54.190 --> 02:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
know it has in included Financial
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
savings the leveraging of Greater size
 
02:57:58.349 --> 02:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
and scale has been important and
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
transferability of course in credits has
 
02:58:04.229 --> 02:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
been resolved um to some degree um it's
 
02:58:07.150 --> 02:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
got a lot in it I don't know if it's
 
02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:08.229 align:start position:0%
got a lot in it I don't know if it's
it's

02:58:08.229 --> 02:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
needed represent Vlad if you like that
 
02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
language would it make sense to move it
 
02:58:18.229 --> 02:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
um like as um a secondary piece of
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
number 11 which are what are the
 
02:58:23.710 --> 02:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
estimated cost cost
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
there yeah you mean put the you're Jen
 
02:58:32.269 --> 02:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting putting the
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
parenthetic note in number 11 yeah yeah
 
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
following you know if yeah that that
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good change yeah I think that
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
works thanks Jen yeah number
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
19 uh will the merger improve student
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
affordability accessibility Regional
 
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
identity and
 
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
compatibil and uh I would say
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
compatibility with regional business
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
Pathways we had one already with
 
02:59:12.190 --> 02:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:14.429 --> 02:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
we yeah number eight
 
02:59:18.910 --> 02:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
affordability but it talks about it in
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
College here an awful lot of things in
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
that question aren't
 
02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
there I think the point of this is if
 
02:59:37.590 --> 02:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
there is savings that are gathered
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
through mer mer uh merger that those
 
02:59:43.229 --> 02:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
savings can be passed down uh in terms
 
02:59:45.670 --> 02:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
of tuition Sav savings and affordability
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
for students uh I think that's the
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's the whole intent of this is to is
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
to save uh money and and I know we want
 
02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
to not um increase tuition so uh we the
 
03:00:02.030 --> 03:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
merge a result or avoid duplication I
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent of this uh
 
03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
clearly uh how to do it not our task but
 
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of duplication is a way
 
03:00:12.110 --> 03:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.590 --> 03:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
money yeah getting rid of duplication a
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
way of saying money is correct um easy
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
say it sounds a lot easier to supply
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
priest and it does as a president
 
03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
priest and it does as a president
believe

03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.309 --> 03:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
me well I think you're right
 
03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
accessibility and then the ne the end of
 
03:00:34.590 --> 03:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
it Regional identity and compatibility
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
with regional business those are two
 
03:00:38.030 --> 03:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
different things I think at least do
 
03:00:41.150 --> 03:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.389 --> 03:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
three well how about if we just have
 
03:00:45.150 --> 03:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
that will the merger improve student
 
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
period that works for
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
me the jobs careers in in one of these
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
other questions anyway yeah I think it's
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in this thing yeah so let's
 
03:01:02.910 --> 03:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
just put a period you know where the
 
03:01:06.750 --> 03:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
comma is affordability and accessibility
 
03:01:08.750 --> 03:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
period do you want to just add
 
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
accessibility to number eight that you
 
03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
accessibility to number eight that you
mentioned

03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:23.469 align:start position:0%
mentioned
earlier

03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
or keep them I mean I keep I the way we
 
03:01:27.479 --> 03:01:29.550 align:start position:0%
or keep them I mean I keep I the way we
have

03:01:29.550 --> 03:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh number 20 will the merger result in
 
03:01:38.510 --> 03:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
or avoid duplication of academic
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
programs while optimizing access to
 
03:01:47.070 --> 03:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:50.269 --> 03:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
already the duplication thing
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I see I was writing this stuff
 
03:01:54.990 --> 03:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
late and I was just starting to repeat
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I I because it doesn't really mean
 
03:02:03.630 --> 03:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
much to me right there um beyond what I
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
think we've already talked about i' take
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
number 20 out too because we remember we
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
at

03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.550 --> 03:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:26.349 --> 03:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
20 delete it yeah I don't have a problem
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
with deleting it okay let's do that okay
 
03:02:31.550 --> 03:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
number 21 will the merger enhance
 
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
Regional Economic
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
Development well
 
03:02:38.590 --> 03:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's back to n what we took out
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
I must have been in somebody's report
 
03:02:47.950 --> 03:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
that was dealing with economic
 
03:02:49.950 --> 03:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
development and this about this
 
03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
point but we took it out of the one I
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
let's leave it in here
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
then yeah I think it's a legitimate
 
03:02:59.229 --> 03:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
issue yeah yeah I do too okay let's
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
leave 21 right there um number 22 you
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
can see as I getting more tired at night
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
the sentences don't make any sense will
 
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
the merger better student opportunity to
 
03:03:13.590 --> 03:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
elevate or better enable students to
 
03:03:18.269 --> 03:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
achieve higher education level skills
 
03:03:21.790 --> 03:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
I what I was trying to do there I think
 
03:03:25.950 --> 03:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
was that if there's a a stronger
 
03:03:27.630 --> 03:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
relationship between the twos and the
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
fouryear systems could a student just
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
take courses without having to take
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
courses over again if they're going into
 
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
another program it's alignment of
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
courses and
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
materials but um I I think that uh um
 
03:03:46.830 --> 03:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
done is difficult and I don't know if
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's even necessary with where we're
 
03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:53.110 align:start position:0%
it's even necessary with where we're
going

03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:03:55.670 --> 03:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
here maybe you could just rephrase it
 
03:03:57.790 --> 03:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
and to say does it facilitate the
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
transition from one level or kind of
 
03:04:03.150 --> 03:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
program into another throughout the
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
university that's what sort of like
 
03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
number 23 is Will barriers to
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
transferring credits be reduced I think
 
03:04:10.190 --> 03:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
we've asked it then I don't think you
 
03:04:15.070 --> 03:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
need to ask it again yeah the which one
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
23 yeah the one you're just talking
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
about okay so 23's out no I I thought we
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
said 23 was in and 22 is
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
out whichever yeah see I was going to
 
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
take uh 23 and put it in and 22 out okay
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay whichever okay we just don't need
 
03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
both yeah we don't need both uh 24 with
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
two and fouryear programs working
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
jointly on the same campus or within the
 
03:04:42.359 --> 03:04:44.349 align:start position:0%
jointly on the same campus or within the
region

03:04:44.349 --> 03:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
region
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
um uh region better assist a four-year
 
03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
institution in aligning supporting
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
Regional Workforce demands
 
03:04:54.990 --> 03:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
needs I think we've sort of talked about
 
03:04:58.229 --> 03:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
that already yeah yeah so it's not I
 
03:04:59.830 --> 03:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't think you want to compromise the
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
mission on the fouryear schools by
 
03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
fudging it into the need to back
 
03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
industry for the community colleges yeah
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's there baileywick okay so let's
 
03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:09.870 align:start position:0%
that's there baileywick okay so let's
take

03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:05:13.550 --> 03:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
24 25 will the missions of the community
 
03:05:16.990 --> 03:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities be preserved
 
03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 identifies a purpose what is the
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
proposed overall mission of the proposed
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Community uh in University
 
03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
system question mark will this Mission
 
03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
support current missions of the two
 
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
institutions or supplant those mission
 
03:05:34.830 --> 03:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
statements and current institution
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
missions yeah I think the first part of
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated because you really are
 
03:05:44.229 --> 03:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
addressing that the the first
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
sentences so where where would you start
 
03:05:53.870 --> 03:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
this thing if you keep
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
it I would start with it what is the per
 
03:05:58.590 --> 03:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
proposed overall
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
mission I would start that that question
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
with that set that
 
03:06:07.070 --> 03:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
question okay what is the proposed
 
03:06:10.030 --> 03:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
overall mission of the proposed uh New
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire college and university system
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
will the mission support current
 
03:06:16.670 --> 03:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
missions of the two-year or supplant
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
those mission statements yeah
 
03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay you got that
 
03:06:30.910 --> 03:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
Jen I see H Dave's with us yes all
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
David we're on 26 of
 
03:06:37.469 --> 03:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing is we've just gone
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
down through and um identified those
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
which we'll keep out of this paper and
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
those change
 
03:06:48.750 --> 03:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
so we moved along Jen has to be out of
 
03:06:51.389 --> 03:06:51.399 align:start position:0%
here by 2:30 okay sounds good sounds
 
03:06:55.229 --> 03:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
good okay okay number 26 will the new
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
system have a single student application
 
03:07:00.429 --> 03:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
document used by the entire system or
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
will each institution have its own Penn
 
03:07:06.269 --> 03:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
State system has one upon receiving the
 
03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
application the student preparedness is
 
03:07:10.110 --> 03:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed and the student may not be
 
03:07:12.429 --> 03:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the main campus but another
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
smaller campus
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
Readiness um that that's something that
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
this system has talked about having one
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
application and so you don't have to
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
fill out one for Keane one for Plymouth
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
one for UNH and you only have to pay one
 
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
fee and and then uh if you're applying
 
03:07:39.389 --> 03:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
for UNH but UNH says we don't think this
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
is really a kid that's qualified for UNH
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
Maybe maybe Keen State might be a better
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
place but they wouldn't have to apply
 
03:07:49.389 --> 03:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
again they'd be accepted the keen on one
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
application so it's uh it's a concept
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
that some colleges are moving systems
 
03:07:56.349 --> 03:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
are moving towards um I don't know if
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's something we've discussed here so
 
03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need to put it
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
in well and Al Rick it also raises for
 
03:08:06.110 --> 03:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
me the sort of the issue around the
 
03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
community colleges at this point where
 
03:08:11.229 --> 03:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
two or three of them may specialize in a
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
certain Hospitality or whatever that's
 
03:08:15.229 --> 03:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
what you would be applying for but it
 
03:08:17.309 --> 03:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
would not be available necessarily at
 
03:08:20.150 --> 03:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
the other four right just a question on
 
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
it so I I I don't know 26 it's it's I
 
03:08:25.269 --> 03:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't think we need it no I don't need
 
03:08:28.590 --> 03:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
it here no okay number 27 will all
 
03:08:31.150 --> 03:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
levels of education and offered degrees
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
support will certification be given the
 
03:08:41.950 --> 03:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
type of support that the four-year
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
program is
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's like being handed a firecracker
 
03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
with a fuse
 
03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:50.830 align:start position:0%
with a fuse
[Laughter]

03:08:50.830 --> 03:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
lit if it doesn't if it doesn't you know
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
hit you like we need it we just don't
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
put it in you're gonna have to qualify
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
with as needed or something like that
 
03:09:03.790 --> 03:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
well let's leave it out
 
03:09:06.990 --> 03:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay by joining Community College
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
and UNH system will the two-year and the
 
03:09:11.469 --> 03:09:11.479 align:start position:0%
certificate programs lose their
 
03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
effectiveness in supporting recruiting
 
03:09:15.790 --> 03:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
the more traditional students good
 
03:09:20.110 --> 03:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
question yep I agree yeah I I that's one
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
we asked this morning with a traditional
 
03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:25.870 align:start position:0%
we asked this morning with a traditional
student

03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:28.630 align:start position:0%
student
um

03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
will okay what about 29 here will the
 
03:09:34.630 --> 03:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
transfer of credits between colleges and
 
03:09:36.429 --> 03:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
universities remain an
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
issue we picked that up already in an
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
earlier question okay so eliminate it
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm ask ask a question oh number 23 okay
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so so Rick yeah um Ju Just on
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
that one by itself um I I I I think we
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
heard um quite a bit of of testimony uh
 
03:10:01.229 --> 03:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
and and particularly this morning too on
 
03:10:03.229 --> 03:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
um on that issue and that may be
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
something that we could
 
03:10:09.790 --> 03:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
suggest uh the um the current um two
 
03:10:13.469 --> 03:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
boards of Trustees look to um
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
begin um expanding credit transfer uh
 
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities I agree with you Dave
 
03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an issue down the
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
road it's got to be looked at somewhere
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think you do ask that
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
though in 23 all right agree yeah but I
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
I liked what Oliver said you know this
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
morning too that in some cases it could
 
03:10:39.389 --> 03:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
just be getting you know getting Dean
 
03:10:39.399 --> 03:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
just be getting you know getting Dean
offices

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
offices
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:44.510 align:start position:0%
offices
together

03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:10:46.710 --> 03:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's also that you have individual
 
03:10:48.269 --> 03:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
departments being
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
accredited and or
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
programs and they're accredited by
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
institutions not NE not necessarily NY
 
03:11:00.510 --> 03:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
that they're accredited by The Nurses
 
03:11:03.229 --> 03:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
Association or this T of abet for
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
engineering technology yeah or speech
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
pathologist you
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
know so okay so we do have that in 23 um
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
going into 30 could the merger result in
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
more Balor degree programs being offered
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
in a regional location presently served
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
only by community college
 
03:11:24.190 --> 03:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
system could you have fouryear degrees
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
offered at White
 
03:11:29.469 --> 03:11:29.479 align:start position:0%
Mountain White Mountains mountains yes
 
03:11:29.479 --> 03:11:31.870 align:start position:0%
Mountain White Mountains mountains yes
yes

03:11:31.870 --> 03:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes well the closer the closer place is
 
03:11:37.389 --> 03:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
nhti they've been nudging toward it for
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
a long long time in teacher
 
03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
Ed yeah yeah I I think that's a that's
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
an important question to uh okay let's
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
let's leave it in there then Dave okay
 
03:11:51.389 --> 03:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
31 will affordability of the community
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
colleges be lost with a
 
03:11:56.429 --> 03:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
merger didn't we ask that question
 
03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
earlier another form I think we did uh
 
03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:03.429 align:start position:0%
earlier another form I think we did uh
number

03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:12:05.710 --> 03:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
eight yes we did right there number
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
eight affordability yeah okay I guess
 
03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
another way of asking the question is
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
well we're going to eliminate it okay
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
well that's one way to take care of it
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay because we got it basically
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
well we're getting done this we on the
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
third sheet now uh how can the issue of
 
03:12:32.910 --> 03:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
multiple Union contracts be handled
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
without disrupting merger efforts big
 
03:12:39.309 --> 03:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
bonfire yeah a huge huge
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
tsunami I I I didn't realize that they
 
03:12:44.190 --> 03:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
had 11 contracts at the community colge
 
03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:45.630 align:start position:0%
had 11 contracts at the community colge
amazing

03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and we didn't hear how many they
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
have at UNH we know that there's one for
 
03:12:52.469 --> 03:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
the professors at the
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
Keen one of the questions I have that I
 
03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to Is can the
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
university in this situation say can you
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
all come together and ask them to unify
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
under one Union not our choice their
 
03:13:10.269 --> 03:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
choice but that's what happened at L we
 
03:13:13.070 --> 03:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
just did it yeah because they they had
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
more votes than we had so they we took
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
their Union and I was the president and
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
so it was just one of those kind of
 
03:13:23.229 --> 03:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
Common Sense decisions Oliver you could
 
03:13:28.269 --> 03:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
do that back in 1960 This Is 2020 I know
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
well and and the D being old and one of
 
03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
the dilemas you've got you know you've
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
got different Internationals
 
03:13:39.389 --> 03:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
representing these respective uh oh yeah
 
03:13:41.229 --> 03:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and as
 
03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
and as Oliver said that can be
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional questions can be a real
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
issue too so and I think that has to be
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
figured out legally before we can really
 
03:13:53.710 --> 03:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
have any say in it oh yeah exactly
 
03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
question Shannon Reed might have some um
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
she got her hand
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
up I
 
03:14:03.790 --> 03:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
know Shannon Reed has her hand up as
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed might have some information
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
to bear on
 
03:14:09.389 --> 03:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
this is she there right now yeah you
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to recognize her yeah
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I see her
 
03:14:19.070 --> 03:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
there Shannon welcome hi thanks just
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly and I know this is ession
 
03:14:22.510 --> 03:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
for people like me to talk but I just
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
heard someone say that they heard that
 
03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
the community college system has 11
 
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
barging units and that is not the case
 
03:14:31.229 --> 03:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
we only have three bargaining units one
 
03:14:32.830 --> 03:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
across our whole system for full-time
 
03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
faculty one across our whole system for
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
adun faculty and one across our whole
 
03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
system for staff that's it I thought to
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
clear that up I thought I thought uh
 
03:14:46.950 --> 03:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
Susan said they had 11 no we have we
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
have 11 locations seven main campuses
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
and then a handful of academic centers
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
in places like Littleton okay and
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but only three bargaining
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
units thank you thank you very much yeah
 
03:15:05.469 --> 03:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
makes it a little easier yeah yeah okay
 
03:15:09.389 --> 03:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
okay 33 will a merger offer better
 
03:15:11.870 --> 03:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to assess and possibly
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplication of programs
 
03:15:19.150 --> 03:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
system maybe you want to stick
 
03:15:25.630 --> 03:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
question where well will they
 
03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:30.189 align:start position:0%
question where well will they
necessarily

03:15:30.189 --> 03:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
reduce in other words they I think the
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
question they they might be needed you
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
might need it in two different places
 
03:15:38.830 --> 03:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
because of demand doesn't mean you
 
03:15:42.070 --> 03:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
should cut it down to none or one just
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah there are programs that you have
 
03:15:48.030 --> 03:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
within a university sometimes that
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
program may not bring any Revenue in the
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
pay for it so it's offset from revenue
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere else within the system I.E
 
03:15:57.870 --> 03:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
maybe our law school but right but you
 
03:16:01.469 --> 03:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
can't get rid of it well we should I was
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
just thinking you might have it on both
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
sides of the state a program in somebody
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
else said Hospitality earlier but you
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
could have those and serve people on the
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
coast and people in the mountains
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know and and it's not even though
 
03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
it's duplication it's needed
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:26.910 --> 03:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
consideration just for the record you
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
rejected a similar one
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
earlier thank you
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.870 --> 03:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
20 um you
 
03:16:42.510 --> 03:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
know I I don't think it's needed all
 
03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:46.750 align:start position:0%
know I I don't think it's needed all
right

03:16:46.750 --> 03:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.750 --> 03:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated because I'm relying on the
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
other sheets you guys put together to
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
have something like
 
03:16:54.830 --> 03:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
it well the the council's gonna come up
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
with more questions too right of course
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
they are that's right that's right
 
03:17:01.150 --> 03:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
number 34 as occurred in Maine in the
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
70s the four systems fouryear system
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
rapidly expanded to a smaller
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
communities Okay blah blah blah this
 
03:17:09.630 --> 03:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
satellite expansion resulted in New
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
Capital and operational costs that are
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
now unsustained able without significant
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
increases in state support or other
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources such as tuition and fees
 
03:17:21.070 --> 03:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
as a small state New Hampshire also has
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
small institutions with capital and
 
03:17:26.269 --> 03:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
operation costs that duplicate Services
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the larger or main institution is the
 
03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
new board task in identifying duplicity
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
and if necessary recommending closure of
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
institutions there's a lot there that's
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
a huge hug question that's even bigger
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
firecracker well take duplicity out
 
03:17:54.269 --> 03:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
anyway even if
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
a yeah you want
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
duplication I think that it's you know
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
it's probably it's just too much um it
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:18:09.150 --> 03:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
unanswerable at this point in time right
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking a different story right
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
now here governance and and some of
 
03:18:15.150 --> 03:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
those other issues which we previously
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
offered for
 
03:18:19.150 --> 03:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
consideration have we addressed so any
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
other questions um and Jen I'm looking
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
for you for this have we about the issue
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
of of capital costs capital on
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
operational costs have we have we
 
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
addressed that in another question
 
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
because that is an important question
 
03:18:40.830 --> 03:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
here dealing with capital and
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
operational costs
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
the duplicity of those
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that that question's been bounced
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
around by the trustees when I was there
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
many a time yeah uh especially wasn't
 
03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
thisle dealing with the campuses it was
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
program um so one of the things you
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
might want to allow for is things
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
happening in the future we can't
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate for example at L they kept
 
03:19:14.070 --> 03:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
the music program beautiful buildings
 
03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
all kinds of wonderful music stuff and
 
03:19:19.150 --> 03:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
then the schools stopped having school
 
03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
music programs and the entire Market
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
Drive Drew up just dried out went away
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have any choice but to
 
03:19:29.229 --> 03:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
close the College of Music because there
 
03:19:32.910 --> 03:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't anybody hiring music teachers and
 
03:19:35.229 --> 03:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
that just sort of popped on the horizon
 
03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
and suddenly that whole issue became a
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
place they could save money
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
on so so so maybe maybe along the lines
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
of what Oliver was saying uh is to cast
 
03:19:50.429 --> 03:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
this question a different way to um to
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know evaluate the um the
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
resources um uh in order to meet um
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
demands student need and the marketplace
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
Jen not quite can you say it again Dave
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
so so just sort of recasting it as
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know uh you know closing
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
things just um being able to to adapt um
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
um highered resources in order to meet
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of students and the um um
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
greater um economy or Market changing
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um so I've got will will the merger
 
03:20:40.469 --> 03:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
facilitate adaptation to changing Market
 
03:20:43.269 --> 03:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
demands yeah yeah
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
good number 35 is there an exception
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
expectation that all institutions will
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
continue to be independently
 
03:20:54.429 --> 03:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
accredited that that I think that's an
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
important question because we we raised
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
that with Brit brittenham this morning
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
regarding um the meaning of
 
03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
accreditation and how it how will impact
 
03:21:07.469 --> 03:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
then she mentioned the issue of the the
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
university system in uh in Maine how
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
they try to have a system wide
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
accreditation of programs yeah I would
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
suggest in this one we say initially yes
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and then it will be reconsidered by the
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
new Chancellor once in office or
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
something to that
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
effect I mean right right now we've got
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
two systems and every institution in
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
those systems is separately accredited
 
03:21:35.189 --> 03:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
right yeah yes
 
03:21:38.110 --> 03:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and some programs within those
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
institutions are accredited have
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
specific accreditations right yeah
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
nursing engineering technology stuff
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
like that yeah but you'll just scare
 
03:21:48.189 --> 03:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
people if you say you're going to change
 
03:21:50.309 --> 03:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
them from day one
 
03:21:53.469 --> 03:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
yeah hey Rick I have a timeline question
 
03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
um if I could we're looking they're
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
looking to have something in place by
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
like uh June July 1st of 03 of of 2003
 
03:22:02.920 --> 03:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
like uh June July 1st of 03 of of 2003
right

03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
2023 it's a different
 
03:22:11.590 --> 03:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
bium um because this is going to be a
 
03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of this is to save money uh
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and to cut cut cut that's just the
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
reality it's going to be very
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
painful and it's not our job to make
 
03:22:23.070 --> 03:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
those decisions other than to just flag
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
questions but my question to to you or
 
03:22:29.790 --> 03:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
anybody is um 2023 is a different bium
 
03:22:31.469 --> 03:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
it'll be a different
 
03:22:31.479 --> 03:22:33.269 align:start position:0%
it'll be a different
legislature

03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh if if a new chancel comes in and they
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan that cuts all this
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
stuff uh could this all be thrown out by
 
03:22:43.469 --> 03:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
a new
 
03:22:47.790 --> 03:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:50.590 --> 03:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
23 well that's always a possibility but
 
03:22:55.229 --> 03:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
created a process that's that's
 
03:23:01.950 --> 03:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan or bipartisan I mean this is
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a an issue that we're
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
all concerned about so my hope Mike
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
would be that if if the planning is done
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately that the rec
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations will be sustained uh I
 
03:23:17.550 --> 03:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
think the real question is going to be
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
it always comes down to the funding part
 
03:23:22.110 --> 03:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
I mean regardless of the structure you
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
have there's going to be dollar signs
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
behind it and so I think that's going to
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
be the real question about how how it
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
can be
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
measured well we're just flagging
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
questions here we're not really making
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
any exactly right yeah but the key uh
 
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
Matt Mel and everybody is uh whoever is
 
03:23:41.710 --> 03:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
on whatever committee is put together
 
03:23:44.429 --> 03:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
together to make these tough decisions
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh I know when Ray Burton was up uh in
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
district one you know was talking about
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh closing Burling Berlin or cutting
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
back on Berlin way way back and Ray said
 
03:23:58.830 --> 03:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
Over My Dead Body and Ry was right um so
 
03:24:01.469 --> 03:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a a a political you
 
03:24:03.389 --> 03:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
know folks are going to mobilize to save
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
their campus or their program um so
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm just I'm just trying to
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate um how this is going to play
 
03:24:14.110 --> 03:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
out uh I I don't know I I just uh it's
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to be hard and uh well that that's
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
why I think it's so
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
key to have a strong planning process
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
because in that planning process like my
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
presumption is is that those voices are
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to be heard now granted some tough
 
03:24:31.510 --> 03:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
decisions may have to be made but at
 
03:24:34.990 --> 03:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
least if the process is clean and is
 
03:24:37.269 --> 03:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
transparent it would seem to me that
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
that the ultimately the ultimate
 
03:24:42.670 --> 03:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made are going to be
 
03:24:45.189 --> 03:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
more Universal than they are if they're
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
just for example in just the budgetary
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
process that has limited input from all
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the P part parties that are involved in
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
this thing so I you know I think the
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
transparency question I think hopefully
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
will address some of the issues that
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about and I'm concerned
 
03:25:04.469 --> 03:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
about too so well a cautionary tale here
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
is what happened in verar a year ago
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
they had their Chancellor or their head
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
guy uh who recommended closing Johnson
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
and closing l
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
and they a week later he was gone and uh
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
they they kept those both campuses open
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
to some degree so who whoever is whoever
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
is the the head guy here I guarantee
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
they're going to be aware of what
 
03:25:28.670 --> 03:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
happened to Vermont I'm just I'm just
 
03:25:31.070 --> 03:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
thinking ahead uh
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
process-wise anyway well Mike I think
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct in terms of I
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
there will be a human cry coming out
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
regarding ing White Mountains Community
 
03:25:46.269 --> 03:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
College if something happens there that
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
the North Country survives around that
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
Community College and it's it's it's
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
part of the E it's an economic driver in
 
03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
that neck of the woods uh I I think
 
03:25:59.790 --> 03:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
you're gonna see that there that's one
 
03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why um uh some people may
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
be advocating a Slowdown here to get
 
03:26:08.910 --> 03:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
some assurances that Community College
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
is going to still continue to serve the
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
mission that they have been tasked to do
 
03:26:19.590 --> 03:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
areas so uh what number are we on now I
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
think we're on
 
03:26:29.469 --> 03:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh the I think we're on number
 
03:26:32.189 --> 03:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
36 with the decline in K through 12
 
03:26:34.349 --> 03:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
students can New Hampshire afford not to
 
03:26:34.359 --> 03:26:36.510 align:start position:0%
students can New Hampshire afford not to
merge

03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
merge
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
institutions that's a question good
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah it needs to be
 
03:26:42.910 --> 03:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
answered you that that enrollment that
 
03:26:46.590 --> 03:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
demographic is really uh causing a lot
 
03:26:49.950 --> 03:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
of Heartache K through 12 and
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
postsecondary so so I I think related to
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
that Rick um would would be the the
 
03:26:57.990 --> 03:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
question of what's expected from a
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
merger that's going to improve the um
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
the the the way the university system
 
03:27:08.670 --> 03:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
and the community college system will be
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
able to respond to um to student uh
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
needs or student demand and um and also
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
related to that I think is would a um
 
03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
would how would a merger potentially
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
complicate the ability of the two
 
03:27:30.790 --> 03:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
systems to um to Pivot more quickly or
 
03:27:33.550 --> 03:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
respond more quickly to changes in
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
Market demands as I think what you
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier Dave what you
 
03:27:40.189 --> 03:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier how will this how will
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
a merger impact this demographic change
 
03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh is the is the issue how is the the
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
the merger going to really impact how uh
 
03:27:55.469 --> 03:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
we address this loss of
 
03:27:58.110 --> 03:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
students yeah how is how is the merger
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
part of the solution yeah yeah and and
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know you know let's just say
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
everything was perfect right now
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything's perfect and we want to
 
03:28:11.229 --> 03:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
merge the two systems that's a huge
 
03:28:14.189 --> 03:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
undertaking right there at least from
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
everything I think we've read and heard
 
03:28:21.309 --> 03:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
um and so so so could emerger complicate
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
the um development of
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
solutions I think we're getting now down
 
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
into some of the considerations when I
 
03:28:30.750 --> 03:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
was reading the materials that came in
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
from uh the day we had the university
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
system um respond to us in Wednesday I'm
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
just looking at 36 on downwards and a
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
lot of them deal with
 
03:28:47.469 --> 03:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
this so Jen did you get the possible
 
03:28:49.389 --> 03:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
change there to
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
36 afterward it says K through 12
 
03:28:56.910 --> 03:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
students how will the uh proposed
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
merger what you say influence or impact
 
03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
or help cont contribute to um to
 
03:29:06.309 --> 03:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
addressing to meeting the market needs
 
03:29:06.319 --> 03:29:07.510 align:start position:0%
addressing to meeting the market needs
yeah

03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
yeah of New Hampshire students of New
 
03:29:13.150 --> 03:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well it's it's it's it's that
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
but also it's it's Market
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
needs because we serve more than just
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students we kind of used
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
that language in number
 
03:29:25.870 --> 03:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
34 34 we took out didn't
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
we well we took out and replaced it with
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
how will the merger facilitate
 
03:29:33.309 --> 03:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
adaptation to changing Market
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
great so is that the same or different
 
03:29:45.389 --> 03:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
I would say student Market demands so
 
03:29:48.030 --> 03:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's clear what the I think Market
 
03:29:52.030 --> 03:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
demands is the market is driving the
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards here all right okay all
 
03:29:56.830 --> 03:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's it's it's it's economy
 
03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
it's yeah you know okay Market
 
03:30:04.750 --> 03:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's okay if we have a couple that
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
are sort of the same but you know we're
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
getting a point across let's go on to
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
the next one 37
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
37 can the community college system and
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
University system sustain the following
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
conditions net tuition decline
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
significant student population declines
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
projected a projected continuance oh
 
03:30:27.510 --> 03:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah projected declines I think you
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
could have it stop right there high
 
03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
levels of student debt high levels of
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
student tuition a regional decline in
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
eligible post-secondary students costs
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
associated with the pandemic and other
 
03:30:43.990 --> 03:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
lot in there what was the what was the
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
time of the night that you put that one
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
in there it it was probably closing in
 
03:30:54.389 --> 03:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
o' you want to leave it out fine leave
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
it out I no no I I you know but I think
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
we got to address um the the student
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
debt that we haven't talked about um
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
student debt is causing a lot of people
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
to say I'm not going to go to school
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
yeah high cost same deal yeah I I I
 
03:31:21.189 --> 03:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
think it's an important question I think
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe open it up to be a how will as
 
03:31:28.750 --> 03:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to can yeah okay and and um and
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
you know with with respect to to student
 
03:31:35.070 --> 03:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
debt um you know that cuts both ways too
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the um the maybe I'm
 
03:31:37.680 --> 03:31:39.030 align:start position:0%
both in terms of the um the maybe I'm
scared

03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
scared
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
Away by you know know the possibility of
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
student debt um and then if I incur a
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
lot of student debt uh can I continue to
 
03:31:50.990 --> 03:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
afford my higher education and if I
 
03:31:55.630 --> 03:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
don't attain a degree um you know what
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
then I mean the the student debt issue
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.910 --> 03:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah representative glad um in that
 
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
first um Clause after the colon net
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
declines yeah it would be the revenue
 
03:32:20.189 --> 03:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
yeah but okay I'm just gonna add that
 
03:32:22.030 --> 03:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
word then
 
03:32:22.040 --> 03:32:28.990 align:start position:0%
word then
yeah

03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:32.670 --> 03:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um baked into that that question
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
too Rick um do you is there a because
 
03:32:38.110 --> 03:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
you've got student
 
03:32:42.750 --> 03:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
debt um what about things like like um
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
like um financial
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
aid yeah that's part of it as well
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
because now we're having to give more
 
03:32:53.309 --> 03:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
time the increase the increased need of
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
financial aid yeah where's that going to
 
03:32:59.439 --> 03:33:00.429 align:start position:0%
financial aid yeah where's that going to
come

03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:33:02.550 --> 03:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
from the revenue of the support
 
03:33:05.189 --> 03:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
financial aid well you know what one of
 
03:33:07.389 --> 03:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
the things we heard was you know back in
 
03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
the day the the decision for tuition be
 
03:33:14.429 --> 03:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
placed so high was to was to basically
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
provide the the um the 100 100% of
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
need and and then at some point I think
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
what did what did we learn 10 years ago
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
need part meeting 100% of need
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
uhuh so so that that was there I think
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
to justify the uh the the higher than
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
average U you know on a state basis uh
 
03:33:44.720 --> 03:33:46.550 align:start position:0%
average U you know on a state basis uh
tuition

03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:48.269 align:start position:0%
tuition
costs

03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
MH well we're not getting into the the
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
national Politics on this but was
 
03:33:55.189 --> 03:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned by someone that there is a
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
proposal to double theel Grant
 
03:34:00.269 --> 03:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility which whatever happened with
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah that would feed into the
 
03:34:05.429 --> 03:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
student sort of the student debt thing
 
03:34:08.830 --> 03:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
at some point yeah yeah and and and the
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
things that Mike's talked about too with
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
regards to maybe other tuition you know
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
programs that are being discussed at the
 
03:34:18.189 --> 03:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
federal level so we probably want to
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
incorporate I mean that's a big it's a
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so do we have enough in there right
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
convey go ahead Mike well I I had a
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
couple things I wanted to say but I
 
03:34:40.189 --> 03:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want to say them until we were
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
for are you you don't want to do it
 
03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
for are you you don't want to do it
right

03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
now okay real quick I think I'm not sure
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a question to this effect but
 
03:34:54.429 --> 03:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
I think Pro probably the most important
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
question we need to ask and I'm not sure
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
if it's been asked clearly is who are
 
03:34:59.950 --> 03:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the decision makers and
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are going to implement
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
the the new structuring and it's
 
03:35:07.630 --> 03:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
critically important it's like uh
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
whatever happens will be a function of
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the committee
 
03:35:13.389 --> 03:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
or the the board or whoever is going to
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
be making these decisions and unless the
 
03:35:18.670 --> 03:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
board has some highly respected like Gus
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
G guson Walter Peterson types uh John
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
Lynch types uh crucial uh because if the
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
board is seen as being stacked it won't
 
03:35:31.070 --> 03:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
work now I don't know how how that's
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to be uh
 
03:35:35.950 --> 03:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
determined uh and you know there needs
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh you know Regional meetings and
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of input and we're going to be
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's going to be people
 
03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
lobbying and and arguing for their
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
campus and their program big time so
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to have some
 
03:35:50.429 --> 03:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
guts um and some finesse and some
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
patience to make this work it's
 
03:35:55.229 --> 03:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
gonna it's got to be the good people I
 
03:35:56.830 --> 03:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
don't know who they are but Walter
 
03:35:59.309 --> 03:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
Peterson's no longer here but people
 
03:36:02.189 --> 03:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
like that and also you know I'm also
 
03:36:04.670 --> 03:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if if we will have next year
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
in House Education next January uh bills
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
related to this I I don't know I'm I'm
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
just I can just see people putting
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
preemptively proposed legislation to uh
 
03:36:19.389 --> 03:36:19.399 align:start position:0%
you know try to save some some peace at
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
their a so anyway uh my big point is to
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
me about the most important question is
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
who is going to be making the final
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
decisions well it's going to be your
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
your trustees are going to be making
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
that decision that that board of
 
03:36:40.189 --> 03:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
governance the fif the 15 yeah and and
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
the see and we heard today that you know
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
the way we're we're proposed to set it
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
up here according to hb2 is that there's
 
03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
so many coming out of this level so many
 
03:36:51.309 --> 03:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
out of this level and then we have this
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
other group then we have a number of
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
other people that are exop ficio types
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
um and down the roadways it's going to
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
be one system it's no longer going to be
 
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
premised upon Community College or this
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly and and so it's just like
 
03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
you're selecting board if you a lot of
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
different precincts within your
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
community some folks advocate well I
 
03:37:16.830 --> 03:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
have to have one from this Precinct one
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
from this Precinct but you're acting on
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of the total town and you got to
 
03:37:24.510 --> 03:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
get away from that regionalism you got
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
to go for your mission what's your
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
mission to have something that works um
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
for all so so so I think that report
 
03:37:36.429 --> 03:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
that that letter that Dr bringham um
 
03:37:38.429 --> 03:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
provided us this morning and spoke to
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
this morning I think has some
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
um important elements for that Rick for
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
the con for the constituencies of that
 
03:37:50.910 --> 03:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
group well for the for the
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
constituencies but also the size the
 
03:37:56.229 --> 03:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
voting right you know things like that
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
and and um and obviously you know the
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
work that they do has to be durable in
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
nature and not U not you know
 
03:38:05.229 --> 03:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
politically flighty or anything like
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that so okay so so what we need to do on
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
this discussion that Mike brought up
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
because we're getting a
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
from this but we needed to put that down
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
on on a piece of paper beside us hey we
 
03:38:17.469 --> 03:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
got to get back to that that's got to be
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
added in here let's do that at the end
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the question that's exactly so so is
 
03:38:26.429 --> 03:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
37 good the way it is or do we want to
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
dump it what's the the feeling of the
 
03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee we got to get by this quickly
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
here Jen's gonna have to leave here
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
shortly I think she put financial aid
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and some other stuff into it yeah I
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
added high demand for financial aid
 
03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let's go on to
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
38 can the state continue to sustain
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
support the community college system at
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
the current funding
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
level I don't know if that's really
 
03:39:02.670 --> 03:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah because every is going to say we
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
always need more and they probably do 39
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
the merger proposal is accompanied with
 
03:39:18.910 --> 03:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
a 9% cut in state Support over two years
 
03:39:22.269 --> 03:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
for the combined system from that that
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
statement you know you could you could
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
turn it into you know develop a develop
 
03:39:37.269 --> 03:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
a cash flow U or CA yeah cash flow
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
analysis based on merger activities yeah
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
flow the cash flow directed to merger
 
03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:50.910 align:start position:0%
flow the cash flow directed to merger
efforts

03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah can you work something around that
 
03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:56.070 align:start position:0%
yeah can you work something around that
uh

03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
Jen sure cash
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
flow are we talking about the eight
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
million that we stuck in the number 15
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
or no that's the bridge money that's the
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
transition money I got it well well the
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
this would this would be that as as well
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
Rick I think it's related so so money
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
that would have to go in additional
 
03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
money that would have to go into a
 
03:40:21.389 --> 03:40:21.399 align:start position:0%
merger effort and and money that would
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
spring coming out of a merger effort as
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
well through efficiencies or something
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
like that see this this right here
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
though is looking at money that cost now
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
what the projecting cost will
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
be yeah it it so does the cash flow yeah
 
03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
over a period of years okay let's go on
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
to number
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
40 can UNH compete and remain
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
competitive with you UMass when out of
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
state institutions are undercutting
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
tuition and offering New Hampshire
 
03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
rates that's one of the reasons
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
why we may be in trouble yeah that's a
 
03:41:04.349 --> 03:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
reality that's part of the reality check
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here I I think
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
I changed the question into how does New
 
03:41:09.199 --> 03:41:10.710 align:start position:0%
I changed the question into how does New
Hampshire

03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah increase its competitiveness okay
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
good next question is very
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
similar can the New Hampshire system
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
survive when the state remains an
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
exporter of graduating high school
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
students I think we've already addressed
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
good number 42 the legislator should be
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
more involved in through uh involved
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
through the public higher education
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
study committee pursuant to be engaged
 
03:41:48.990 --> 03:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
in this process that committee has
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
specific responsibility to examine the
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
goals purposes organization and
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
financing of higher education in New
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah I think the question
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:42:00.389 --> 03:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
what yeah the question there I think is
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
03:42:05.349 --> 03:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
role what should the what should the
 
03:42:08.149 --> 03:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
what should the the role be of the
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
higher education study Comm well we
 
03:42:13.469 --> 03:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
already know what that is that's in
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
statute the legislature knows that
 
03:42:20.429 --> 03:42:20.439 align:start position:0%
so what is the role for that group to
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
participate in this process there is at
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
this point in time it's not so Senator
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
Ward is the head of that correct right
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
now yes yeah the the chair of the senate
 
03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee education committee this year
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
I was there last year it alternates back
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
and forth Mike one year one session it's
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
a Senate the other is the house the
 
03:42:44.309 --> 03:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
senator Ward would be the convenor I
 
03:42:44.319 --> 03:42:45.269 align:start position:0%
senator Ward would be the convenor I
guess

03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm not sure if anybody's
 
03:42:50.429 --> 03:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
talk to her
 
03:42:53.070 --> 03:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
about no I don't think for on the
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee this year on her side you have
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward Senator Reagan and Lou
 
03:43:03.469 --> 03:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
delandro so is this question intended to
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
be no I think it was more of a question
 
03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
this I guess it's a just a statement to
 
03:43:21.870 --> 03:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature we need to get engaged
 
03:43:26.189 --> 03:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
exactly well you know in in last year's
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
last session's um higher education study
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
commission uh we did learn a lot of
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
things that I think manifested in um in
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
in legislative action one of them I
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
think related to um to institu U debt
 
03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
and um and how they go about um um
 
03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
and um and how they go about um um
issuing

03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
issuing
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
bonds Mel do you remember that yeah yeah
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
right it's part of it's part of the
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
report yeah so so um um so I I would I
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
would say not you know not losing sight
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the higher education commission's you
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
know role in um in the financial
 
03:44:05.950 --> 03:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our higher ed system I
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
know the year that I chaired that group
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
there was a a huge discussion on whether
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
the community college should have offer
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
four-year degree program
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and Ross was pushing that and of
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
it I think I I think it's the fact that
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
we have it it's in the it's in the law
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
and it somehow is going to have to be
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
part of this process so I think just
 
03:44:37.149 --> 03:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
mentioning it putting it in is important
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
so I think it's and I think if there's a
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
a council a group that's going to be
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
during the Slowdown that we're looking
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
at a coordinating Council they need to
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
report to this
 
03:44:53.429 --> 03:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
body at certain
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
benchmarks uh whatever the time frame
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
may be or we need to have that body or
 
03:45:01.469 --> 03:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
some represent representation from the
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
house involved in that
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
body um I don't want to be driving the
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
getting down on micromanaging don't want
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
to do that I want the folks that uh
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
Barbara brittenham was really saying you
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
have to have those knowledgeable people
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
in that job not that legislators are not
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
but uh uh we need to be informed so it
 
03:45:26.349 --> 03:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
comes back to the question again is what
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
is the role of this higher education
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
study committee in this merger
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
proposition well that that last sentence
 
03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
there comes right out of Statute yeah
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
the committee has specific
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility to examine the goal the
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
purposes um organization and financing
 
03:45:44.670 --> 03:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
of the higher education and it
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
specifically States the four
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
universities and Community College
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
system so I think if you say what is the
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
role in light of that last
 
03:45:56.830 --> 03:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
sentence that's the question what his
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
role in light of the merger proposal
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah so so so Rick I think
 
03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I think the higher
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
education study commission can certainly
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
provide information to the um the the
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
merger what are we calling it now merger
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
Council yeah we haven't we haven't put a
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
tag on it yet we hav gone there yet Dave
 
03:46:21.309 --> 03:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but but um but I think it I
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be really clear of
 
03:46:26.110 --> 03:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
what the role of the whatever we're
 
03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
calling the the the merger um commission
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
or the merger Council what its role is
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of reporting back to the
 
03:46:36.429 --> 03:46:36.439 align:start position:0%
legislature and EXE the legislative I I
 
03:46:38.349 --> 03:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
think we got to go even deeper than that
 
03:46:40.590 --> 03:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
I think we what is the role of this
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
higher education group in terms of The
 
03:46:46.990 --> 03:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
hb2 to merge you know that's what the
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
whole thing is about we're changing our
 
03:46:53.710 --> 03:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
system all
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
around and and yet we have in statute
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
right now a process which we're supposed
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be informed and
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
involved so it you know what is the role
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the higher education study committee
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
in regard to the proposal as identified
 
03:47:12.399 --> 03:47:13.229 align:start position:0%
in regard to the proposal as identified
in

03:47:13.229 --> 03:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay I think something that this uh
 
03:47:19.229 --> 03:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
the higher educ a study committee could
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
do would be a very limited uh Mission or
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
role perhaps would be to do what I think
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
is maybe the most crucial thing which is
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
identify uh 10 20 30 40 50 potential
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
members of the board that that will be
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
so important in in to screen them and
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
and you know just to to do that piece of
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
it is I think is a very limited Mission
 
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
but very important missions that's just
 
03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
one one
 
03:47:52.830 --> 03:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
idea see I don't want politics to start
 
03:47:55.710 --> 03:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
steering that ship either but yeah I I I
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
do believe that we need to be engaged in
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
this this process and it shouldn't be
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
after the fact this this statutory
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
language which is in 187a is there for a
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
reason it's just like you were talking
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
about what you identified last in the
 
03:48:12.439 --> 03:48:14.469 align:start position:0%
about what you identified last in the
last

03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:48:17.149 --> 03:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
bium state your question again about the
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
role because I think you I think that
 
03:48:18.840 --> 03:48:20.349 align:start position:0%
role because I think you I think that
was

03:48:20.349 --> 03:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:48:20.359 --> 03:48:22.189 align:start position:0%
was
it

03:48:22.189 --> 03:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
um what is the role of
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
the public higher education study
 
03:48:30.670 --> 03:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee and then you can put pursuant
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
the RSA in regard to proposed
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
language reflected concerning the merger
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the the the the postsecondary
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
education uh in HB to I I like what Mike
 
03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:50.429 align:start position:0%
education uh in HB to I I like what Mike
was

03:48:50.429 --> 03:48:50.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
suggesting because I think that we we
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
haven't even come we we haven't even
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
asked that question or certainly
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
answered answered it where where do
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
these members come from but that's a
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
second qu that's a secondary
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
question that's that's that could be the
 
03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
role for the higher education
 
03:49:13.630 --> 03:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
committee to in in consultation with
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
let's say the system boards and the
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
chancellor I create a stable of
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
potential board members it can be uh 50
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
people who knows but that I think that
 
03:49:28.590 --> 03:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
they that might be a good role for them
 
03:49:32.110 --> 03:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
and it's limited and clear and uh and
 
03:49:34.349 --> 03:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
not hopefully fairly nonpolitical I mean
 
03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
without recommending anybody
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
specifically just
 
03:49:41.149 --> 03:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
identify uh really good people that
 
03:49:42.990 --> 03:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
people respect and trust and can work
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
together and get get 50 names and and
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
then uh can go from there yeah yeah yeah
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I agree with that uh
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's I think that we're just getting a
 
03:49:54.429 --> 03:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
little bit outside of where we need to
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
be as a legislature I think that we're
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
looking at people that are in the the
 
03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
system right now that are quite capable
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not anywhere near I don't have the
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
capabilities that a Don Burks has I
 
03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
don't have that and when I'm looking at
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know all the little ins and
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
outs that are necessary for to make this
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
thing work whereas the the person like
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
ausan hu is the person like a Don Burks
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
is um the person like a Todd leech is um
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
those are the people that you know live
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
and breathe it and know it um yes there
 
03:50:33.149 --> 03:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
should be others not just Educators I
 
03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
agree but um you know you I I think you
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
you were looking at a system which is is
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to be hiring a CEO and developing
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
a system which is huge business in our
 
03:50:49.149 --> 03:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
state uh I I think we need to have that
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
expertise um when we're trying to
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
identify them let me tie this into
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
something called bra BR base closing and
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
realignment commission and and that was
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
to do what we're trying to do uh we had
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
too many uh military bases around the
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
country and uh Schwarz goof wanted to
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
close a base in Arkansas and Senator MCL
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
said you're never going to close that so
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
what they did they they created
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
a independent commission that was
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
ostensibly free of politics and they
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
took politics out of it and they just
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
looked at criteria for which bases to
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
close now that's what we're talking
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
about here so all I'm saying is that the
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
notion of having a New Hampshire version
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
of Brack uh who will uh look at criteria
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
make recommendations with his little
 
03:51:41.590 --> 03:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
politics is you you take Ray Burton out
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
of it uh you know what I said before
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
about Ray saying you'll never close
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
Berlin so anyway that this Brack model
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
might be something we somebody might
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
bit well for purpose of moving on
 
03:51:58.750 --> 03:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to identify
 
03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
that when we get to this bottom line
 
03:52:02.590 --> 03:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
when we're making a recommendation for
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
establishing a slow down coordinating
 
03:52:07.429 --> 03:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
type Council
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
um I for this particular statement right
 
03:52:13.469 --> 03:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
there I'm trying to just get the this
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
particular committee engaged in this
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
process and at this point it's not been
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
involved and there's there hasn't been
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
any effort to involve them um so we have
 
03:52:29.710 --> 03:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
stepped in and filled that void this
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
group right here but once we get this
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
report and we are able to do that
 
03:52:36.510 --> 03:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
because we were requested by the finance
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
division 2 to do that we don't have any
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to be going ahead
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
and doing an independent study like
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
this I don't believe but let's let's mik
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
let's hold the Brack conversation once
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
we get through these other questions
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
because I do think there needs to be a
 
03:52:58.830 --> 03:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
conversation about what that
 
03:53:01.030 --> 03:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating group might look like which
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
is what you're talking about yeah so
 
03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
let's get through the questions and then
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with that composition yeah so
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
so so Rick um
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um our work group is really an ad hoc
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
work group right yeah yeah and and so
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know we we've we've formed up the
 
03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
higher educ higher education study
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
commission exist committee exists right
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
now and um and it may not be a bad idea
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
for um for maybe Rick and Ruth to talk
 
03:53:32.800 --> 03:53:34.429 align:start position:0%
for um for maybe Rick and Ruth to talk
about

03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
um all of us getting together at a
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
higher education study commiss committee
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
meeting talk about some of these things
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
find out what role they want to play in
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
it they are the formal um
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
legislative um oversight committee not
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
us and um uh but we can we can help with
 
03:53:58.030 --> 03:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
with with the Trans with the I don't
 
03:54:00.269 --> 03:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
know what do you want to call it um
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
because we've been working on this for
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
two weeks yeah I I think that's that's
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate Dave
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:11.349 align:start position:0%
appropriate Dave
um

03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
the question I think there is a question
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
around what is the role of this
 
03:54:17.229 --> 03:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
committee going to be yeah I think that
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
we got word 42 asking that question what
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
is the role of the higher education
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
Commission in regard to hb2
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
right okay let's get on to the next one
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
here because we got to go through the
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
other sheet as well um what is the
 
03:54:36.510 --> 03:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
expected let's see where are we now yeah
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
what is the expected timeline Beyond
 
03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:39.389 align:start position:0%
what is the expected timeline Beyond
merch

03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
merch
 
03:54:39.399 --> 03:54:40.550 align:start position:0%
merch
governance

03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
governance
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
43 43 I I don't that's you know I think
 
03:54:48.149 --> 03:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's a what if type
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
necessary I can live with
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to start on the sheet that
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
Dave and
 
03:55:09.630 --> 03:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh Mel put together here because we got
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
another I I think as we as as go this I
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
think we've covered some of the it's not
 
03:55:19.750 --> 03:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
new territory here so we can should be
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
able go through this through this pretty
 
03:55:23.710 --> 03:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
quickly yeah okay so let's go on number
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
one on on that sheet right now and the
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
first question is what should be the
 
03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
mission of the higher educ of higher
 
03:55:32.670 --> 03:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
education in New
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good question I think I think
 
03:55:39.189 --> 03:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
that is the the I don't think think we
 
03:55:41.950 --> 03:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
asked that specifically we talked about
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
missions but I think what is the what
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to do is a pretty
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
basic question as we get into this uh
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
whole merger
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
question you know and and uh I I could
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
combine number two into number
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
one um you know what should be the
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
mission of the higher education in New
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is the current education
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
mission of community Consciousness
 
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
compatible yes yeah just no no I I think
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's two separate questions because I
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
think in question two it's are they
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
compatible with each other not whether
 
03:56:18.189 --> 03:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
they're compatible with the mission of
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
higher education are you saying in
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
number two that the community college
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
and you're asking if those two missions
 
03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:26.110 align:start position:0%
and you're asking if those two missions
are

03:56:26.110 --> 03:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:56:30.670 --> 03:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
compatible that's how I read it
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah true y okay so that you're looking
 
03:56:36.750 --> 03:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
at it from a different angle yeah so
 
03:56:38.189 --> 03:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
there two there are two separate
 
03:56:41.550 --> 03:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
questions there okay so I'm good with
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
one and two how about everybody else
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
yes number three what would be the
 
03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
authority of the merger commission what
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
what commission is this now well this is
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
the this would be the the group that
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
would be looking at this whole thing
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be this coordinating
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
Council that talking about exactly okay
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that up at the
 
03:57:08.189 --> 03:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
bottom of all this and and talk about
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
that so skipping over to number four is
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
it possible to create a merged system
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
and still provide autonomy for each
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
campus we've talked about that that's
 
03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
you've already asked that question have
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
we where y it was in one of the
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions that you you posed
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
Rick okay I can't remember it must been
 
03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
real late last night no you show me
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
where it is
 
03:57:35.309 --> 03:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
now well okay Jen I'll trust Jen yeah we
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
we've asked that
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
question but if it's not clear Jen could
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
maybe merge it into yeah something
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
earlier if you read something like that
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
Jen and you don't see it merge this in
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you number five what
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
should be the business model to maximize
 
03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
the resources of the current
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
systems what's meant by
 
03:58:03.389 --> 03:58:03.399 align:start position:0%
that Dave so it's it's really it's it
 
03:58:07.389 --> 03:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
that's the merger plan yeah yeah and so
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
so what you're what what you've what
 
03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
you've got right now is you're taking
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
two um separate um organizations and
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
merging them into into one organization
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
so there has to be a business plan for
 
03:58:22.750 --> 03:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
that and um and you know just like you
 
03:58:24.910 --> 03:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
would have if one company was buying you
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
know two companies were getting together
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
so by business model are you talking
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
about organizational
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
structure um not I'm not talking so much
 
03:58:35.950 --> 03:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
about that but it could certainly
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
include that um but uh but guess what
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
are the you know generally when when two
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
organizations are getting together the
 
03:58:48.630 --> 03:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the um the the sum is has has
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
greater value than the than the parts do
 
03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
separately and and so what what would
 
03:58:56.630 --> 03:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
what you know where does that value um
 
03:58:59.950 --> 03:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
stem from flow from and how how they
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
business okay is there any objection to
 
03:59:07.640 --> 03:59:09.149 align:start position:0%
business okay is there any objection to
that

03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
number five what should be the business
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
model to maximize the resources of the
 
03:59:13.880 --> 03:59:15.030 align:start position:0%
model to maximize the resources of the
current

03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
systems know what we just did that's
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
what we just did
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
six must be that Co shot oh yeah right
 
03:59:26.429 --> 03:59:26.439 align:start position:0%
how can a merg system guarantee that the
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
Community College voice does not get uh
 
03:59:29.399 --> 03:59:32.269 align:start position:0%
Community College voice does not get uh
subu

03:59:32.269 --> 03:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
subu
 
03:59:35.309 --> 03:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
subsumed uh by the larger University
 
03:59:37.630 --> 03:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
system we had something like yeah we had
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
that we've had we've we've asked that a
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
question we've asked that one that's
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's done okay number seven how can a
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
merger maximize the student centered
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
focus on their needs and those of the
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
economy of the
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
state yeah two questions there I think
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
we've asked that
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
question we we've talked a lot about
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
business and Pathways and Regional this
 
04:00:00.910 --> 04:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
and that exactly right well it's the
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
accommodating Market Market needs yeah
 
04:00:03.560 --> 04:00:04.830 align:start position:0%
accommodating Market Market needs yeah
yeah

04:00:04.830 --> 04:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.870 --> 04:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay this next one's kind of a a big one
 
04:00:15.149 --> 04:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh what would the administrative
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
management structure of a merge system
 
04:00:20.110 --> 04:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
look like there are a lot of options out
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
there yeah um for how you set your
 
04:00:23.120 --> 04:00:25.030 align:start position:0%
there yeah um for how you set your
governance

04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
governance
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
up a lot of different
 
04:00:27.800 --> 04:00:29.790 align:start position:0%
up a lot of different
models

04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
models
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 I don't think it is no it's
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
not Mike you have your hand fluttering
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
up no I'm just holding my head
 
04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
up he got the shot too yesterday's
 
04:00:45.399 --> 04:00:48.469 align:start position:0%
up he got the shot too yesterday's
fluttering

04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm wondering if this question
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a qualitative question
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
rather than ask what is ask what is the
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
most effective or most efficient or
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
something that's I like that better
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
other words they they're going to have
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
to look at them all and say okay what is
 
04:01:10.830 --> 04:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
the model which best F New Hampshire
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
that's good I like that too yeah it's a
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
good Mike I think you're leaning on
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
something on your keyboard I think so
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
too yeah let me uh I'll get out and try
 
04:01:23.710 --> 04:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
to get back in sorry okay okay no Oliver
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
I think that was a good that's a good
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
suggested what oliv Oliver do you want
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
to repeat for
 
04:01:37.239 --> 04:01:42.790 align:start position:0%
to repeat for
her

04:01:42.790 --> 04:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm sorry did were you asking
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
me to repeat yeah what you had proposed
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
so Jen get that down what is the
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh forgot what I said ideal or or most
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
efficient most
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
effective okay if you can get something
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
like that down Jen that'd be fine number
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
n how should a merger board of directors
 
04:02:10.960 --> 04:02:12.750 align:start position:0%
n how should a merger board of directors
be

04:02:12.750 --> 04:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
selected a merger
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
board so is that of
 
04:02:22.910 --> 04:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
the are you talking the Board of
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
Trustees here talking the fiduciary
 
04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
board yeah the fiduciary board so you're
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
talking about the new board that's the
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
so that so that board is different than
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
what you've been talking about Rick the
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
planning board I got that yeah about the
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
five five and five yeah y yep
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay number 10 I think we've talked
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
about that does a CEO structure fit we I
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
think we talked about the CEO process
 
04:03:06.670 --> 04:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
earlier so we're good there okay what
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
specific cost savings can be achieved
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
with a merger system ah there I think
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
we've got that in the business plan
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
question yeah we asked that question I
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
think we have in several places that's
 
04:03:19.389 --> 04:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
good we do yeah uh how does the
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
consolidation engage representation of
 
04:03:21.680 --> 04:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
consolidation engage representation of
each

04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
campus um there there's a couple other
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
campus related questions from the last
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
set and maybe this could be merged into
 
04:03:42.510 --> 04:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
well it's a legitimate question and if
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
we could just leave it there it's not g
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do any harm all right just leave it
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
there then yeah yeah okay how will
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
tuition levels be
 
04:03:59.229 --> 04:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
established board kind of an interesting
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you see is the University tuition
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
level going to drive the tuition level
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the Community College yeah you know I
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
think we asked that question Jen in
 
04:04:16.590 --> 04:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
another questions we did we talked about
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining levels and all that stuff so
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've already asked that
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
question okay I think we have
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
too I think we did that prior to Dave
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
getting here um
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
yeah okay number 14 how does one merge
 
04:04:33.309 --> 04:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
the various Information Technology
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
systems all that one we have not asked
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
we've not asked that and that was one of
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that Susan brought up on
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday from the multiple the
 
04:04:44.910 --> 04:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
university system their system and it is
 
04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
a com it is complex yeah Barber brought
 
04:04:50.910 --> 04:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
it up this morning too yeah yeah yeah
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay number
 
04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
15 should the current search for a new
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
Chancellor be postponed until a decision
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
is made on a new higher education
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
structure legitimate question yeah we've
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
heard that they're moving forward yeah
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
um both of them so so re related to this
 
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
so so what we heard from from Susan
 
04:05:15.229 --> 04:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
Huard was that they're moving forward
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
with an interim Chancellor for the
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
community college system um should there
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
be a parallel effort to move forward
 
04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
with an interim Chancellor for the
 
04:05:25.040 --> 04:05:27.950 align:start position:0%
with an interim Chancellor for the
University

04:05:27.950 --> 04:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
system so so so the the query is David
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
then is should they postpone the process
 
04:05:36.750 --> 04:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
or who's
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
name uh
 
04:05:40.830 --> 04:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
the the respective institutions should
 
04:05:44.429 --> 04:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
they should each one postpone or your
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
question should they hire an interim
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
during the during this planning period I
 
04:05:52.110 --> 04:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
so what right so what we heard from
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
Susan is that the community college
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
system interim is going to be singularly
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
focused no I don't want to say she said
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
that is is knows that that it's an
 
04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:04.469 align:start position:0%
that is is knows that that it's an
interim

04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
interim
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
role yeah right um
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
and and so so you know are there interim
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
roles and and can two interim
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
chancellors of the respective system
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
respective systems contribute to the um
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
U uh effort for a
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
merger well there's also the question
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
that I would I would perceive that the
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
budget for we may have one year where
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
you still have a budget that's for the
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
community college and a budet budget for
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
the higher education folks so oh yeah
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay now so are you going to need a
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
Chancellor yeah yeah yeah and
 
04:06:47.640 --> 04:06:50.830 align:start position:0%
Chancellor yeah yeah yeah and
and

04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.840 --> 04:06:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:06:53.710 --> 04:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
um I I I have no problem with leaving 15
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
there okay oh yeah yeah okay number 16
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
how can course alignment and credits
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
transferred uh be more effectively
 
04:07:11.309 --> 04:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
available for students we've asked that
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
question we've asked that question yep
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh what would the merger impact B on
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
various accreditations accreditation
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
currently available within each
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
institution I think we've asked that too
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
we've asked that question
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
yep okay what are the current
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration efforts within the
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
institution that that's an interesting
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
question we have not asked and and it
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned by Susan again in
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
her uh com comments about that there
 
04:07:41.469 --> 04:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
have been efforts of the respective
 
04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
schools to look at procurement Etc but
 
04:07:48.269 --> 04:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
that we have not asked this question yet
 
04:07:50.189 --> 04:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah see that's that that's exactly
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
right I've asked both chancellors that
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
that question how have you how are you
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
trying to coordinate you know between
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
the two and procurement is one that
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
they've been working on for several
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
years and they've looked at the issue of
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh of assimilating students going from
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
the year institution the fouryear
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
institution so we know those kind of
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
conversations have taken place so I I
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
think it's a question we should leave in
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
here yeah okay next one how are the
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
multiple collective bargaining
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
agreements to be merged oh wow here we
 
04:08:22.750 --> 04:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
are didn't we have something like that
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
yes we did yeah yeah the only the only
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing I would the only thing I would add
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
Jen to the previous questions we've had
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
on the collective bargaining I would add
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits and conditions of
 
04:08:37.630 --> 04:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
employment specifically because they are
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
are different with respective we when we
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
talked about the problem of leveling up
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
salaries where is the retirement system
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
come in and I think by just qualifying
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
that the CBA question is an important
 
04:08:54.149 --> 04:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
one to
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
do okay yeah that'd be fine Jen uh
 
04:08:57.760 --> 04:08:59.269 align:start position:0%
do okay yeah that'd be fine Jen uh
number

04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
20 how do you accommodate the
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
instructional qualifications of Staff
 
04:09:05.309 --> 04:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
serving the various campuses and student
 
04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
body accommodate the instruction
 
04:09:12.109 --> 04:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
qualifications I think the intent there
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
was remember the question I asked Susan
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday was the the the number of
 
04:09:19.520 --> 04:09:20.830 align:start position:0%
Wednesday was the the the number of
full-time

04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
faculty full-time instructors Visa that
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
of adjuncts and I mentioned that there
 
04:09:30.870 --> 04:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
are about 90 full-time at nhti I think
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
and 262 adjunct professors and the
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
question was how does that how does that
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
relate to the whole instructional and
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
quality and of of of
 
04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
instruction both at the at the community
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
college level Visa that at the uh
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
fouryear institutions whether or not
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
there's a change whether or not there's
 
04:09:56.349 --> 04:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
a the the qualifications for an adjunct
 
04:09:58.750 --> 04:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
for example is it different than it is
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
for an adjunct at Keen State because
 
04:10:05.309 --> 04:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
higher education is moving more and more
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
to adjunct professors now they've always
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
had had them they needed them because
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
you want people from who are
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners out in the field to come
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
in and do some teaching but one of the
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
dilemmas they've had in in um c
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
community college is that you've got
 
04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
adjuncts that are really full-time
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
professors or full-time instructors that
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
are teaching five sections for example
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
not just an occasional section so the
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
question I I had when I was thinking
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
about this was how does that relate to
 
04:10:39.389 --> 04:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
other in institutions throughout the
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the higher education
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
structure here in the
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
state I went on too much on that I'm
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
sorry well there there is some
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
legitimacy to the question or the the
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
the issue from the stpoint that an
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
adjunct at Keen may not be paid the same
 
04:11:02.830 --> 04:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know as the adjunct in PSU yeah
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
or or the adjunct in nhti y um
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
so that is it's getting down into the
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
negotiating stuff again but um it's it's
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
probably something that's going to have
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
to be looked at I don't know if it's
 
04:11:19.950 --> 04:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
necessary right from the top here it it
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
can stay in there I have no problem with
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
it but it's it's probably not going to
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
be addressed early on here yeah it's
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
probably one of those things to be you
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
know when it happens it happen exactly
 
04:11:32.189 --> 04:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
right I
 
04:11:36.030 --> 04:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
agree well let's leave it there uh how
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
can a merge system attract more New
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire high school graduates to
 
04:11:41.309 --> 04:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
become students in the system we've got
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we've got that number 22 how does a
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
merge system re respect the various
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
student profiles of each campus that
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
gets into the traditional student or you
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
know that's just coming back or the one
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
coming for a certificate
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
program or a badge as Oliver likes to
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
call it um
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh and Maron raised that question too
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
from a UNH perspective from a standpoint
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
of having people come back for a
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
specific kind of a training Visa you
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
know a degree program and how that's
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
going to get managed specifically as you
 
04:12:24.189 --> 04:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
begin to look at remote learning Etc and
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
options and whether or not that's a
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
whole new uh whole new market
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for higher education the
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
other concern I have with this one is
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we've heard many times the
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
education committee that 60% of the kids
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
coming into the community college system
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
need some form of remediation yeah of
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that you know many do not uh achieve
 
04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
success uh when I've asked the same
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
question to Mary Jane Steen when she was
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
there at PSU we don't have any remedial
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
problems we don't have remedial students
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
well that you know you know if we're
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to start merging some of this
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
together is that standard that the
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
community college has now now going to
 
04:13:07.960 --> 04:13:09.109 align:start position:0%
community college has now now going to
be

04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
changed and are we going to see more
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
kids refuse the opportunity to try to go
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
education um are we going to lose the
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
services to support the
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
remediation uh that are provided now and
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
we've had different ways according to
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
when we've talked with Shannon before
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
and how those are delivered in Beth
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
question is there any objections to
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair there's another wrinkle to
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
that as well some of the community
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
colleges initially took courses and
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
broke them into fractions and so what
 
04:13:53.229 --> 04:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
was three credits at the University was
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
nine credits at the uh Community College
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
because they broke it into thirds as a
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
sort of approach to developmental headed
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so they they took them where they
 
04:14:05.469 --> 04:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
were and brought them forward but they
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
gave them more credit for it then the
 
04:14:10.109 --> 04:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
university would have given and so
 
04:14:11.550 --> 04:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that gets
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
worked out in the department sitting
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
down with the course descriptions and
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
trying to me measure it all out that's
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
just another part of the problem what
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
you just said Oliver I didn't have a hot
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
clue about and what you're what you're
 
04:14:29.070 --> 04:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
saying is that's from knowing what
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
happens in there you've seen it you've
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
worked with it and that's why it's
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
important that I think we have people
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
that are thoroughly knowledgeable that
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
when they're starting to look at this
 
04:14:41.790 --> 04:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
stuff I would miss something like
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
that yeah well we didn't realize it
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
either until we finally quietly asked
 
04:14:49.149 --> 04:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
them around the table uh you know was
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
this you know done to you know meet the
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
student and and eventually they owned up
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
to admitting that they had literally
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
taken our course with a pair of scissors
 
04:15:01.389 --> 04:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
and cut the the definitions into a third
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
each and made each one a three credit
 
04:15:04.239 --> 04:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
each and made each one a three credit
course

04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
course
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay you learn something every day
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so next one um so we're
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
leaving that
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
there uh number 23 what would the
 
04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh Integrity impact of the
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
curtailment of certain programs courses
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
within the system what would be the
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
Integrity impact of the C who can you
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
explain that one Mel yeah I think the
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
the issue here was that if you were to
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
cut a particular ular program this kind
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
of goes back to what Michael was talking
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
about earlier if if you cut a particular
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
program out of of the
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum what impact does that have on
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
the on the on the other part of the
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
program for example let's take a
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
business CL Business program if you were
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
to if you to say okay we don't we're
 
04:15:58.950 --> 04:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
gonna cut this program out of the
 
04:15:58.960 --> 04:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
gonna cut this program out of the
business

04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:16:03.710 --> 04:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum what impact might that cut
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
have on the rest of the of the business
 
04:16:09.630 --> 04:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
program would it maintain its Integrity
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of quality Etc I'm not
 
04:16:15.870 --> 04:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
wetted I'm not wetted to number 23 but
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
it was when we begin talking about
 
04:16:22.109 --> 04:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
cutting stuff uh because of uh uh
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
student enrollment or cost Etc it was
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
just in my mind was what impact is that
 
04:16:30.750 --> 04:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
going to have on the merits of that
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
particular program within a school or
 
04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
within a
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
institution I'm not W yeah I I I I think
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
we could Pro probably I mean that that's
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
already within the the the um you know
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
purview of the college presidents yeah
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay so we can cut we don't have to
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
worry about that one we got enough how
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
does a flagship section I'm trying to
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
rush because I'm trying to get done yeah
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
I the reason the reason why I raised
 
04:16:57.109 --> 04:16:57.119 align:start position:0%
this one was what we found in
 
04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
Connecticut when we discovered that the
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
University of Connecticut is not part of
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the total Connecticut higher education
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
system it's a part and so that was that
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
was what kind of in my mind raised the
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
red flag on what's that what does that
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
mean when you've got you know UNH right
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
now Browns it Brands itself as the
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
premier um research institution in the
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
state how does that then reflect to all
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
the other schools that would be in the
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
system again I'm not wetted to that one
 
04:17:28.750 --> 04:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
it was just a thought that was in my
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
mind that came across my notes as I was
 
04:17:33.149 --> 04:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
referring it so Mel maybe we want to
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
cast that another way though um and
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we can lift some language
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
from the I think it was the enms uh
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
report that that did have some careful
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
consideration for merging systems where
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
one of the systems included a research
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
University do you remember that Rick
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I do remember that
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the idea of the what Mel
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
said though here where the
 
04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
flagship is seen as something special so
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to it's a research
 
04:18:13.870 --> 04:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
center and there's so it's not cons it's
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's a separate entity within the system
 
04:18:16.720 --> 04:18:18.109 align:start position:0%
it's a separate entity within the system
yeah

04:18:18.109 --> 04:18:18.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it it's all goes underneath how
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to structure and organize
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
your system um it's like the
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth system down in h
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania you know well relates too
 
04:18:34.349 --> 04:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
to what Don was saying about how P State
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
created their Innovation section
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
and you know how does if you're in a big
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
system does that mean that that kind of
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
creative stuff goes to the flagship or
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
does it does is there allow for it to be
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the other institutions within that
 
04:18:54.750 --> 04:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
system I think that if you were to talk
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
to pilou State now and they're talking
 
04:18:58.030 --> 04:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
about the cluster program and the
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
research they're having every Department
 
04:19:00.439 --> 04:19:01.349 align:start position:0%
research they're having every Department
do

04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
now uh and some of them are doing it
 
04:19:05.469 --> 04:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
with local community organizations some
 
04:19:07.469 --> 04:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
are doing it with business
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think research should be
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
contained just to one institution well
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
but that's my question yeah what does it
 
04:19:16.269 --> 04:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
mean to have a flagship Visa the others
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
we don't spend any we don't need that we
 
04:19:21.269 --> 04:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
don't need it okay let's let's you know
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
and we've already answered 25 is we've
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
already already answered
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
that and the 26 is on the back so how
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
would a merger system meet the regional
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
and Statewide needs of and we we've
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
we've asked that question we've asked
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
that question so now we are down to um
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear my two-year-old it's time
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
for a nap out there good it's time for
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
nap for me I don't know about you guys
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm getting there
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
myself I think Mike with his covid shot
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
Mike all right I I I know I look
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
terrible and it is co it's not there's
 
04:20:09.309 --> 04:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
nothing else I mean I don't have Co I
 
04:20:12.990 --> 04:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
had a CO shot I know it you got the
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
wrong shot you should have gone where I
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
got mine yeah you're pretty pretty good
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
Rick okay so so now we're trying to
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
focus on what the uh collaborative I can
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
speak to what I think is going to happen
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
with uh uh hb2 and this is just all
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
conjecture I would I would say at this
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
point in time that there is probably
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to be some concern conc ER about
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh how the mission of the Community
 
04:20:42.040 --> 04:20:42.990 align:start position:0%
uh how the mission of the Community
College

04:20:42.990 --> 04:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
College
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
systems are may be impacted by this and
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
a desire to move slowly until there's
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
guarantees you know more understanding
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
um so this is what why I think you're
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
going to see come out of u a division to
 
04:21:03.309 --> 04:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
a request for slowing it down and
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
establishing a coordinating Council
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
um which would be I don't know how
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be developing the folks
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
that are on that I I think the it might
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
come from you know both sides of the the
 
04:21:21.389 --> 04:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
system both
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
systems uh I would maybe make a
 
04:21:31.149 --> 04:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion that it also allow for um
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
um those people that like Barbara
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
Brenham mentioned today there might be
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
some special to come in with I've heard
 
04:21:42.109 --> 04:21:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mike Moffett talk about you know John
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
Lynch for example uh I've heard uh
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
myself talk about Ed McKay for example
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
um there there there are people out
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
there that have certain expertise that
 
04:21:56.189 --> 04:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
from a historical perspective even
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
though they may not have been there in
 
04:21:59.109 --> 04:21:59.119 align:start position:0%
the last three or four years they
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
certainly are aware how it works um so I
 
04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
I I I don't want to really spell out for
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
them that the council must be this this
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
and this one of this one of that and
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
everything else yeah uh I'd rather that
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
it just recognized we're in this
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
business to try to slow it down to look
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
at these considerations that we've just
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
identified here and and when they move
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
forward to fund this and do this they're
 
04:22:29.149 --> 04:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
doing it with the understanding that
 
04:22:30.910 --> 04:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
they've also looked at our policy
 
04:22:33.149 --> 04:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations or
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts agreed take care steps to do it
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah and I think I think it's
 
04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
important too Rick that they recognize
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
that this coordinating group is going to
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
need some funding that just to kind of
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
bring a bunch of Volunteers in without
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
the resources to bring in some of the
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
experts because I think one of the
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
things that that britam really
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
emphasized this morning was the need to
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
know what is but also to be out there to
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
bring people in that can say what could
 
04:23:06.429 --> 04:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
be in a way so that we don't get hung up
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
and just trying to uh to Resh Shuffle
 
04:23:12.870 --> 04:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
the chairs on the on a deck of a sinking
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
ship here that we need to be able to
 
04:23:17.149 --> 04:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
look forward as well as understand where
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
we are right now and that's going to
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
take some that's going to take some
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
funding um yeah I think that some some
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the folks perhaps you you probably
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
could utilize if they're already
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
employed by the university system or the
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
community college system but you may
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
need to bring some specialists in as was
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
suggested today and and and have some
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
advice as to what Vermont's doing or
 
04:23:41.149 --> 04:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
what Maine's doing or what massachusett
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
or Connecticut has done um to try and
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
get some insights so we we try to make
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
the best decision that we can I know to
 
04:23:52.030 --> 04:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
make a buck you got to spend a buck um
 
04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
and we and we do we do have people
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
within the system that have worked in
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
other systems I mean you've got you know
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
the president of nhti for example came
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
from Connecticut she has some experience
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
Don has experiences so I think you're
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
right there are we need to identify
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
folks within the system that have worked
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
outside that have that experience that
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
can share what they've learned from
 
04:24:17.469 --> 04:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
their just just a correction there Mel
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
gret Gretchen came from Pittsburgh oh
 
04:24:22.030 --> 04:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
from I'm sorry yeah but but but
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely re relevant to the
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania discussion um that's right
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
she's part of the Commonwealth system we
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
had yeah and we've got Dr um Katherine
 
04:24:35.070 --> 04:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
Addie out at great um Great Bay from
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
Connecticut there are a whole host of
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
people that are knowledgeable that we
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
have right here in our own State and
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
this is a i I'd rather see us use people
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
and invite the specialist in if we need
 
04:24:52.590 --> 04:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
that but to know our state um so I think
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
that there also ought to be a
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
requirement written in this
 
04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation that there be a a flight
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
path towards the goal wherever we're
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
going that goal of merge but there has
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be reports benchmarks along the way
 
04:25:12.189 --> 04:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
where there's reporting back
 
04:25:14.109 --> 04:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:25:16.349 --> 04:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislature the whether it's the higher
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
education St study commission or it's
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
back to the education Committee of the
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house uh or back to the
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
speaker and the president uh there has
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
to be some kind of a report um coming
 
04:25:32.590 --> 04:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
back so that it just doesn't happen and
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we hear here's the
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
outcome and
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
you know I think we need to be kept
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
informed yeah okay hey Rick can you hear
 
04:25:44.189 --> 04:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
me yeah I can I know we're just asking
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
questions here not making
 
04:25:47.109 --> 04:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations but I would ask the
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
question should an independent
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan committee be established to
 
04:25:54.429 --> 04:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
make recommendations and offer options
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason I say that I mean like
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
you just said there are many many
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful people in both systems who can
 
04:26:04.670 --> 04:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
give wonderful expertise but uh if they
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
are part of the decision-making process
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
it would be fatally flawed I think
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
because if you have University system
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
people making recommendations or
 
04:26:16.349 --> 04:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
Community cstem people making official
 
04:26:18.030 --> 04:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations they're going to
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
inevitably I think uh you know uh Veer
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
towards their own com uh system so I and
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I go back to the the Brack thing that
 
04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
did work for base closures uh so it's a
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
question that I would ask because we're
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
not making recommendations should an
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
independent on part
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
committee be generated to offer options
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I I I'd like to respond to
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
that I think that you know I'll just
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
bring it down right to the local level
 
04:26:53.950 --> 04:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
when when I served as chair of the
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
select board here we had five different
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
select board members all from different
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
but at that time they all were working
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the common good of the
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
community and I never once heard well
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's not good for my precinct so I'm not
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to vote for that I have enough
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
faith I I believe in uh the
 
04:27:18.269 --> 04:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
representation that would be put forward
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
from either by Susan Huard or by kathern
 
04:27:24.990 --> 04:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
preventure which you know we got to
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
understand that this shouldn't be
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
politics but we need to have people that
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
are clearly going to willing to get on
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
as this committee has right
 
04:27:37.229 --> 04:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
here um I haven't heard politics here
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard issues and they're
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
all legitimate issues and considerations
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
and concerns I think it can happen it
 
04:27:46.109 --> 04:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
should happen I'm going to lose faith in
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
our system if we know that the people we
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
have are so oriented around UNH that
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to protect UNH rather than
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
protecting the whole all the students in
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
this state I think Susan and Karen are
 
04:28:01.229 --> 04:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful I think everybody that is
 
04:28:03.309 --> 04:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
involved with us are wonderful maybe
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd be fine uh but I know that
 
04:28:08.670 --> 04:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
if you've immersed yourself in one
 
04:28:10.469 --> 04:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
system you understand and you're
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
invested and understand that system it's
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to be hard not to advocate for
 
04:28:18.030 --> 04:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
that system uh I mean it's just human
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
nature maybe it'll be fine but I I worry
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
about I think that's maybe for me the
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
biggest question is is uh what people
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
are going to uh get into the weeds and
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
make the the tough
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations one of one of the things
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been mentioned Rick is the
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
need for Staffing of this uh
 
04:28:39.309 --> 04:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
collaborative group uh because as as we
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
we know it takes time to arrange for
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
people to attend meetings taking notes
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
of the meetings I mean Lord knows the
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
amount of time Jen has spent working
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
with the various committees in this
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
remote in this remote process and let's
 
04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
let's face it we're g to have to do this
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
in a remote way and as we found on the
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh the school funding
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
commission it it is was a huge task to
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
staff this thing to make sure everything
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
was ready to go and and all that so that
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
the whoever is the chair of the
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative group uh doesn't have to
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
spend their time making those
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
arrangements so I would add to the
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
comments to division two the issue of
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing is important now whether it's
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
done with the current uh the current
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
research folks that's not our decision
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
but some staffing decisions need to be
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
provided for well wouldn't that be with
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
the transitional monies we've been
 
04:29:38.189 --> 04:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
talking about yes that that could be
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
part of it that that would be supportive
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
of that whole effort and this like we've
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
talked before you got to spend a buck to
 
04:29:48.309 --> 04:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
make a buck exactly right but by the way
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
just just for the information of the
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
group I just got notification that up
 
04:29:52.800 --> 04:29:55.149 align:start position:0%
group I just got notification that up
until

04:29:55.149 --> 04:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:29:58.590 --> 04:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
2013 the chancellor all the presidents
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the colleges reported to the
 
04:30:04.109 --> 04:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
chancellor up until
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
2013 just what I had heard too that
 
04:30:10.030 --> 04:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I think edit told
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
me okay all right okay Mr chairman Mr
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
chairman could I raise one other issue
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes I think we would be somewhat remiss
 
04:30:22.950 --> 04:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
if we didn't take this opportunity to
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
somehow either ask as a question or
 
04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
invite the existing school systems
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
universities community colleges all of
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
them to begin the process of exploring
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
how their their course descriptions
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
might be brought into um parallel with
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
each one another for purposes of
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
facilitating transfer students good
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
point it's a process they're going to
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
have to do anyway at some point and if
 
04:30:56.269 --> 04:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
we invite them then we take the step of
 
04:30:59.309 --> 04:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
taking this process into a slightly
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
forward stepping mode where they're
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
doing something they're going to need to
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
do anyway and and it doesn't really cost
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
them all that
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
much more time in committees and talking
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
to each
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
other I think that's a very legitimate
 
04:31:19.109 --> 04:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
consideration uh that that's exactly
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
what Pennsylvania has
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
done so if you take a a course at the
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
school that Don Burks was at out in Erie
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania it would be the same course
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
as at Penn
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
State question about it applying to all
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
the programs to which you might be
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
admitted if you
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
transfer yeah within that system yes yes
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
with that that's what I was referring to
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
earlier that I think that's that's an
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
area that that the two systems could get
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
a jump start on on that now they don't
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
have to wait till they're merge to to do
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
that yeah and it would answer one of the
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
demands we're hearing from our
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
constituents yeah yeah you know it's
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
inter just as a side note if you look at
 
04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Defense
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
schools if a kid is going to a school in
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
inch on South Korea and transfers to
 
04:32:19.950 --> 04:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
vbot in Germany in the fifth grade he's
 
04:32:23.309 --> 04:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
had he has the same courses as they do
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're Universal and by the way
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
the kids in the dod schools they all
 
04:32:31.030 --> 04:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
score in the top when you start when you
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
start doing it but they've got a
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
universal program and I think what what
 
04:32:37.790 --> 04:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
what Oliver is saying hm why can't we do
 
04:32:39.630 --> 04:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
that in higher education
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
so certainly we could begin with the one
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
under level 200 level and move up the
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
lot yeah it gets complicated at the top
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
I know okay Jen you had you said you had
 
04:32:51.630 --> 04:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
to get out of here by 2:30 I'm looking
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
at the clock wall here yeah I've got to
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
get out um but I do have um Pam smling
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
has joined the call um and so she'll be
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
able to help you with anything Technical
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
and um we'll get any notes back to me
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that is necessary um I can also
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
give you a call about 4:45 repr Vlad if
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
that's okay to kind of sure when you

of that okay which I'm not prepared to

do in a public meeting okay I just I
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
just think that do you want uh uh do you
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
want some members of the committee to be
 
04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
there with you as you present this to
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
the uh division two yeah what I'll have
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
to do is find out when they are doing
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
this section of
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
H2 um I I I I the support would be
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
really welcomed um I think it's would be
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
great if they can see that this report
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
is coming from a committee which was you
 
04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
know very uh nonpolitical yeah uh we
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
were looking at at kids and the
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
postsecondary systems and and all
 
04:36:05.551 --> 04:36:05.561 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's Plus and
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
minuses and um just want to do things in
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
a fashion which is you know going to be
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
a lasting fashion rather than do it a
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
year or two and then have a a problem
 
04:36:20.349 --> 04:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
right okay Rick I I I'm not sure this is
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
