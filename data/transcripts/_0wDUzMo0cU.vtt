support of the
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
bill um first you may notice it's a long
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
bill it's only a long bill because we
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
have to replace the same phrase
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the statute um the phrase
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
being division of children youth and
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
families to the Department of Children
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Youth and families effectively this what
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
eight page bill or so nine-page bill um
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
10 page bill
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
is taking what is currently a very large
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department buried within
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS um last count that I have from
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
house finance was roughly 775 positions
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
within this
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
department you uh I saw that the
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner is here um or the
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioners here you might
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
get a better
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
number of the roughly 5,000 employees
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
within that department or 4,000 sorry
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
3,000 employees within that department
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
this is almost 25% of
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS it is outside
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the rest of
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
DHHS and potentially the dep some of the
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety um including
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
Corrections probably the biggest
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
department in the state yet
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
organizationally it is buried two levels
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
organizationally it is buried two levels
below

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
almost three levels
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
below someone who would report to the
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
governor and executive counsel
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
directly so Department of Safety has a
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
direct report to the to the um executive
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
Council and Governor DHHS has a direct
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
report um as well as the the second
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
tiers or effectively direct reports to
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council however we have
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and then underneath
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would be an associate commissioner
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
and then underneath that becomes the
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
director for
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
DCF um I'm going to turn in an
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
organization chart so people understand
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the department I can also
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
turn in um some documentation if you
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
guys are interested showing the number
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
of employees in the department
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
underneath the director of DC what how
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
many copies do you have I have 20 would
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
you like some eventually yeah okay thank
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
you I would say hand them to the one
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
nearest you but that's me so I get it so
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
I will also if you're interested hand in
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of pages I can get these
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
printed out before I leave that show and
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
I can email them electronically show the
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
number of employees in the department so
 
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.310 align:start position:0%
number of employees in the department so
underneath

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
DCF um there is the cunu center which is
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
a large group of people um the cunu
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
center is about 130 people there is also
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
foster care there is child placement
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
Services there there's a number of
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
different departments when all is said
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
and done in child prot ction
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
Services um I think there's over 500
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
people if I can find the page in this um
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
um Child Protection Services are
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
cycle

00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
we've had a high couple of high-profile
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
cases in the last couple of years I
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
think we could nickname this the harmony
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
Montgomery bill I bring up her name
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
because here's a a perfectly good
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
example of the unfortunate part about
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
not having the necessary transparency
 
00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:17.230 align:start position:0%
not having the necessary transparency
within

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
government who do you go to if you can't
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
find the and get access to the direct
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor easily in a case that's not
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
being addressed in correctly or their
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor or how many ever layers
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
between that person and the
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
director people know who their executive
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
counselor is if they have a problem they
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
can reach out to their executive
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
counselor and say hey I I'm not getting
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
the attention we need there there
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
there's clearly an issue my son or
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
daughter is not getting the protective
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
services that they
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
need I want you to look in into this and
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
that executive counselor can easily pick
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
up the phone and make a call and find
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
out what's going
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
on to some extent that can be done
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
through State reps and State Senators
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
but not as
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
effectively obviously all of these cases
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
are highly confidential which makes it
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
hard to deal with what do you do about
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
sharing this information um with a an
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
elected official and maybe we need to
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
create a car out such that a small group
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
of people like the executive Council
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
information could be shared with so that
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
the executive council members um each
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
one who represents 20% of the state can
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
calls what we see is an issue today of
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
inappropriate triage of cases and
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
insufficient resources in cases that
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
need help and overuse of resources in
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
cases that should be
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
dismissed every case where resources are
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
put State resources are put chasing the
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
wrong family we're short changing the
 
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
kid who needs
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
kid who needs
[Music]

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
help we don't need another Haron in
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
Montgomery at the end of the day um the
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
fact that two years went by in that case
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
or 18 months shows that there's some big
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
gaps in this department and while I
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the department has in
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to Link services
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
from within DCF to some of the other
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
Visions within
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS the reality is there's some major
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
structural gaps need to be addressed and
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
the best way to address this is to have
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
the transparency that would happen if
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
the department was by
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
itself so in that sense it's a
 
00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
itself so in that sense it's a
housekeeping

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
bill I there's probably people in the
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
audience behind me who would not say
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
moving a department out to it to its own
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
division would be or a division out to
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
its own Department would be a
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill but at some
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
level all we're doing there's no dollars
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
associated with it all we're moving is a
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
group of people who do not have any
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
direct oversight via the executive
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
branch to a department from a division
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
to a department that actually does have
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
direct oversight by the executive
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
branch um in terms of the fiscal note I
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
will comment um there was a line in here
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
about needing to buy additional
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
equipment computers infrastructure
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
office Etc um obviously these people
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
have cubicles and equipment today I
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that in that
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't necessarily be allocated to
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
their new facility just changing the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
reporting structure doesn't require us
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
to buy new infrastructure new
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
computers um it might mean a transfer of
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
assets at some level I'm not even saying
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
the department couldn't be collocated
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
within DHHS for the purpose purpose
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
of of housing all we're trying to do at
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
this level is make sure that there's
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
some executive oversight of this
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
department so we don't have another
 
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.710 align:start position:0%
department so we don't have another
Harmony

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
Harmony
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
Montgomery um with that I'll close my
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
testimony unfortunately the prime
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor couldn't be here relative to
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
child care and and weather related stuff
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I am pinch itting for her today I
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
think that's it may I ask a question
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.710 align:start position:0%
think that's it may I ask a question
absolutely

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
I see that greater accessibility and
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
availability is always a good goal and I
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
know that as chairman of DHHS
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
oversight I have the honor of hearing a
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
report each month from the commissioner
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
of DHHS or the
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
deputy but anytime I want to hear from
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
DCF I just ask for the director to be
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
scheduled and the director is there I do
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
this with Mr Lipman from Medicaid and
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
all the different agencies within
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS and what difference would it make
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
for me or indeed any representative
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
calling up the director uh by moving the
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
director into being a commissioner so in
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
that case it wouldn't make a difference
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
the issue is in in the child protective
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
statutes um either for good reasons or
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
bad these are highly confidential cases
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of them right to have 700
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
almost 800 employees this is a
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
significantly a significant Department
 
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
size by no means am I saying we don't
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
need these Services what I'm saying is
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
we need better oversight of these
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
services and
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
allowing maybe allowing in the statutes
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
that information could be shared with
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
with a small select few meaning
 
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.870 align:start position:0%
with a small select few meaning
executive

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
counsel you can bring up a confidential
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
case as a parent with an elected
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
official today the way the statutes are
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
written it's really hard to deal with
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
that you could theoretically bring it up
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
um an active case with
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
um and we could make the changes to the
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
statutes there to bring it up with your
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
state representative so your state
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative could in fact call the
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
director of DCF
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
um last year in a sorry two years ago in
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
a bill we were able to make the change
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
from a criminal misdemeanor level P
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
penalty meaning potentially facing jail
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
time for sharing confidential
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
information to making it a violation
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
such that if if it was important enough
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
to risk the violation you could at least
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
start the dialogue with an elected
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
official today the average parent
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that option because Because
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
unless they're willing to face an
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
expense of violation there is no way for
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
them to share this information with an
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
elected official to get the help they
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
need could that not be put in a bill to
 
00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
make that happen irrespective of whether
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
DCF is in an agency of DHHS or a
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
separate um Department
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is a positive change
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm not disagreeing with that
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is this is one
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
Department that's several tiers down
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
from the executive Council and the
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
governor unlike the other Departments of
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
equal size DHHS is a really large
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
department when you have really large
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
departments unfortunately it leads to
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
some net inefficiencies now it is good
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
um that let's say DCF needs is working
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
family and they need additional benefits
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
through one of the other child benefit
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
programs because of um because the
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
family doesn't have enough income or
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
something the fact that that information
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
can be shared internally to help them
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
get the the resources is great that is
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
today the way it's
 
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
today the way it's
structured

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
however because of the confidentiality
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
and because of where it is located
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
within D
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
DHHS we have this Gap where there's
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
insufficient transparency to
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
operations and greater transparency
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
leads to Greater government
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
performance once again could that
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
transparency not be uh better built into
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
what we have now as DCF as we all know
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
continues to improve from where it
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
was absolutely and and and maybe I
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
believe the Deputy Commissioner might be
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
testifying um think
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
smiling so I assume she'll she will step
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
up to testify she filled out a pin card
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
so she can testify she can testify uh I
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
believe there are potentially
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
transparency reforms the issue and I
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
would make the argument every case
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
available at the same level it would in
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
terms of information that it would be if
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
it had been filed with the Supreme Court
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
so you guys may not see a bunch of
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
information that goes to the Supreme
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
Court but in a Supreme Court
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
case um let's say there's a child abuse
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
case involving a minor right they're
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
only using initials there's certain
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
information that is prohibited but they
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
do allow some level of content of what's
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
going on unfortunately that level of
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
content is not available today I would
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
be all in favor of figuring out how to
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
create some sort of structure to allow
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
greater transparency within the
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
department what I don't want to see is a
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
family who's complaining or a mom who's
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
complaining about a child not getting
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
the time or attention that they need and
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
It Go for for 18
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
months likewise on the other side I
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a family complaining
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
about hey my child is
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
fine but there's a house down the street
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
where there's rampant drug abuse and
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
those children aren't aren't get are are
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
being neglected aren't getting the time
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
and attention you need but you're
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
focusing on my children who are doing
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
really well right same town that
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
testimony happened um last week or two
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
weeks ago my point is there are issues
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
and coming from the engineering world I
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
would call it or engineeringmedical
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
world I would call it triage at the end
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the day figuring out how to vet cases
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
well is a tough thing I'm not I'm not
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
trying to minimize that task at all it
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
well however I do believe that greater
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability to the
 
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.549 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability to the
executive

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
branch is where some of that those
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
reforms Could Happen which is why we
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
have other major departments reporting
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
directly up to the executive counsel and
 
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.070 align:start position:0%
directly up to the executive counsel and
the

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
governor this one does not um one of the
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions was asked was relative to the
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
funding of the directorship right and
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
what the position yeah we can figure out
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
an appropriate position within the St
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
salary classification codes financial
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
aid right comparable to whatever the
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
current pay is but because the director
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
is now somebody who's nominated and
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the executive Council there
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
is some level of authority in in that
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
reporting structure that is greater than
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything today so to answer your
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
question at the highest level by putting
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
the direct link between the executive
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
Council of the governor and the head of
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
dcyf I believe we're going to see the
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
reforms we need thank you any further
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
representative

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:57.799 --> 00:25:59.070 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr chairman
representative

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
H specific to what you testified earlier
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
that the inappropriate triage of cases
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
to provide resources to investigate
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
cases so they don't go in the wrong
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
direction do we not or is based your
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
statement today is we do not have the
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
resources to do the job correctly in the
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
first place under the current structure
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
no we misappropriate resources today so
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
there is insufficient resources to
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
address the actual cases because of an
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
effort of focus and triage and some
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
cases get excessive effort that
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen follow up Mr chair
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
follow up then specific to that are the
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
people that you're referring to not
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
trained to do the job that they are
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
do I'm not sure if it's training or bias
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm too far removed I and and in all
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
fairness right you may or may not be
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
aware of my personal case so I there's a
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
certain inherent bias right from what I
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
saw but I can tell you the department
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
spent four months chasing a case that
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
could have been solved in 18
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
hours and that's four months with
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
multiple attorneys and multiple people
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
and 300 Pages worth of Discovery and
 
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.630 align:start position:0%
and 300 Pages worth of Discovery and
whatever

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
else they spent time on none of which
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
needed that tells me there's a
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
management issue not at the senior level
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the side that's fine
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's a middle ma a middle management
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
level issue somewhere between the casew
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
worker and maybe the branch supervisor
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
or manager right so we have the Conway
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the conquered and the Manchester
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
branches somewhere between maybe that
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
branch manager and
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
down is where the issue is having spoke
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
having spoken with several attorneys who
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
deal with dcyf cases on on a regularity
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
they can tell which branches or which
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever conquer Division versus Conway
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
Division versus Manchester they can tell
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
which divisions perform better than
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
others just by the just by the clients
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
that they end up seeing and by the
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
information coming through the case so
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
some of those divisions do really well
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
and some do
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
not any further questions representative
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
McMahon yes
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman there it is
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
again I'll be redundant thank you Mr
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairman that's okay I thought I'd
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
stipulate that when I said it the first
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
time consider yourself stipulated thank
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
you your honor okay it's under appeal
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sure indeed it is the uh the issue
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to go after here it's I've being
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
on the oversight Committee in my career
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
here over 20 years is that we found uh
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
that a quick response takes place when
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee is made aware of
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the subject matter and they already have
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
a due process authority to call the
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
authorities having jurisdiction to come
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
in front of them if we um that being
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
said is that also not being uh exploited
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
to facilitate doing the right thing as
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
you as you state performance for our
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
citizens so so um if I may I I I'm not
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
sure exploited is the right word so let
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
me offer uh taken advantage of right in
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
terms of that the citizens are aware of
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
this and reach out to you guys I don't
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
think that information is out there so
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
that may be one of the things that comes
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
out of this is to make sure this group
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
of people the oversight committee
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
is available their contact information
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
is provided so that when a citizen says
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
Hey time out I've got a problem right
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
either end of the
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
spectrum it's a Continuum that they know
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
who to reach out to I can tell you
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
personally after my my
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
um series of events with dcyf in
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
starting in 2021 after that case was
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
public and in the press and closed I had
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
17 phone calls from from parents who
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
felt like they weren't getting the help
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
they need or they were a victim of an
 
00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:04.669 align:start position:0%
they need or they were a victim of an
aggressive

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
Department that's a lot of phone
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
calls any other questions U one last one
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman why
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
not relative to the fiscal note when it
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
states the department uh on the last
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
page repo yep says does not provide for
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
the transfer of certain
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
staff uh my question is can we
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
facilitate what we have as
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
Resources with with additional Direction
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
and job description to meet the service
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
requirements that you are that well that
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
are represented in the
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill so there are a lot of ways to do
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
this um relative to that footnote about
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of non DCF staff as I am aware
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
there are I believe 33 attorney
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
positions reporting through the office
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner not directly
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
underneath the department the director
 
00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.549 align:start position:0%
underneath the department the director
of

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
DCF those attorneys handle a lot of the
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
casework some of which might be for DHHS
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
some of which is all is DCF related um
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the Deputy Commissioner can better
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that I believe that's the
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
positions they're talking about but I
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm willing to try and figure
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
out how to make that group as well I
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
believe that department needs the legal
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
support a lot of cases get tossed into
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
the legal domain maybe
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
prematurely um and it just takes at some
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
level right we are taking people that
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
are case workers when they run into a
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
road block it goes up to an attorney
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
especially if if you get an attorney
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
involved early in the case so I think
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
that is the positions they're referring
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
to but I I better I can't answer because
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you sir thank you Mr
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
chairman you're welcome representative B
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you I'd say
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
good morning but I don't agree with
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
that um you had brought up a couple of
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
times Harmony Montgomery and I came a
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
little late so I apologize for that sure
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so how would this bill help a case
 
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.750 align:start position:0%
um so how would this bill help a case
like

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
that so the issue is today a citizen
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't know where to turn um I think
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
you miss missed it I will be handing out
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the organization chart right the the
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
director report you haven't seen it yet
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
the director reports to the associate
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the associate
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioners reports up to the
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner right so there is no
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
published org chart so when Jane Doe
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
case worker stops at your door and says
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
hey I've got I I want to work with you
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
and the parent doesn't feel like they're
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
getting a response it's not clear who
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
they call after that at some level we
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
could deal with that with a policy right
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
that um here's my business card I'm a
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a case worker here's my direct
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
supervisor right and that information is
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
shared so if you don't like what I'm
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
doing call my direct supervisor
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately none of that information
 
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
unfortunately none of that information
is

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
available I do believe there are issues
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
where people aren't getting the response
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
they need so unfortunately the mom in
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
the in the harmony Montgomery case never
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
got the response she needed she wrote
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
all the way up through the mayor of
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester and fell on deaf ears I don't
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
want to see that I want to make sure
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's someone in the executive branch
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
who you can pick up the phone and this
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
is to the point earlier well there's an
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that people can call
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
today I've been a State Rep this is my
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
ninth year I didn't know that until
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
today so if I didn't know that I'm
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
pretty certain out of the 1.3 million
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire that's a small
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
group of people who are aware of the
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of DCF and DHHS so
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
something that comes positive out of
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is greater publicity about there's
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
another way to reach out to someone
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
who's an elected official to get the
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
help thank you did I answer your
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
question yes it does this is a problem
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
to me that's in search of a solution and
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes one solution
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
educating the executive Council and all
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
the state reps whom to go
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
to is another solution that is other
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
than separating out a whole uh agency
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
from a department would you agree that
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
is a possible solution absolutely I the
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
reason I think this is this is warranted
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about a budget that's
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
$150 million it's not an insignificant
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
amount of money each year okay in terms
 
00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.149 align:start position:0%
amount of money each year okay in terms
of

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
resources it oversees important
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
functions like foster care it oversees
 
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.470 align:start position:0%
functions like foster care it oversees
important

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
functions um child placement functions
 
00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:54.990 align:start position:0%
functions um child placement functions
if

00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
necessary these are important things
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
when this is the one case where
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
government intrudes within the the
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
family structure in a significant way
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
more so than any other place in
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
government yet it is it's not its own
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
Department reporting up to the governor
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
and executive counsel it's buried down
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
below an existing structure there is no
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
other way to create the transparency
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
this might be the sledgehammer to
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
solving the problem I'm willing to
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there might be lots of
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
changes between this request
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
and what right and what could be done to
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
improve transparency but clearly there
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
is a transparency need and an
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
accountability need that has not been
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
addressed on both ends of the spectrum
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
harming Montgomery for lack of
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
resources myself and 17 other families
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
on the other end yeah we're now
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
repeating ourselves including myself so
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and the chair
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%

of the
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
concerns that I heard first of all uh I
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
we at the department are not in favor
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
and at DCF not in favor of separating
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
DCF out of DHHS for very good reasons
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of synergy there's a lot
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
of coordination there's a lot of sharing
 
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.270 align:start position:0%
of coordination there's a lot of sharing
of

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
resources um there's a lot of
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
camaraderie a lot of uh leadership um uh
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
work going on um and not only that but
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
around the country around the nation
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty typical scenario where
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the the the dcyf of the state is part of
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
a Department of Human Services and
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically because of the Synergy
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
and and the uh the coordination let me
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
address the uh transparency issue and
 
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.069 align:start position:0%
address the uh transparency issue and
accountability

00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
issue um I appear um every month with
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
the children's oversight committee which
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
which is uh uh Senator Whitley and and
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
many others um and I report every
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
meeting um and they have direct access
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
to me and uh in addition to that um we
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
have the courts that oversee what we do
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
and uh hear all the important cases and
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
make decisions about placement and uh
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
removal of children and reunite
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
unification of children and so we're
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
constantly working in the court system
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's the office of a child advocate
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
who whose main job is to oversee the
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
work of DCF they have direct access to
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
our records uh they go into the same
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
Software System that our case workers
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
have that I have um to access cases and
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
they can pull out things that they have
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about that they red flag that
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
they have problems with or questions
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
about um they sit in uh we meet with
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
them regularly and different aspect
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
aspects of the organization we have a
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
dcyf Advisory Board which also includes
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislators um about half the members
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
are are legislators on the DCF um board
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
which uh representative long uh is a
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
longtime member um so there's a lot of
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
accountability we also have a
 
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.069 align:start position:0%
accountability we also have a
constituent

00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
relations and believe it or not but I
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
get a lot of calls directly to my cell
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
phone from families from Forester
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
parents from Kinship Caregivers and I
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
respond personally to these to these um
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh calls we also send them off to our
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
constition relations which is a really
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
great professional staff that
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
investigates um every call that we get
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
in of concern so if I get a legislator
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
which I get many times who call me and
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
say Jeff we have a problem we're hearing
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
about a problem with a certain case we
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
send out our constituent relations to
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
really investigate to really double
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
check and to really figure out and
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
investigate what's going on here and to
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for REM in the
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
situation there's also Kasa who also
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
work with us um very closely and also
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
challenge us and and um uh you know call
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
out things that they may US disagree
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
with as well as well as agree with and
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
support us so there's a lot of
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
transparency with the with
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
dcyf I also attend I've attended almost
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
every governor and councel and uh called
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
upon to ask questions directly from
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
councils uh counselors
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'll stop there for a moment
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
but if transparency is the issue there's
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of accountability a lot of
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
transparency without removing DCF from
 
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.589 align:start position:0%
transparency without removing DCF from
the

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
department and there's a lot of
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of our
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
department and so uh as far as
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies um it's the opposite
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
being part of Department creates a lot
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
of efficiencies and
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
Synergy as far as who to call we have
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
hotlines we have Central intake and uh I
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
go out I've met with uh forced parents
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
um with Kinship Caregivers um with men's
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
groups uh many of the the the parents
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
and and forcer parents that are within
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
and providing services to our kids at
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
DCF and continue to um reach out um so
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there for for this moment and
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
if there's any
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative long than you
 
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.230 align:start position:0%
questions representative long than you
Mr

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh with respect to sharing of
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
resources could you could you you know
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking Behavioral Health is one um
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
if this department was if they were to
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
be their own
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
Department how would that work would
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
there be a back charge or I I'm not sure
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
how that would uh and I know there's
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
others other than vehicle house yeah
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
great question um I think we share the
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
same question and concern honestly um
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
currently we have our Bureau for
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health under the
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health um and
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
yet because we all share the same home
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
base we're able to seamlessly coordinate
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
um on those cases so in other words when
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
families need services that are Beyond
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
um simply dcf's perview we're able to
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
step in and help connect them with
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
treatment um help them connect them with
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
with Services both um acute as well as
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
um preventive I'll give one example by
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
the way so I think you all know that as
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
part of this uh children system of care
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
portfolio um Hamstead hospital is one of
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
the key um components of our Continuum
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
obviously for those for those youth who
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
are who are most acute um you know we
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
estimate that somewhere between 30 and
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
50% of the um patients we serve in this
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
acute environment have experienced um
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect they may or may not
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
have open cases with
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf um but there's a tremendous amount
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
of overlap and so what we're able to do
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
as a team bringing together multiple
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
divisions director fler director Fox The
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau for children's Behavioral Health
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
is really look at what the needs of
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
these families are holistically and how
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
we ensure we're building a Continuum
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's responsive to their needs so I
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
think that's actually your question
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
lends itself to a concern we have which
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
is would we end up siloing ourselves
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
more um given that we um we are serving
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
many of the same families through a
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
highly integ
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
um Behavioral Health oriented system not
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
simply the traditional um features of
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
sort of Juvenile Justice and um child
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
welfare could I follow follow me uh the
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
the other question is with respect to uh
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
I I have also felt the middle the middle
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
management type has been
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
disconnected um could you can you
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
address that I mean I'm finding that in
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
a lot in the the circuit courts and you
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
know I find in a lot of departments that
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
you know when you get to the middle it's
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's inconsistent a little bit yeah um
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
could you address that sure I mean we
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
are we're committed to continuing to
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
develop our Workforce and I think you
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
know that that includes um not only
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
recruitment coming out of a very
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
difficult um labor market uh during and
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic um but also in terms
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
of how do we build um how do we build up
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
leaders who are able to exercise
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
leadership at that middle level um
 
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
without things having to rise to
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
director fer or my level and I think we
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
see really powerful examples um of
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
success in that regard that don't
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily make the news um but we're
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
continuously engaging in sort of a
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
teaming based coaching oriented culture
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
um in which we use individual cases even
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
last week I can think of one that
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
crossed all the parts that we were just
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking about um Behavioral Health DCF
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital to sort of bring to
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
the for the issues that were that are
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
going on in that in the life of that
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
child and family and identify very
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
critically how are we best coordinating
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
to meet that family's needs and where
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
are we potentially seeing room for
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
improvement so so I think it's um it's
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
happening to an extent uh but it is uh
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly going to be more challenging
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
if if if we're sort of the silos are
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
further apart in my
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
opinion thank
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
you as I look at this uh
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.470 align:start position:0%
you as I look at this uh
flowchart

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
flowchart
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
I can see an issue coming up where
 
00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:31.109 align:start position:0%
I can see an issue coming up where
related

00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
groups someone will say we got to bring
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
in one of these other related groups in
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the conversation oh no they moved across
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
town as opposed to their two cubes down
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
so to me this flowchart makes the case
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
for dcyf being part of this family under
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
your right purview um do you find the
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
fact that these
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
various children's issues and mental
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
health issues are
 
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.910 align:start position:0%
health issues are
together

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
advantageous no it's a good question and
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
I think um as representative hul
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
indicated there are some unique
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
functions um and responsibilities DCF
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
has particularly in terms of its
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with the courts um and its
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
historically uh very powerful
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility around um impacting
 
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
family structure that we take seriously
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
but thanks to the reforms that have
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
occurred over the past five plus years
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
um under under director ribsam um
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
director fleer's predecessor we really
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
are moving in a direction where it's
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's no
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
longer um a surprise or a controversy
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
that uh what families need is um is a
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
level of support and coordination and
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
that includes not just with Behavioral
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
Health but also with our eligibility
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
system um as he said for things like um
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
food stamps for things like Medicaid
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
when they're qualified and so in
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
addition to potentially some of the I'm
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
not actually as worried about us
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
physically being separate to be honest
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
we have a really Dynamic team of of
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
folks who can cross the river and
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
coordinate it's awfully nice being
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
collocated I think my bigger concern is
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
You're Building Systems um that have
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
some really major barriers so we take
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
privacy very seriously in New Hampshire
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
um just talking with our um director
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
over our it systems what we would have
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
to build in order to allow for data
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
sharing agreements and order to allow
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
for passage of information internally
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be a major undertaking of of
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
significant financial cost but also with
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
more separations and so you know it's
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's interesting when I I um most
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
recently worked in the state of Utah
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
where Governor Spencer Cox actually
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
brought um different parts of the Health
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
and Human Services Continuum together
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
with the same arguments of transparency
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
and efficiency so it's kind of makes me
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
chuckle a little bit because I think we
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
share the desire to be high quality
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
transparent committed to continuous
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
Improvement good stewards of public
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
resources I think we do that best when
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
we are um when we're combined under one
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
Department as you know I chair the
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
of circuit court and we had 14 hours of
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
public testimony we had subcommittee
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
meetings and what we found much to our
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
Delight was as we got going in the
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittees talking with Judiciary
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
they having sat in already on everything
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
else or watch the the video of it they
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
had already started to implement some of
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
the things so you know some of us had
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
these wonderful bills we were going to
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
turn in requiring the Judiciary to do
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
this or that but because of hearings and
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
hearings like this they said oh that's
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
pretty good yeah let's let's work
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
continuously on that and I I am watching
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
DCI DCF doing that um I was left out
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
earlier as chairman of DHHS oversight I
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
can bring him in periodically uh as well
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
as all the other groups um that there
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
has been great change and I would you
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
say that there are things that you've
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
heard today that might strike a
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsive cord uh on we can start doing
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
this or we're doing it but we can up it
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
or that's a good idea have either of you
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
heard anything like that out of today's
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah AB absolutely and we really
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to um thank the committee and the
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors for giving us that
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be reminded of just how
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
important it is to be um to fulfill in a
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
very visible way our commitments toward
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
transparency coordination clearly making
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure that um you know when the child
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
advocate picks up the phone and calls us
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
as she does uh or her team does you know
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
each week that we're able to touch base
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
on the Myriad things going on and
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
identify root cause identify the types
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
of Staff training and middle management
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
leadership that um that these cases
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
deserve I mean fundamentally these are
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
families who deserve nothing less than
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
to have their needs met in a way that um
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
that our government has been set up to
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
do and I think when we start to create
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
those separations um I really worry
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
about there being chasms in our ability
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
to uphold that commitment to um
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
communication and transparency that you
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
all um are
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
articulating any further questions
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
you has DCF are um been separated out in
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
the past I can remember at some point
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
things coming together I thought a good
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
question and what was the reasoning then
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
for bringing it under if you know yeah I
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so and and and uh uh
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
director Williams who's our our real Pro
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
um doesn't either I I think what you
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
forward I wasn't aware of your promotion
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
counselor director of legislative
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
affairs so he said director um uh I I
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't believe so it um there was a prior
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
version of this same um policy uh
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
objective brought forward which might be
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
what's ringing a chord um that it was
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
there were there have been prior
 
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
discussions about it but it has not
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
occurred that aware
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
of I'll wait for John
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and thank you for your
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
testimony the final pink card will be
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
from representative Betty gay she asked
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
for three minutes we're running overtime
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
we heard at the chairman and vice
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
chairman meeting today that they are
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
asking because of so many bills we have
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
that if somebody doesn't have anything
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
new to bring they either wave off or
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
limit their testimony to anything new
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
new that you have for us that you
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
haven't heard
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
yet in no three minutes no no I'll just
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
take three
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
sentences oh working Silo to Silo as
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
this is the bill is accused of sounds
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
like you absolutely require physical
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
location collocation to communicate well
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
but I assume that nowadays most work is
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
done via the phone and
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
email this bill doesn't stop DCF
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
Communication in inter agency it adds
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
Clarity and accessibility for the public
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
which I think is becoming really well
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
known the need for that is becoming very
 
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.789 align:start position:0%
known the need for that is becoming very
well

00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
known any
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh this concludes our
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1667 thank you for
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
coming and as much as I would like to
 
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
execute I can't because I don't have a
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
quorum so in a couple of weeks we will
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that gives the advantage that if
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
anyone wishes to speak to the bills
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors to propose an amendment one way
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
or the other based on anything you've
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
heard anything you're thinking about in
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
the next two weeks we will be executing
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in two or three weeks so
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
you've got your chance to do it a chance
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
to polish things up and there we go and
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:02.510 align:start position:0%

my name is representative Deb Hobson and
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
I represent East Kingston and
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
Kingston along with the honorable chair
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh in district 14 of Rockingham County I
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
was contacted by members of the uh by a
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
member of the Department of Education to
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
file this measure that corrects an
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
inaccuracy in the law about how the New
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education is
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
notified of an episode of
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
treatment currently the law states that
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
the courts would notify the doe about an
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment however courts are
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
not involved in an episode of treatment
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
placement uh so I'm simply introducing
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%

loves pink cards my name is Rebecca frad
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
I'm um the administrator for the Bureau
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
of special education at the Department
 
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.470 align:start position:0%
of special education at the Department
of

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
Education um we asked for represent
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
Hobson to introduce this bill for us as
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
it was passed last year through hb2 and
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
there were two um pieces that just
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
needed to be corrected within the bill
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh it as representative Hobson had
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
stated it states that the notification
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
about an EP episode of treatment excuse
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
me um will come from the courts however
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
it does not come from the courts it
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
comes from either DHHS or the school
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
district so we're just adding that in
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
there so it clarifies the language um
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
it's pretty beyond that it's pretty self
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
explanatory we um currently have a fund
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
where we reimburse districts and pay to
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
the schools that students go to for an
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment so all the finances
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
have already been worked out it's
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
already being paid it's just a
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
questions the last time I introduced
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
something as just a housekeeping measure
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
the hearing went on for two hours they
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
totally destroyed my bill and what they
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
came out with was something fantastic so
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to redeem the phrase just a
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill representative
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
bigford thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
you uh for answering my question uh
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
episode uh in this case what does that
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
mean uh episode sure so and um DHHS has
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
uses the language episode of treatment
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
um they could probably explain it a
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
little better than I can but it's
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
typically when a student has a mental
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
health issue that they need to receive
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
treatment for um they may need to go
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
into a placement it could be that they
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
have suicidal ideations it could be that
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
they have other issues that that need to
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
be treated in what isn't considered a
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
special education setting but could be
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
consider is considered a mental health
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
treatment um want to follow up no thank
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
you I think that covers it for me
 
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
you I think that covers it for me
anybody

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
else representative Vice chairman
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
L thank thank you Mr chairman um so just
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
for my
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
clarity this is uh there's there's been
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
a short uh with notifying Department of
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
Education and this addresses
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
that can you repeat I'm sorry can you
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
repeat that there there's been a uh
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
there's been a short in Department of
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
Education being notified of some of this
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
oh no we are notified it's just we're
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying who we're notified by because
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
the currently the legisl the law says
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
that will be notified by the courts but
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
for an episode of treatment it doesn't
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
go through the court system it goes
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
through DHHS and their Bureau of
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health so we are
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
just clarifying that that's how we would
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
be notified because the courts aren't
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
involved in all it's mixed in with our
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
court ordered placement language that's
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
why there was some confusion because we
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
pay out two um funds one is court
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and now we pay out
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
episod of treatment so the language just
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
got a little fuzzy okay very good thank
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.270 align:start position:0%
got a little fuzzy okay very good thank
you

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further thank you so much
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and your pink cards
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
this concludes the hearing on Bill House
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
151 and I've got a few things for the
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee and since I think the
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee is uh most of the committee
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
members are listening in um there's just
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
a few things that I need to uh present
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
to you when I find
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:39.029 align:start position:0%
to you when I find
them

00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is for anybody and everybody
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
um normally we don't have so many people
 
00:59:50.829 --> 00:59:50.839 align:start position:0%
absent and what happened last week is
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
handouts were handed around in a huge
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
pile of paper landed right here and what
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
we will be asking what I've been asked
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
to ask you is um if you see a vacant
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
chair start a pile for that person and
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
then at the end of the day put that
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
person's name on the top sheet paper
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
clip it together so you're making a
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
packet and that can be given to the
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
individual representative when he or she
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
comes to the next committee meeting and
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford has pretty much
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
started doing that with several of the
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah so um anyway that's just
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
been asked because the poor clerk last
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
week um representative ball was in a sea
 
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.069 align:start position:0%
week um representative ball was in a sea
of

01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
paper also traditionally anybody coming
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
to testify here folks um the um clerk
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
gets two copies I believe one for you
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
one for the
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
files and when handouts are started
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
around make sure that if there are not
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
enough some people uh haven't done a
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
head count to see how many people there
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
are in the committee uh I think there's
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
16 that means you need 17 handouts if
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
you want each one of us to get one it is
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the job of the committee
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
assistant or research to run up and
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
downstairs to make copies um graciously
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
they will sometimes but they have other
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
duties as well and any
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
overage after things have been handed
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
out and empty seats get theirs any
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
overage goes back to either
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford or
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative now known as Gibbons um
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
not quite sure where those Stacks wind
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
up going but that's where they go at
 
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
up going but that's where they go at
least

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.549 align:start position:0%
least
initially

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
um we in the chairs are encouraged to
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
line up hearings well in
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
advance because we've got so much to do
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
and we want to make it come out even we
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
have to get the early bills of which
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
there are several out heard and exact by
 
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
February 13th in this committee February
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
15th in the house which means we got to
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
work really uh
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
speedily um the trouble with planning
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
way ahead is sometimes events have a way
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
of interfering if this was more than a
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
heavy Frost out here we wouldn't be
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
meeting well I also discovered we're not
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
meeting next week because it's primary
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
and I thought I was a good little wise
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
chairman by asking everybody is that
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay and only one person said he's got
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
to do something and I promised the vice
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
chair we wouldn't have any fun while he
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
was gone but what I didn't realize is a
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
a it was a house policy not to have it
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
and B the reason is many of the bills
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
are obviously presented by
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
legislators who might need to be
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
involved in the primary day so just a
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
long way of saying we have to be
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
flexible depending on weather and other
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we'll work together to
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
done also on executing bills a bill may
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
be exec the same day is heard now we
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
used to have a little disclaimer note
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the calendar from a
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee saying a bill may be exact the
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
same day it's heard well some of us
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
forgot so now there is a blanket
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
statement right here in last week's
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
calendar page three that says pursuant
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
to house rule 44b executive session on
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
bills may be taken up during the day in
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
which they are
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
heard my rule of and it doesn't say this
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
but the general rule of thumb is with
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
consultation of the vice chair a ranking
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
member we want to make sure this is
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I really don't want to take
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
up and exec a bill we just heard if
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
there is a good bit of division in the
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee at best that means you folks
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
can as I keep exhorting people go off
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the bill sponsors and try to square
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
the circle try to find out what were the
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
objections does that objection warrant
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
killing the bill or can that objection
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
be worked into the bill because it was
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable and that's going to take two
 
01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
or three weeks to do it so I don't want
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
to exec a bill unless it's going to go
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
on consent or nearly so or in the case
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
of bills with fiscal notes it's going to
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
be unanimous or nearly so but on the
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
regular calendar um that's that way when
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
exact days are called in advance if you
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be here you can get a
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
replacement um we if I may speak to that
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
we sure we used to do it this way way
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
back and then that was changed because
 
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of complaints from the
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
public that and even the representatives
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they they felt it was nobody's
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
even taking time to hear them I guess
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
but the thing is going on today which is
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
different is they have uh a place where
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
people can write in sure and they say
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
right on it it doesn't close until noon
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
so they think that they're writing in
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
and people go looking at it and the fact
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
is no we don't even get to see it
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
because we've already voted it out so it
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
kind of rubs the public the wrong way is
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
my my point this is why I won't exec a
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
bill where there's significant division
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
in the committee because you and others
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
may wish to read what they're writing in
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
if we are of one mind that this is
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
either the best billson sliced bread or
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
the one from the you know the what's on
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other end of the river sticks
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
um I doubt there will be controversial
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
comments coming in that would sway us
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
one way or the other so those are the
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
ones I will go ahead and exact but I
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
will limited what other committee chairs
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
do in broadening it is up to them I just
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
want to share the history with you oh I
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that if you don't get it from
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
me check with John I appreciate that um
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
one other thing uh that they have
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
stressed upstairs in our um chair's
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
meeting is no
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
food no coffee in a committee room
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
because there's new rugs and I've not
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
yet gotten an answer to um if somebody
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
spills on the rug should we take their
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
name and send them a bill for cleaning
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping the answer will be absolutely
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
yes we will but no coffee guys gals um
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
no food I bring my lunch that means I
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to the cafeteria or sit on a
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
landing where there isn't a
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
rug um anything else in terms of
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
housekeeping committee wise because we
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
papers now that will be a committee
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
function you papers will come to the
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
closest person who then um it's
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
generally customary not for people who
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
aren't committee members to be up here
 
01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
aren't committee members to be up here
um

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
you made
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
it I did make
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
it I found it pretty tricky it wasn't
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't as bad as I thought
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
but uh you know what I don't like is
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
when it's dark out going home snowing
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
dark is bad enough well I start to get G
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
when I slow down yeah I S I was just
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I slipped making the turn on the
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
stores oh you know and when you come
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
down and you make the turn yeah I
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
started slipping and traffic was coming
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
towards me that was the only minor
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
situation I didn't see off I was
 
01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.590 align:start position:0%
situation I didn't see off I was
surprised

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
actually oh
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
we could end of the day we put these in
 
01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:35.630 align:start position:0%
we could end of the day we put these in
drop

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:52.709 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:10:11.950 align:start position:0%
 
enjo

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:36:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
I open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
1341 relative to the liability of
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents to provide assistance and
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is our very own
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford would you come
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
to the witness table and say what you
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
would like as the prime
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor and let the record show he has
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
already filled out his pink card and the
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:57.149 align:start position:0%
 
clerk

01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair uh my name is
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative David Beckford from new
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
dooro I also represent uh town of
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
Middleton and uh what I've brought
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
before you is uh HB House Bill
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
1341 and um it comes directly from the
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
review that was done that we paid
 
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.629 align:start position:0%
review that was done that we paid
$116,000

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
$116,000
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
for to the University of Colorado I
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
believe and it's very good I hope
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's read it um it's only 198
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
pages and what I have here this is the
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
actual what it looks like the
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
review um and what I did is I copied it
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
onto this P paper that I as a handout
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
for you this front
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
page it's just for reference and then if
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
you come down you'll see um
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and what this is uh a
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation number seven from this
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
review and I'll read it for the record
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty short either repeal the law
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
providing for grandparent liability to
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
support the children of their unwed
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
minor children or add more specification
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
to it there are numerous justifications
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
to eliminate it it is not a common issue
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
child support from the parent if able
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized and establishing policies
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
for consistent treatment would require a
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
lot of time and resources for few
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
cases more specification would entail
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
whether to limit liability only to
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
public assistance
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
cases application to both the maternal
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
and paternal grandparents identification
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
of income to to be used in several other
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
specifications so that comes from page
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh 157 they do have uh more discussion
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
about it throughout the but it's really
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
becomes repetitious so that's why I
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you this and that's
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
you what is the liability of
 
01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:17.229 align:start position:0%
you what is the liability of
grandparents

01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
grandparents
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
now um that they can be drawn into to
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
have to pay check
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
support for their
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
unwed pay child support of their
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
grandchildren assumes that the children
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
well cannot or will not do so no it's
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
more actually I'm not sure of how much
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
that used anymore it it can be actually
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they're addressing that
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
but there is another statute on that um
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
but this is uh they're talking about uh
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
unwed children and so the grandparents
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
now have to pay child
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
support um to someone the other
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents sometime wherever they are
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
could I ask the researcher please to
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
punch up if she hasn't done so already
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 167 colon 3-
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
littlea which is the statute that this
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
bill seeks
 
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.910 align:start position:0%
bill seeks
to

01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
and since the vice chairman has beaten
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
it would you would you read uh Vice
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
chairman the statute that this bill
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate liability of
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
grand liability of grandparents
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
assistance rendered under this chapter
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
or RSA 161 to anyone who is the child
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
born of an unwed minor whose father or
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
mother grandparent of the child born how
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
an unwanted minor has a weekly income or
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
other resources more than sufficient to
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable subst
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
subsistence compatible with decency and
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
health may be recovered from such Grant
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
priate in the same manner and by the
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
same proceedings as provided in RSA 167
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
colon 2 and 167 colon 3 for recovery
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
from other legal liability relatives
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
addresses children of unwed minor
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
children and the grandparents in
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
question have the income to be able to
 
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
do it in other words you're not
 
01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
do it in other words you're not
impoverishing

01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
impoverishing
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
them okay so that's what this seeks to
 
01:41:42.669 --> 01:41:42.679 align:start position:0%
remove yeah and uh why would you seek to
 
01:41:42.679 --> 01:41:43.550 align:start position:0%
remove yeah and uh why would you seek to
remove

01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
remove
 
01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.229 align:start position:0%
remove
it

01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
because because they said to they it
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
could become very elongated they don't
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
think it's uh as you I pointed out it
 
01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
think it's uh as you I pointed out it
says

01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh you should uh be establishing
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
policies for consistent treatment would
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
require a lot of time and resources for
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
few very few cases more specification
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
would entail whether to limit the
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
liability only to public assistance
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
cases application to both the maternal
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
and paternal
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
grandparents and uh identification of
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
income to be used and several other
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
specif ific so there's a lot missing in
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Statue we could either they
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
recommend that we either elongate it and
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
make it very great specification but in
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
the end they're saying don't even bother
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't don't get in don't go there
 
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.790 align:start position:0%
don't don't get in don't go there
they're

01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
four yes representative
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
MC man okay thank
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
you representative a specific to where
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
funds would then come come from is the
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
fall back would the fall back here if if
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
grandparents aren't available would be
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government or the state yeah
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions do we know what other states
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
do regarding
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
this I don't I do I do
 
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.790 align:start position:0%
this I don't I do I do
not

01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
um I think they have pulled away from
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
that quite a lot um the fact of whether
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're wet or not if you're if
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
you of course if a minor gets wet then
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
they become emancipated and it becomes
 
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.629 align:start position:0%
they become emancipated and it becomes
their

01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
do you know if uh this has been brought
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
before I I can't say as I do recall
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay we've done some stuff on I know we
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
did a
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
stepparents and I think that we don't
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
hold them liable anymore okay because
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
they have no rights really uh but I
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
don't think grandparents we did this is
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
the sort of question that I love to ask
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the committee researcher loves to
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
answer do we have anything committee
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
researcher you're going to need to come
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
mic okay and you're going to need to
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
turn the mic
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
on then you're going to need to speak
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
into the mic
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
because it's in 167 it might be and it's
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
title four of the Social Security Act it
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
might be related to federal funds such
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
as tanif so I'm happy to look into that
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
for you because it's not very clear
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
could be a policy in the department uh
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I can look into that for
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
you so in other words if there's
 
01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
something from the federal government
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
lurking in the background what we do
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
with this particular 1673 a may be
 
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
impacted so we need to find out yes and
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
it may change from state to state
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
because not every program is the same so
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
I can look into
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
it well since we cannot exec anything
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
today that would be a nice little
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
project I've never met anybody who more
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
loves to do term
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
papers well yes I wouldn't the people to
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
do the research and put out these
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
reviews um do them quite often like I
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
said they do a
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
contract um with the state and uh they
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know you talking people with
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
Doctorate Degrees and everything they
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
know they know this 4D better than any
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
of us do so that's why I took them at
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
their uh face value you might say when
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
they recommended
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
it well then if um you can provide to
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
researcher um how to find this expensive
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
report maybe a lot of her work is
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
already done yeah uh that is on the
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
child support uh website if it took me a
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
little few minutes to find it but it is
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
there and there's a link there and it
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
opens up the same thing plus I have it
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
in my computer on my cloud I should say
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I think I have an extra C I left a
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
copy here last time I spoke to it and so
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's either me or them and probably the
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
federal government too um but this one
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
just came out December 31st of
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
22 so we're just getting around to get
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
into the some of the recommendation and
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be in this one page
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
you handed out
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
some contact information or something it
 
01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
would be helpful not only to to to
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
approach it from what is what do the
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
feds say but also approach it from what
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
this report says so we can come at the
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
answer to this question does this bill
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
if passed impact um anything else uh we
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
can come at it from a couple of
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
directions yeah uh I should
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
give my researcher
 
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.550 align:start position:0%
give my researcher
researcher

01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh because that direct you right to
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
the page of the summary of
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
recommendations

01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:46.070 align:start position:0%
recommendations
157

01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah these I think I've told you before
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
but these come out every four years
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
is this something uh the
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS legislatively a on to everything I
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
seem to run know something
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
about no I'm sorry I didn't understand
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
the question well I was just trying to
 
01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
pointing see we have two lawyers now on
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
the clock yeah and can you guys bring an
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
answer to the question that if House
 
01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:25.350 align:start position:0%
answer to the question that if House
Bill

01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
1341 about Grandparents assistance being
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
removed I.E RSA 167 freea if that would
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
impact any of the wonderful programs
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
that any of our state agencies receive
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
money for you
 
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.870 align:start position:0%
money for you
may

01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
approach I have to touch it then I have
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
to give it to
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:53.109 align:start position:0%
to give it to
him

01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
the mic on for you chairman parison
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
members of the children and family law
 
01:48:59.070 --> 01:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
Williams I am the director of
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for the Department
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
of Health Human Services and this does
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
take me back in time I think the last
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
time I've been testifying next to rips
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
and Bickford must have been a couple of
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
decades ago but it was but it was B no
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
we well he's he's definitely more
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
handsome and I'm definitely a little bit
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
more grayer so with that um with with
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the department on 1341 relative
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
to liability of grandparents to provide
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
assistance although I don't believe it's
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
reflected in the fiscal analysis of the
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill because when we did report back to
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
the LBA our analysis on it uh they Pro
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
possibly made a determination that it
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
was less than $10,000 and that's why
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't include that onto
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislation itself I represent to this
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee that is part of a recent audit
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
I believe it was through the LBA that
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that they did site was
 
01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
a concern the LBA had a concern over
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
grandparent liability this this legis
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
LBA uh the legislative budget Assistance
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
Office uh at the state level uh and
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
because of that particular audit and I
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
will stand corrected if it was a federal
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
audit but I understood it to be an LBA
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
audit that this actually addresses one
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
of the corrective actions that they
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
would have relative to grandparent
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
liability uh and assessing the
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislation we believe that it would
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
have no impact to department
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
administration and we do think in terms
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
of a policy perspective totally your
 
01:50:22.589 --> 01:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
consideration that it may be very
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
helpful um some of the areas that it
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
would capture and I think reverent
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
Bickford probably already touched upon
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
those uh matters that in cases for
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
example under child's support where you
 
01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
have a I believe he's going to point me
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
to the right section that he's probably
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
already testified to I apologize I
 
01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so I don't want to duplicate
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but uh grandparents who have
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
minor children who have children uh
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
their grandchildren uh are currently
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
under statute still liable for uh
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for certain expenditures
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
such as the the tanif um expenditure so
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
with that if you were to proceed in pass
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
this legislation I can represent to you
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
based upon our fiscal analysis which I
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
was a part of so I do have direct
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that that this has no
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to the department or at
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
least not anticipated and we do believe
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
that it's in line with whether it's a
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
federal audit or the LBA audit
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
corrective action to doing this
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation would be
 
01:51:24.069 --> 01:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
this I do you
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
know this was reviewed by the legal
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
councel uh for the underlying program
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
area and I believe in addition to that
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just pulling up my my notes because
 
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
I do have more extensive notes based
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
upon our fiscal analysis on this
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that this would not impact
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
either uh tanif or the uh Tana Federal
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
block grant that we receive great thank
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative McMahon
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
chairman attorney Williams relative to
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
the funding uh a question as it as it
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
stands right right now with this law Rec
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
um this bill recommending a
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
change if the funding wasn't is not
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
coming from the
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
grandparents then where would that loss
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
of funding be recovered and does that
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
not increase the
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
cost that the matching amount with the
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
reflect I will just defer for a second
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
to see if I can parse out the the
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
question so under the question that
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're posing that we have a grandparent
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
there is assumed liability for the
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
grandparent and the money that we're
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
collecting from that parent then would
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
go back to at least for the U percentage
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
of the uh federal funds or strike that
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
the state funds would go to our general
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
that let me I'll we we raise it if
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's if the bill as it not the bill
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
the law as it current states that the
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
grandparents are
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
the secondary source
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
for for funding or reimbursement for
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
like T of uh spending if this uh this
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill passes and States they no longer
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
have that that responsibility or
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
liability in this case then does that
 
01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:38.990 align:start position:0%
liability in this case then does that
not

01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
increase the uh cost for
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
the children being maintained by this
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
funding and uh with the Chairman's um um
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
permission because I typically do not
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
like to read from but I think it'll give
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
you an accurate answer to your question
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
so um this is an excerpt from our uh
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
financial analysis uh provided to the um
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
LBA this is not anything official from
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
the LBA this is officially from the
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
Department uh tanif is a federal block
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
grant program where the federal
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
government gives States money that must
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
be used for certain purposes and comply
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements one of those
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
requirements is that the state must
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
require tanif recipients to assign
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
support rights to the state and
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the state efforts to
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
collect support and it provides a very
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
long Federal citation however however
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
this I think addresses your question
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
federal law does not require that the
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
grandparents of children of unwed minors
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
support and that answers that thank you
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
sir so the state doesn't require it but
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
chooses

01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct based upon the following
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
two sentences of this what I was reading
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
from okay before you go any other
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
questions I have one from uh the chair
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes um representative
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
sidal who uh sits as you can see right
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
over there would this requirement of
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
grandparents to financially support
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%

01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
child be similar to the grandparent
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to jail for a crime their minor
 
01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.750 align:start position:0%
going to jail for a crime their minor
child

01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%

committed she's asking whoever is ready
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
to answer I I have to say represent
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%

01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%

03:19:24.510 --> 03:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
currently to allow for recording if you
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
fill out a for and ask for permission
 
03:19:28.110 --> 03:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
the day
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
before as part of doing the special
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
Family Court committee we heard
 
03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
complaints from parties regarding the
 
03:19:40.030 --> 03:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
Court's recording themselves because the
 
03:19:42.429 --> 03:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
court records the proceedings and there
 
03:19:45.389 --> 03:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
were allegations that the recordings
 
03:19:47.790 --> 03:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
were being cut off at certain parts and
 
03:19:49.950 --> 03:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
so they weren't able to get the entirety
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
of a recording and so I think it's
 
03:19:56.110 --> 03:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
important when a party is a part of a
 
03:19:57.790 --> 03:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
case and perhaps they haven't thought in
 
03:19:59.750 --> 03:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
Advan that they wanted to be able to
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
record it didn't put in the form but
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
something's happening that they just
 
03:20:05.070 --> 03:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
didn't expect to happen a lot of times
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
these these parties are prosay and they
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
they just want to record it because they
 
03:20:12.030 --> 03:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
want to remember what happened at I
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
think we should offer them that courtesy
 
03:20:18.110 --> 03:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
and so I think in going back I know that
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
similar bills have been put in although
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
they were just to blanketly record
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
anything in courts and they weren't
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
limited to family court and it wasn't
 
03:20:27.070 --> 03:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
limited to only the parties that were
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
part of the proceeding and I did see
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
that part of the push back was you know
 
03:20:36.830 --> 03:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
concern about um recording private
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
conversations between Council
 
03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
essentially and um or interfering with
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
the proceeding and so I did explicitly
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
carve out those things in here just to
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
try and
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
cover any potential issues that have
 
03:20:50.349 --> 03:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
been raised
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
before and that's about all on this bill
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions uh to
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
what degree have you had conversation
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
with um uh judicial officials uh on this
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill so I did speak with the court about
 
03:21:09.389 --> 03:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
it uh I'll let them speak to it but
 
03:21:10.990 --> 03:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
their position was that they did
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
currently have a process for allowing
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
recordings of any type rather you're
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
part of the pro the proceeding or not to
 
03:21:20.830 --> 03:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
fill out this form and as I've said I
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important for parties when
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're a part of the actual case it's
 
03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
much different from somebody in the
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
audience just coming in and deciding to
 
03:21:29.429 --> 03:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
record vers if you're
 
03:21:31.630 --> 03:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
actually you know a party to the case
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be affected by
 
03:21:35.349 --> 03:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
whatever is decided I think it's a much
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
different thing and I think those
 
03:21:39.229 --> 03:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
parties should be able to to record
 
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
without having to fill out the form and
 
03:21:42.189 --> 03:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
whatnot because sometimes parties just
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't know they need
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
to did the uh judicial leaders find this
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
to be a difficult thing on face that
 
03:21:53.790 --> 03:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
they would not want this to take
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
place I'll let them speak to that I
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
think their position was just that they
 
03:22:01.710 --> 03:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
had a process right now to allow for it
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that this conflicts
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
with that process it just says that if
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
you're a party that you wouldn't have to
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
fill out a form in advance essentially
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
to do it but it does still give the
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
judge the leeway of of not allowing a
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
party to do it by saying that again it
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
can't be interfering with a proceeding
 
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
so if somebody's interfering with a
 
03:22:20.670 --> 03:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding as part of that recording
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
then certainly the judge would be able
 
03:22:26.469 --> 03:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
to instruct them not to do so I'm going
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
out on a limb and assuming that none of
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
the other people in the audience are
 
03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
currently a judge in the court system in
 
03:22:40.349 --> 03:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
correct but you get getting there okay
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
do you wish to
 
03:22:49.150 --> 03:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
testify it would be helpful rule one
 
03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:51.710 align:start position:0%
testify it would be helpful rule one
pink

03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
card any other questions of
 
03:22:57.229 --> 03:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
Representative katab on the
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.680 --> 03:23:32.309 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
yes and the chair recognizes rep uh
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
former representative Betty Gabe from
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
Salem for three minutes on the
 
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:48.030 align:start position:0%
Salem for three minutes on the
bill

03:23:48.030 --> 03:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh this is a long
 
03:23:53.710 --> 03:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
awaited Bill I've worked on it myself on
 
03:23:58.630 --> 03:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
the same subject for a few years and uh
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
even though the family court rules allow
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
recording the truth is they also
 
03:24:09.790 --> 03:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
disallow and so U most people have been
 
03:24:12.790 --> 03:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
told um in my experience people that
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
I've met who really want this bill to
 
03:24:18.990 --> 03:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
pass they have been refused the right to
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
record and so they have to order their
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
own recordings which is a modest it's a
 
03:24:28.110 --> 03:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
pretty modest fee to do the recording
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
unlike a transcript of the recording
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is extremely
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
expensive um and they were very
 
03:24:36.550 --> 03:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
disappointed to find out that the
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
recording did not contain the actual
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
events that they were so concerned about
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
that put them at a great
 
03:24:48.429 --> 03:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
disadvantage and uh one of one of the
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
people that I met could actually observe
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
the judge controlling the recorder
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
because he was standing in an open you
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
know an unusual place it wasn't a
 
03:25:04.510 --> 03:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
regular courtroom he you could see see
 
03:25:06.750 --> 03:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
his feet he turned the recorder off and
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
on and when you got the recording uh you
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
could hear funny sounds where uh the
 
03:25:17.309 --> 03:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
recording was uh stopped so it's really
 
03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
really critical to have accurate records
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uh this is the only way that we can
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee that people have an accurate
 
03:25:31.229 --> 03:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted recording of their hearing
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
and I think what I anticipate was as
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
soon as this becomes a law that it's
 
03:25:44.110 --> 03:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay to record your own hearing and you
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
respect the private parts of the
 
03:25:50.950 --> 03:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that then there won't be any few
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
judges who um let's say edit recordings
 
03:25:59.550 --> 03:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
because they'll be found out so it's not
 
03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
that we expect all judges this is not an
 
03:26:06.910 --> 03:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
indictment of all courtrooms but it is
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
pointing out the necessity of stopping
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
some who have a practice ractice of uh
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
not recording anything that they don't
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
want anybody else to hear which
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes is chastising the uh person
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
who's testifying will you take questions
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
sure your pink card said you support the
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill with amendments and I'm wondering
 
03:26:30.269 --> 03:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
what that
 
03:26:30.279 --> 03:26:32.030 align:start position:0%
what that
meant

03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
meant
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
um I made a I made a mistake that I went
 
03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
on another pink card I meant to say with
 
03:26:42.389 --> 03:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment so okay fill that in which one
 
03:26:44.670 --> 03:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
is it oh you haven't given it to me yet
 
03:26:47.349 --> 03:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll take with amendments out
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
because all right any other questions of
 
03:26:56.070 --> 03:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
gay representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um Miss gay specific to the
 
03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
wording on on the bill before us it says
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
it says the judicial branch Family
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Division should this not apply to all
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
divisions or is just the Family Division
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
that you would be in support of well if
 
03:27:22.189 --> 03:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
someone if thank you for your question
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh if someone wanted to amend this to
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
make it applicable to all courtrooms I
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would support that but
 
03:27:33.389 --> 03:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
usually usually when you're making them
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
a change you ask for you get the toe in
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
the door so right now family it's family
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh Court uh uh litigants that I have met
 
03:27:47.189 --> 03:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
with who really really want this but I
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if other people uh
 
03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
in other courtrooms would like it
 
03:27:55.150 --> 03:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
too thank you very much thank you Mr
 
03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
chairman extensive uh testimony to the
 
03:28:00.309 --> 03:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the Circuit Court uh was on indeed on
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
the Family Division so lots of testimony
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
we took in uh that was related to making
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
one's recording the cost of getting it
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you cannot and all of that was
 
03:28:17.830 --> 03:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
related specifically so this bill
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
addresses something that um as I look at
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors many of us are also on
 
03:28:25.950 --> 03:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
that special committee and uh so yeah
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is a incremental thing and thank
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
you so much I see no further questions
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony chair
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
albre welcome back to
 
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
CFL good morning nice to be here uh for
 
03:28:50.349 --> 03:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
the record Dana Au ntional New Hampshire
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
just very briefly I strongly support
 
03:28:57.189 --> 03:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
this uh to be fair we should recognize
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are existing mechanisms in place
 
03:29:02.990 --> 03:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
for recordings either officially
 
03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
escribers or by asking the permission of
 
03:29:09.510 --> 03:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge uh Petition of
 
03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
WMUR with that I've seen very
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
inconsistent application depending on
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
which courtroom you happen to be in
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
across the state so I think this would
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
go a long way towards um providing
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
consistency uh and the other sort of
 
03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
Biggie is the accuracy of the record on
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
appeal uh certainly in my own case uh
 
03:29:39.550 --> 03:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's been an issue uh where recordings
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
and transcripts have sort of not lined
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
up and while that might be unusual it I
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
think it can and does happen so uh
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
anytime litigants have an opportunity to
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
sort of have a backup to what's official
 
03:29:58.910 --> 03:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
I think that would go a long way to
 
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
restoring confidence in the system and
 
03:30:03.870 --> 03:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there thank you very much
 
03:30:07.630 --> 03:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.790 --> 03:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
03:30:12.269 --> 03:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's the observation of the chair that
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary um and our special
 
03:30:21.550 --> 03:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
committee on Family Division of Circuit
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
Court uh a number of us have found the
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to be highly responsive to
 
03:30:31.389 --> 03:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have brought in fact at
 
03:30:34.189 --> 03:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
at one of our subcommittee meetings um
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
they started reporting on what they were
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
already doing that we were about to ask
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
them to do I mean it was that good a
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
relationship so irrespective of the
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
disposition of this bill I find that uh
 
03:30:51.510 --> 03:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we have here will um doubtless make
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
some good suggestions to them with that
 
03:30:58.189 --> 03:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh Erin krian is that attorney eron
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
krian and wow area code 202 the nation's
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
capital and you are uh what do you do in
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
branch good afternoon Mr chairman I'm
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
the general counsel for the judicial
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
branch lawyers needed
 
03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers a lawyer's lawyer if you will I
 
03:31:21.469 --> 03:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
like that and uh what would you wish to
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
say to us here uh I I would first like
 
03:31:27.150 --> 03:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
to thank rep kutab she is always so
 
03:31:29.309 --> 03:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
thoughtful uh in all of the bills she
 
03:31:30.910 --> 03:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
works on and I know that I had
 
03:31:33.269 --> 03:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities to speak with her and that
 
03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
she thinks out many of the contingencies
 
03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
and so I I appreciate that um she put a
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
lot of work into this bill and my
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
purpose coming here is not to take a
 
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
position on it because the Judiciary
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
applies the laws we don't write them you
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
do that uh but I would like to tell you
 
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful to you a little bit
 
03:31:51.910 --> 03:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
about our current process so that you
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
can maybe give us feedback if you have
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
it um on what you might be hearing for
 
03:31:58.030 --> 03:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
example in the special committee is not
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
working um or is working well um as uh
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Albert correctly pointed out uh since
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
inray Petition of wur it has been the
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
the law of the courts that we there is a
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
common law right to record Court
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
proceedings that predates the First
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment it predates our state
 
03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
constitution and so any person who
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
wishes to record a court proceeding can
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
do so using two processes if you're a
 
03:32:24.670 --> 03:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
member of the media you register um and
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
you simply notify the clerk each time
 
03:32:29.070 --> 03:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
you're coming to court to to record um
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you are not a member of the media you
 
03:32:32.670 --> 03:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
typically complete a day pass there are
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
some people who record so frequently
 
03:32:35.870 --> 03:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're just interested in the work of
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
the courts that they register just like
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
the media does but most people are only
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
interested in one or two cas cases
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
involving someone they know um and they
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
complete a date pass that just says this
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
is the my name my number and the the
 
03:32:50.189 --> 03:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
proceeding I want to record uh and they
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
give that to the clerk that and it's
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
approved by the judge before they come
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
in and the benefit from the Court's
 
03:32:57.550 --> 03:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
perspective of having these forms is
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
that there's very often a lot of
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
interest in the same cases particularly
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
high-profile cases and you may have so
 
03:33:04.590 --> 03:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
many people who want to record that
 
03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
there is not space that there have to be
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
pooling considerations that they're
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to displace family members of
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
litigant in the courtroom so there are
 
03:33:13.990 --> 03:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
administrative things that the judge
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
likes to have this information so they
 
03:33:18.990 --> 03:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
can run their courtroom um and one of
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
the things that we do deal with
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately more than we ever did in
 
03:33:25.150 --> 03:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
the past right now is um disruptive
 
03:33:27.189 --> 03:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
persons in the courts we we did not have
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
a traditionally a very large issue with
 
03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
this but more and more we do see that
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are folks that want to make a
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
scene in the courtroom or want to record
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
something for their YouTube page um this
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
is not your typical litigant it's not
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
the folks that you're meeting with who
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
are talking about about their own cases
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a different sort of person
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with and so the the
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
courts do forbid those folks from
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
disruptive conduct and it says
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
explicitly in the guidelines to record
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
into the courts if you've been
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
disruptive in the past you may not be
 
03:33:58.189 --> 03:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
permitted to record the proceeding again
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh but that is that's not common and
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's typically the the same small number
 
03:34:05.429 --> 03:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
of folks uh one thing that the Supreme
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
Court has issued an order is although
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is a right to record proceedings
 
03:34:12.030 --> 03:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
there's not typically right to record in
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
the common spaces of the courthouse so
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
you think of for example someone who's
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
filing a domestic violence petition a
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
juvenile case it's being adjudicated if
 
03:34:22.189 --> 03:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
someone is just recording the lobby
 
03:34:24.389 --> 03:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
areas of the Court um potentially
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
they're impeding on something that folks
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
are not uh expecting to be recorded
 
03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
doing uh and so the court issued an
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
order that a person that was recording
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
outside the courtroom uh could not do so
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not permitted you you have
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
an interest in the court proceedings but
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
not in bothering people who are trying
 
03:34:42.030 --> 03:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
to use the court facilities and and
 
03:34:43.469 --> 03:34:43.479 align:start position:0%
that's typically we where we see the
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
most issues folks that are trying to
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
record people they're trying to file um
 
03:34:49.630 --> 03:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
and that if someone does violate that
 
03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
order we do ask them to leave the
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
courthouse uh so you may have heard from
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
folks that say I I was arrested for
 
03:34:56.189 --> 03:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
recording they're not arrested for
 
03:34:58.110 --> 03:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
recording they're arrested if they
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
refuse to stop recording and stay and
 
03:35:03.630 --> 03:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
wait until the police uh come and arrest
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
them for trespass uh but for the most
 
03:35:07.469 --> 03:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
part I I think that we find that when
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
litigants are interested in recording
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
their case it's not difficult they they
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
they produce this form uh they're able
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
to record they have a right to that the
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
courts have acknowledged but that there
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
are some Court Administration issues to
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
work on like a large number of people
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
that want to record at the same time or
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.030 --> 03:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
person is there anything in this bill as
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
presented that would Clash with those
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
caveats you just mentioned so I I know
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
that Reb kab thought of many of these
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
things she she talked about
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
confidentiality she she discusses
 
03:35:44.830 --> 03:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
disruptive conduct I think one thing
 
03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
that is a general principle of
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
interpreting law is that we have a
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
relatively robust if you decide to read
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
it it's it's relatively long with what
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
row you can sit in and you can't have a
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
mobile equipment and you can't move your
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
equipment during the court proceeding
 
03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
that if if the legislature passes
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
something subsequent is it intended to
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
displace that policy or is it intended
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
to be uh complimentary or reinforcing of
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that existing policy and I think uh one
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
of the 10 of interpretation might be
 
03:36:13.630 --> 03:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
that it's intended to displace the
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
existing policy and I don't know that
 
03:36:17.070 --> 03:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's your intention but I put that
 
03:36:19.550 --> 03:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
question too would counc be informed by
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
the opening two lines amend RSA 490d by
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
inserting after 490d 15 the following
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
new section I don't see the word replace
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
here I see additional language would you
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
agree I agree uh the only thing that I
 
03:36:39.070 --> 03:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
would say is the Court's current policy
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
is not statutory um it it follows on
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
from that court case um and so it's it's
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
promulgated by our own rules uh so
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
essentially when the legislature is
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on area I think there'd be a
 
03:36:52.830 --> 03:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
question of whether it's intended to
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
occupy the entire field that's currently
 
03:36:57.189 --> 03:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
covered by judicial rules would it be
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
helpful to the bill if um an amendment
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
were brought that would add language to
 
03:37:08.429 --> 03:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
say um in effect the
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
following um we are wishing to enter
 
03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
into statute but not at the expense of
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
the Court's right to come up with its
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
own internal policies I think that would
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
certainly be clearer to us what the
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
intention is so that we can implement
 
03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:24.670 align:start position:0%
intention is so that we can implement
the

03:37:24.670 --> 03:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
intention any further questions Council
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh repres Vice chairman long thank
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh so so back to that
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
the uh interfere with proceedings so I
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
would assume that the
 
03:37:41.469 --> 03:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
judge would have authority over that and
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
a judge would say where your camera is
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
to be set up and it is to stay there is
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
that correct yes I I I take what um the
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative has worked on here to try
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
to incorporate all those concerns the
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say is the rule that
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
we have is just very clear you know
 
03:37:59.189 --> 03:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't move your camera during the
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings don't sit too close to the
 
03:38:03.150 --> 03:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
parties and so it it just gives more
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
guidance but I see that in principle she
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
has included that concern okay to follow
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
up on that follow up uh so displacing
 
03:38:13.189 --> 03:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
that current uh what's allowed I don't
 
03:38:15.150 --> 03:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
see this as this place in that because
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the judge could say that
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
stays the same correct what you think uh
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
it or I I hear your intention I think
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's some folks that would take
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an idea in the law of
 
03:38:29.309 --> 03:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
later in time that something that's
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
later if it's intended to occupy the
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
entire field that this is the the full
 
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
guidance that it's intended to displace
 
03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
an earlier um an earlier law so that is
 
03:38:40.990 --> 03:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
just a question for inter that someone
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
would look at this and try to determine
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's your intention but I
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to them to
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
have you know your your statements or
 
03:38:48.670 --> 03:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
any more clarity in the text about what
 
03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
it is your intention to do okay I one
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
more question if I may you may uh so
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
each party uh so I'm a party uh I could
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
could I have my brother or sister doing
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
the recordings or is it I have to be
 
03:39:04.030 --> 03:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
overseeing that that's a that's a good
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
question in terms of the interpretation
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
of the text of the bill I can say what's
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
common now is typically it is a friend
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
or affiliate of the litigant because
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult when you're sitting
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
at Council table to not accidentally
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
record the other party and their
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
consultations so you and the judge
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
typically does ask the recording to
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
occur from the gallery okay so it is
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
usually an affiliate of the party okay
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
so that would be accepted other than
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
myself as a l it's accepted now um I I I
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if someone else reading this
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
would say because it's each party that
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
it has to be that person themselves but
 
03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
I see that that would potentially create
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
an issue that you're having to record
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
while you're at the table and that could
 
03:39:40.830 --> 03:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
be a challenging place place to record
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
from good thank
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
you as a co-sponsor of the bill and as
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman of the special committee I
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
would very much like to see this pass
 
03:39:52.349 --> 03:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
but I would like it to pass in such a
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
way that there is minimal confusion uh
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
we will not be able to exec the bill
 
03:39:59.710 --> 03:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
today because we do not have a quorum
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we will be going into an executive
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
session on the bills of today and the
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
non-exact bills from last week we will
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
be be doing that in two to three weeks
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
because the speaker very much wants
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
these bills uh because we've got 700 of
 
03:40:20.189 --> 03:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
them and we have to move them through
 
03:40:22.830 --> 03:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
therefore um this is up to the bill
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor I realize once the bill is
 
03:40:27.150 --> 03:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
assigned to a committee it becomes the
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee's bill but nevertheless I give
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
great um leeway to the prime sponsor if
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is of the opinion that
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of language would clarify
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
the possible question that might be
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
raised later that will be her call and
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
she could consult with you or indeed
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
anyone and if we can find acceptable
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
language that keeps the purpose of this
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
bill which I think is laudatory but
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
anticipates any issues that may arise
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
then um crank out that language um
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
representative kab and run it down to OS
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
and get it to us ahead of time so when
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
we exec a member of the committee can
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
present that um that's just what I'm
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
saying to just about everybody who's
 
03:41:17.309 --> 03:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
been here last week and this week I like
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
to see things on consent anything less
 
03:41:22.590 --> 03:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
than that I deem a failure so see what
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
we can do okay yes uh representative
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr chairman attorney
 
03:41:33.630 --> 03:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
KGAN specific to the narrative in the
 
03:41:37.070 --> 03:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the comments that you made
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
relative to common law in place uh
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
would would this bill then speak to not
 
03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
recording I don't see that there is
 
03:41:56.030 --> 03:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
language in this bill on the recordings
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know that I can give you
 
03:42:06.189 --> 03:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
an answer is is that your question or
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
have I misunderstood you um Mr chairman
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'll make a little with
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead as clear as I'd hope to be
 
03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
there uh the specificity is is to allow
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
an individual and in this case was going
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the fact that you stated there's the
 
03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
rules are there for Media or non-media
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
based on an application uh that they can
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
do that now but as we heard from a
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony is that we had uh
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
judge judges on the control of the
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
camera on and off and uh so so so that
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
being said what this is stating when I
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
say this when I'm reading here is to
 
03:42:48.149 --> 03:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
allow a party can record based on rules
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
I mean there's the law and then there's
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the application of rules and would this
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
need to be more
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
specific than it is right now so that a
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
judge unilaterally in his or her Court
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
could not selectively determine what is
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
recorded after saying you may record but
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'll control what is recorded or not I'm
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
not aware of an instance where judge has
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
allowed a person to record and then has
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
told them that they couldn't unless they
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
moved into a confidential proceeding in
 
03:43:21.550 --> 03:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
which case just like uh this bill it's
 
03:43:24.510 --> 03:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's not permitted to record typically
 
03:43:26.910 --> 03:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that that would probably
 
03:43:28.750 --> 03:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
be unchanged since the bill also
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
acknowledges there are confidential
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings I don't think the current
 
03:43:35.070 --> 03:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
practice would change in that regard and
 
03:43:37.229 --> 03:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
uh another one follow up okay and and
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
and just for my clarification attorney
 
03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:40.510 align:start position:0%
and just for my clarification attorney
krian

03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
krian
 
03:43:41.950 --> 03:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh who are you representing today when
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
you speak on the courts cuz but that's
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
why I asked the question earlier was
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
this for family court it's only or
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
across Municipal and Superior Etc so who
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
do you speak for certainly I'm the
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the courts and as
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
part of that job um I not only defend us
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
when we're sued or things of that nature
 
03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
I also come to speak with the
 
03:44:02.830 --> 03:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislature when you have questions for
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
us um we do not typically take positions
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
so I I wouldn't want you to to read me
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
as doing that but we do like to be able
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
to answer questions in case it's helpful
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
to you um so i' I've come on behalf of
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch to answer your
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions and and that means that's
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
across all divisions that you speak for
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct although I should say
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I almost always have to confer with
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
someone else to make sure I'm getting
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
you the best most accurate information I
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
would not want anyone to think that I
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
can answer any question of New Hampshire
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
law because I would have to research
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
them before I do but yes I I can appear
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
on any subject and and my last last one
 
03:44:38.429 --> 03:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair as the chair pointed out you
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
have an area code that's not 63 uh does
 
03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
that imply you don't live here I live uh
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
in Northfields I went to college at
 
03:44:46.750 --> 03:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
Georgetown 20 years ago another quality
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
decision okay what I want to make sure
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
that you're local so we can have access
 
03:44:53.149 --> 03:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
to your expertise of course but I I do
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
want to be fair with you I did I I did
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
work with the federal government for
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
some years I went down to DC after 911
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be a federal terrorism prosecutor and
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
I I now can report that I have solved
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
that problem for you you're welcome
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm only kidding uh but I'm
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
now back in New Hampshire where my
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
family lives so that is that is why I
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
have a 202 area code well just for
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
record it's not it's not my problem you
 
03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
know what I'm saying I I want to make
 
03:45:18.269 --> 03:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
sure that where you were is that you're
 
03:45:20.590 --> 03:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
accessible and then your guidance would
 
03:45:22.750 --> 03:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
be recognized immediately of course I'm
 
03:45:24.269 --> 03:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
a I'm a state employee for the judicial
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
branch thank you very much are you
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
familiar of course you are with the
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
Chevron deference and are you familiar
 
03:45:33.389 --> 03:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
that what we're hearing from that
 
03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
because I've been tracing this one for
 
03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
years is that therefore it would be much
 
03:45:41.070 --> 03:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
better when the leg legislature speaks
 
03:45:43.990 --> 03:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to speak
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
distinctly because otherwise the
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy interprets and Chevron is
 
03:45:52.030 --> 03:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
narrowing that so therefore it is
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
incumbent on the bills we file the laws
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
we seek to pass that we say what we mean
 
03:45:59.469 --> 03:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
and we mean what we say so that the
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
there is minimal second guessing would
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
you agree yes there's there's no doubt
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the courts that the
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
clearer it can be the easier it is
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
because we want to implement what you
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
intended we don't want to accidentally
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
do something other than your policy
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
intention thank you very
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
much uh except for rep representative
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
bigford whom I overlooked sorry uh thank
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you um I'm trying
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
to Envision how this works in the
 
03:46:32.670 --> 03:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
courtroom um I I assume people often
 
03:46:34.269 --> 03:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
show up for court before the judge comes
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
out of Chambers so are they going to
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a sign up that says okay you can
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
record this session and then the judge
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
would say okay not anymore we're going
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be confidential like we would at a
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
slackman meeting say but how ahead of
 
03:46:51.389 --> 03:46:51.399 align:start position:0%
time how would they know uh how do you
 
03:46:54.510 --> 03:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
envision that the public would just be
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
told at the beginning of
 
03:46:59.070 --> 03:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings I think it's typically when
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
different cases might be called in the
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
same so one might be confidential case
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
and one might not be yeah oh I'm sorry
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
not speaking into the microphone um but
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
what typically someone does is it's a
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
onepage form called the day pass and you
 
03:47:15.389 --> 03:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
just put your name contact information
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the case that you want to record and
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
you bring it to the clerk's office and
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
they will know how many people are
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
requesting to cord particularly if they
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
have a numbers problem so you can
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
imagine for a very high profile case a
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
lot of different folks might want to
 
03:47:29.189 --> 03:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
record who may not be members of the
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
media which is perfectly acceptable and
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
then there's an issue of making sure
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
that there's space for everyone wants to
 
03:47:35.790 --> 03:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
record particularly if there's big bulky
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
equipment that they want to use and you
 
03:47:39.030 --> 03:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't want them to be disruptive to the
 
03:47:41.149 --> 03:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings so typically folks put it on
 
03:47:43.149 --> 03:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
that day pass and it's all handed to the
 
03:47:45.070 --> 03:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
clerk who then lets them know yep
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
there's room for you no problem um you
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
can come on in um or if there's some
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
sort of issue uh that they can't but
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's that's I would say that's
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
relatively rare um because usually when
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's a case that has that much
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
attention a high-profile case the media
 
03:48:01.070 --> 03:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
pools they they agree to use each
 
03:48:03.309 --> 03:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
other's footage um so it's it's
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
relatively um uncommon to have an issue
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
arranging pool footage with members of
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
the media it's you trailing off for me
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
my hearing is not that good um usually
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
when we have a high-profile case and a
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
lot of media Outlets want to record at
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
once they pull their coverage so that
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
they are using one camera feed um so
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
usually we're able to accommodate that
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
even if we have so many requests for
 
03:48:26.670 --> 03:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
coverage that there's not enough space
 
03:48:29.950 --> 03:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
do you one more do you have um how much
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
in advance do they need to uh day slip
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
you day something day pass it's it's
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
usually the same day it's it's almost
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
always immediately before the proceeding
 
03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.389 --> 03:48:45.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony and
 
03:48:47.149 --> 03:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
with that I conclude the hearing on
 
03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
1266 as I said we cannot execute today
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
for lacking of a quorum and if
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative katab and you wish to
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
meet you have that right and if not you
 
03:49:01.229 --> 03:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
have that right
 
03:49:05.149 --> 03:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
too and with that we now move we I open
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing to House Bill
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
1263 relative to Parenting Co
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
coordinators in high conflict cases and
 
03:49:17.149 --> 03:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
um she needs no introduction but I I'm
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
going to give her one anyway
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
cab thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
members of the child and family law
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record my name
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
is representative kitn cab and I
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Windham Rockingham
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
17 I'm here today to
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill relative to
 
03:49:47.439 --> 03:49:48.750 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill relative to
Parenting

03:49:48.750 --> 03:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
Parenting
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
coordinators I want to note
 
03:49:54.630 --> 03:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
that when the family court was first
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
introduced back in 2004 as part of the
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
family law task force that was chaired
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
by judge Nina
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
Gardner she recommended
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
as one of not many recommendations she
 
03:50:09.790 --> 03:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
had highly recommended implementing
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
a a parenting coordinator and this model
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
is currently used in 15 other states at
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
least um when we got a summary from ncsl
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
they included some of the states that
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's used in although it was not
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive of all including Massachusetts
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
New Jersey and
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont and so it was modeled off of
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
some other some some legislation from
 
03:50:35.910 --> 03:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
some other states I took pieces that
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
kind of made sense from from uh some
 
03:50:42.750 --> 03:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
some pieces and and took some from
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
another so it was my goal to kind
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
of make it as simplistic as possible
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
while covering all the pertinent areas
 
03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
and the the purpose of doing this is
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
really that in these high conflict
 
03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
cases when parties each have an attorney
 
03:51:01.229 --> 03:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
and they're paying quite a bit of money
 
03:51:02.830 --> 03:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
for these attorneys and these cases are
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
going on quite a bit of time the
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
attorneys are kind of each arguing what
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
each party thinks but nobody's really
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
getting these parties together to try
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
and say is there anywhere we can come
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
and find a happy medium on this and as
 
03:51:16.990 --> 03:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
we know when judges decide these things
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
judges don't know anything about our
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
family they don't know what what hours
 
03:51:23.110 --> 03:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
that we work or what our kids
 
03:51:25.389 --> 03:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities are and and
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
how a schedule that they may put put in
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
place may affect this family and rather
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in the best interest of
 
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
the children and so I truly believe that
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
if we could get these parents together
 
03:51:37.229 --> 03:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
with a trained person who is is trained
 
03:51:41.070 --> 03:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
in in either psychology or um social
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
work that can kind of get these parties
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
to make some progress and come to a
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
possible agreement that may best work
 
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
for their family that that would be
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
ideal and and certainly much
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
more financially feasible for many of
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
these families to do so because it would
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
be at a a much you know lower rate so
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
that was really my my goal with this and
 
03:52:03.870 --> 03:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
this would be that both parties would
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
have to agree in order for the parenting
 
03:52:06.560 --> 03:52:08.070 align:start position:0%
have to agree in order for the parenting
coordinator

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
to be ordered by a judge both parties
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
would have to agree to it and in order
 
03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
for any report to go to the judge both
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
parties would also have to agree on that
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that was I talked to
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
several family law attorneys who told me
 
03:52:21.239 --> 03:52:22.149 align:start position:0%
several family law attorneys who told me
that

03:52:22.149 --> 03:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
currently most of the family law
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys will recommend to their
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
clients not to use a g because the gal
 
03:52:31.229 --> 03:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
comes up with a report and it it's going
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
to the judge and the parties can't say
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
oh no we don't want this report we don't
 
03:52:37.309 --> 03:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want to send this
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
report maybe they don't agree to it and
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
they can say that they don't agree with
 
03:52:40.990 --> 03:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
it but they can't there's nothing that
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
can be kind of done to undo that and so
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
with that in mind they typically
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
recommend not to use a
 
03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:48.469 align:start position:0%
recommend not to use a
g

03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
g
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
and with this if they were going to
 
03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
recommend to their clients to use it and
 
03:52:54.670 --> 03:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't need to be have an
 
03:52:56.990 --> 03:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
attorney present in order to be meeting
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
with the parenting coordinator in good
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
faith here they'd want to know that
 
03:53:03.550 --> 03:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
unless the parties had agreed agreed to
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
the the final outcome that this wasn't
 
03:53:06.710 --> 03:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to be used against them and so
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's really where this was kind
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
of modeled from and I am happy to take
 
03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:12.670 align:start position:0%
of modeled from and I am happy to take
any

03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative McMahon thank
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative kutab um
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
just relative to the line four on the
 
03:53:24.149 --> 03:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh where it says the court May
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
appoint and then then it subsequently
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
says upon multiple agreements wouldn't
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh why would you not consider the court
 
03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
shall appoint because it still is
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
mitigated on the agreement of the
 
03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:37.950 align:start position:0%
mitigated on the agreement of the
parties

03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
parties
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:40.710 align:start position:0%
parties
involved

03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:53:43.349 --> 03:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
um perhap so the reason why is
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
that one of the concerns when I was
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
putting this in was uh related to
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and I didn't want to
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
exclude domestic violence survivors from
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
being able to use this tool if they
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to use this tool and so that's
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
why I didn't explicitly put that in here
 
03:54:02.910 --> 03:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
but I did state that they would have to
 
03:54:05.429 --> 03:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
agree to it and I also said May because
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
maybe a judge really just thinks it it's
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of these
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
parties because of something else that's
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
going on and so I didn't want to make it
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
a obligatory thing one
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
followup U uh the followup is relative
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
to the guardian or Guardian NL GL gal
 
03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
not being preferred would would that not
 
03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
give the Avenue that it still will be
 
03:54:36.269 --> 03:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
the preferred methodology for a G versus
 
03:54:36.279 --> 03:54:37.870 align:start position:0%
the preferred methodology for a G versus
a

03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:39.469 align:start position:0%
a
professional

03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:54:42.149 --> 03:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh parenting coordinator to be to be
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
determined the the May versus
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
shell So currently G's aren't ordered
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
unless the parties are agreeing because
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
the parties have to pay for them so I
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
would think that in my discussions with
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
family law attorneys they would much
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
prefer this because it's again if the
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
parties are agreeing on a final outcome
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
of how what they want to do with a
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
parenting plan then it's going to the
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
court versus the g even if the parties
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't agree there's a report that's
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to the court and so with that
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
of holding back perhaps or not fully
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
going all in because you're you're
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking in a reserved manner
 
03:55:23.189 --> 03:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
because you know that these things could
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
potentially be used against you with a G
 
03:55:26.349 --> 03:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
Al verse you know that's not going to
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
happen with a parenting
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
coordinator okay thank you very much
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman anyone
 
03:55:36.269 --> 03:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
else representative Bickford thank you
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
25 at the end of it it says if a party
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
objects to the appointment the court
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
shall appoint a different person or
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
confirm the appointment within seven
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
days after the date of the party's
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
objection so does that Force somebody
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
I so this is requiring that the parent
 
03:56:10.830 --> 03:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
ing coordinator shall disclose to each
 
03:56:14.189 --> 03:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
of the parties if there's
 
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
any potential conflict of
 
03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
interest and if there is one then it's
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
offering the party um seven days
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah yeah I'm hung up on the
 
03:56:46.349 --> 03:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
the court shall appoint a different
 
03:56:48.189 --> 03:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
person or confirm is that what you're
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
looking at too yeah yeah okay I'm happy
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
to look at that language further with
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
you afterwards okay and if I may but
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's if the parties if the court
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
chooses to appoint somebody in the first
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
place yeah go ahead okay we'll get back
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
um uh um there's also collaborative law
 
03:57:14.870 --> 03:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
and there's also mediators and so where
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
do you see this fitting in amongst that
 
03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
those things that I recall and
 
03:57:22.510 --> 03:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
congratulations for going back to 2004
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
20 years ago and looking at the family
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
law task
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
force thank you for that question
 
03:57:33.790 --> 03:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
think it really depends on the mediator
 
03:57:38.429 --> 03:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
that you're getting but a lot of what's
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
been been presented is that
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
mediators the court appointed mediators
 
03:57:46.070 --> 03:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
are are kind of Messengers and they're
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
kind of going back and forth but they're
 
03:57:49.630 --> 03:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
not really suggesting and they're not
 
03:57:49.640 --> 03:57:51.389 align:start position:0%
not really suggesting and they're not
trained

03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
trained
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
to try and help help the parties to
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
reach a happy medium and I think the
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
other thing you're referring to is
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation which is again
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
another tool where you know a judge kind
 
03:58:05.790 --> 03:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
of says well if this were to come before
 
03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
me then potentially I would rule this
 
03:58:10.110 --> 03:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
way and so do you think we could come in
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
the middle but I think this would just
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
be yet another tool that you could use
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
without having
 
03:58:15.520 --> 03:58:18.030 align:start position:0%
without having
to

03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
um get to the point where you could even
 
03:58:23.229 --> 03:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
get neutral case evaluation ordered I
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
guess so I think it's just another tool
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox and it wouldn't be
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
something that would be used unless the
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
parties were wanting to use it okay and
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
one further thing I may thank you Mr
 
03:58:37.950 --> 03:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um The Guardian lium uh has a
 
03:58:41.070 --> 03:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
board that polies them this does I don't
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
see anything in here that would keep
 
03:58:46.030 --> 03:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
them on track from deviating or getting
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
off track like we've seen other
 
03:58:54.670 --> 03:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't know what to say about
 
03:58:58.990 --> 03:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
that I guess I did you have any thought
 
03:59:01.389 --> 03:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
you could share with me so I was trying
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
not to make this too yeah difficult to
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
implement it I am requiring that they
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
hold a current New Hampshire license in
 
03:59:11.189 --> 03:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
their in the parenting coordinator's
 
03:59:12.670 --> 03:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
area of practice so they would have to
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
be a licensed practitioner of some sort
 
03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
meeting these requirements but I was
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
trying not to create kind of another
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
oversight board for yet another thing
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
and another thing that somebody would
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay a fee for to apply to and
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
and all of that so I'm leaving it at the
 
03:59:32.189 --> 03:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court on how to best
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
implement it
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.510 align:start position:0%
um I think
that

03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:40.990 --> 03:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
however they best see fit to implement
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions uh represent
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman uh actually back
 
03:59:53.239 --> 03:59:54.229 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman uh actually back
to

03:59:54.229 --> 03:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:57.630 --> 03:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
four uh starting 20
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
to 28 uh first line
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
I the appointed parenting coordinator
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
shall disclose to each party the
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
attorney the attorneys of
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
record and the courts familial Financial
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh Dennis says on 23 uh that they've had
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
with the child either party the
 
04:00:20.149 --> 04:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys of
 
04:00:23.070 --> 04:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
record that's not a duplicate correct
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's you got to disclose to the
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
attorneys of record of any relation you
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
have uh including with those the
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys of record correct because
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
there has
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
been parties that have mentioned in the
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
past what they proce ceed to be a
 
04:00:40.910 --> 04:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
because the other attorney perhaps had a
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with the G or in the law
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
fir of some sort so I just want it to be
 
04:00:49.630 --> 04:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear if there's any conflict
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
of interest in any way it's got to be
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
disclosed okay and a follow up follow up
 
04:00:57.149 --> 04:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh so what I'm thinking
 
04:00:59.550 --> 04:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
is you know after a lot of these
 
04:01:01.870 --> 04:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and hearing these
 
04:01:04.110 --> 04:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
complaints it seems to me that the
 
04:01:08.710 --> 04:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys of record um um would be
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
problematic because the parents are
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
choosing so if I'm a litigant and
 
04:01:15.870 --> 04:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's a relation in my relation was I
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
happen to be on another
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
case uh you know with with the attorney
 
04:01:24.990 --> 04:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
a record uh but has a parent I'm
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
thinking yeah no I don't want this
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
person uh do do you see I you know I'm
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
trying to um I'm trying to minimize
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
because familiarity isn't you know a a
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know a
 
04:01:42.910 --> 04:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
um social relation it could also be a
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
professional relation which attorneys
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
must have a lot of that uh so I'm I'm
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if do you believe that there
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
would be uh it would be problematic
 
04:02:00.189 --> 04:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
getting these uh uh brto
 
04:02:00.199 --> 04:02:02.030 align:start position:0%
getting these uh uh brto
coordinators

04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
coordinators
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
um because of uh if we could detailed
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
more of the attorneys of record if it's
 
04:02:07.640 --> 04:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
more of the attorneys of record if it's
professional

04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
is that an issue that we need to know um
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a familiarity but it's not a
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
social one it's not a
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh you understand what I'm trying to get
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
at I'm trying to make it easier for the
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
litigants to agree for this
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh and if I find out that
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
this coordinator had a relation with my
 
04:02:37.870 --> 04:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
ex's attorney and it was just um I mean
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't say you have to say
 
04:02:41.070 --> 04:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
what it was well well actually it does I
 
04:02:43.630 --> 04:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
think right I you know if it's if it was
 
04:02:45.149 --> 04:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
just a professional thing it wouldn't
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
bother me it's a professional thing you
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
you run into your profession all the
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
time uh but if it was a social thing
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
different thank you for that question so
 
04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that this does explicitly say
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
familial Financial or social
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
relationship so if the professional
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
relationship was Financial in that you'd
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
been a partner at a law firm together
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
and you were financially benefiting then
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
that would need to be disclose but if it
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
was strictly a professional relationship
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
where you've seen this person before
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
because I mean a lot of these
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
professionals do eventually cross
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
circles and know each other I don't
 
04:03:21.189 --> 04:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
think that simply knowing somebody is a
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
conflict and that might be a little bit
 
04:03:24.269 --> 04:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
cumbersome to have to disclose all of
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
that but I think it's very important to
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
disclose any sort of uh Financial or
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
social relationship or and and most
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
definitely if you're related by family
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay so familiar isn't uh
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh I worked on a group at the
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
bar uh at the bar association with this
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer so familial was was intended to
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
mean that it was a family member um okay
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so I can just double check that
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
definition there um that was used in a
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
few different State statues but I can
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
just check that we have a definition of
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
familial somewhere in ours okay thank
 
04:04:06.189 --> 04:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have another bill and
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
another one following that and the
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
weather is still not very nice and I
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
have a stack of cards uh the chair is
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
given discretion to limit the amount of
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
time a person can speak we were also
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
exhorted at chairman and vice Chairman's
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning to say if you are
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
called upon a little further down the
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
stack of cards and what you have to
 
04:04:39.710 --> 04:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
present to us us is pretty much what we
 
04:04:39.720 --> 04:04:40.750 align:start position:0%
present to us us is pretty much what we
just

04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
heard the chairman has the right to say
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you say it in one
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
sentence and that is for the good order
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
of all the hearings we have so with that
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
in mind I'm going to give um the
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
remaining uh speakers uh three and a
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
half minutes and I've got to watch and
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
at 3 minutes I'll hold up my hand or
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
wave which means you wrap it up in a
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
half a minute
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
and one person has been very very um
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
exceptional on this is Mr tangu you have
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
been the time management Rockstar so
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
I've got a pink card from you and if you
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
would like to come up three minutes once
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
mic thank you chairman Parson um I
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh just start out um uh with
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
discussing uh the previous bill that I
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
was listening to um I am in support of
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
the that will take out of the minutes
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
here if you wish go ahead um for the
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
recording in the court I do agree with
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
that um however there's an amendment
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
that I will suggest and I know that
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're um not able to exec these right
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
now um but the restrictive language
 
04:06:04.630 --> 04:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
article 8 says that the government shall
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
be held accountable and that allows in
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh for us to record in the
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
courts um and so
 
04:06:16.590 --> 04:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
therefore I ask that you guys remove
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
bill um anything that restricts anyone
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
from recording uh you can record the
 
04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
court can restrict what you um publish
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
so even if something's private um now to
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
this bill I am in support of this bill
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a great Bill there was a
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
lot of care that was put into it
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
um for one thing that uh the parties get
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
to decide at the front end to use the
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
court services and then on the back end
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
before anything's submitted they're able
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
to decide whether or not to do that um
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
there is one thing that I am concerned
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
with though however um and that is the
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
requirements to become
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
a uh appointee uh to help out I think
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
that that is restrictive I think that we
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
do need some more people who might be
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
interested in family law and families um
 
04:07:21.429 --> 04:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
that AR in the Echo chamber of the uh
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
legal uh construct um and and those
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
requirements to have I I agree with the
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
requirements to have training however
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements to have a specific
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
education I have a GED I'm articulate
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm well read I can understand these
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
laws and um I think that will alleviate
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
and bring some other people in providing
 
04:07:44.910 --> 04:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
that they do go through the training and
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
um with that being said uh I'm I'm all
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
set if there's any questions I'd be
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%

much chair now calls upon uh The
 
04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.119 align:start position:0%

minutes thank you Mr
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I have I have a few
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions um my first my first statement
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
is I really like the this bill it has
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful parental Choice built into it
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
sections 1 2 3
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh six really spell it out I have a
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns and I may have a may
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
have a solution for the confusion on
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
lines 26 and 27 about if it's talking
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
about the appointed par parenting
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
coordinator who might have a conflict of
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
interest a conflict of interest so
 
04:09:04.030 --> 04:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
online's 20 um four a party shall have
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
seven days from the date of the
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
disclosures to object to the appointment
 
04:09:09.870 --> 04:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
ointment based upon information if a
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
party objects to the appointment the
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
court shall appoint a different person I
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
would put a period there and then if no
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
objection is filed then the judge would
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
confirm the appointment within seven
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
days if that's the intent of the
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
authors um my
 
04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
concerns so that's a that's not really a
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
serious concern on mine except if you
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
really mean that if somebody objects 7
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
Days Later the judge could simply say
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's tough you're getting them so I
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
would like you know that is one of my
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
concerns that I'd like to get fixed um I
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
have a question about using a parental a
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator which sounds
 
04:10:01.109 --> 04:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
really good does this mean somebody
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
could be forced to have a
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
gal I've talked with people who thought
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
they had no choice and they had to have
 
04:10:12.189 --> 04:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
a g and once they had one they couldn't
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
get rid of it and then I've heard other
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
people talk about a g being uh an
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
option so I would really prefer to make
 
04:10:25.870 --> 04:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
sure the wording allowed that people did
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
not have to have a gal they could choose
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
a parenting
 
04:10:30.319 --> 04:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
a parenting
coordinator

04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
see one of my real serious concerns is
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
in seven Roman numeral 7 page number 11
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
two a parenting coordinator appointed by
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
the court shall be immune from civil
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
liability in any claim for injury family
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
court and that's where I'm coming from
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
is family court has lots of people who
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
are immune and no matter what awful
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
thing happens the the litigant is pretty
 
04:11:05.319 --> 04:11:06.109 align:start position:0%
thing happens the the litigant is pretty
much

04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
stuck um
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
if they get a decree that cites things
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
that are not that are factually
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
inaccurate they cannot even appeal based
 
04:11:20.830 --> 04:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
on factual inaccuracy so I'm very
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
concerned how somebody else like a g
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
too somebody else being
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.309 --> 04:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
liability I
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
think oh ran roll five how many seconds
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
do I have you have half a minute okay
 
04:11:44.670 --> 04:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned about the fees and
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
costs in Roman five they shall be paid
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
by the parties equally and if we really
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
do divorces and split down uh monetary
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
values in the middle then they'd be
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
equal unless the court enters an order
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
directing otherwise again if the person
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator can recommend one
 
04:12:08.830 --> 04:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
person pay more based on their party's
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
failure failure to work in good faith it
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
could just be that the parenting
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator has had it with them and
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting even so that that's my
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
concern that I don't think I really like
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 either thank you so much
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%

04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
all thank chairman Parson I am a a
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
victim of um high
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
conflict divorce situation that requires
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of interaction with
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
a court we can divorce for 10 years and
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
she has been held in contempt six times
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
that has been arrested for I am
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing B there are I I while I
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this bill the
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue at hand is the effectiveness of
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator because I we
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
have worked with parenting coordinators
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
in my experience that have a I'll use a
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
psych psych psychology background and
 
04:13:35.229 --> 04:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
they are they do not want to put in hard
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
decisions hard requirements
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
for the parents to
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
enact typically and we have found is
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
that a parenting coordinator with a
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
legal background will come in and make a
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
decision enforcing an action that is
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
required so while I support the bill the
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
the lack of Effectiveness the lack of
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
ability to make changes the lack of
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
ability to hold yes sir the mic front I
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
have it on it's
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
not now it is on apologies do I need to
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
restate I car myself well all picked up
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
from thank you so my concern is that the
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator does not have
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
the authority if not granted
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
specifically by the judge in order to
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
make change in effect in effect we'll
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
call it a penalty if one parent overacts
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
one parent does not comply with an order
 
04:14:32.189 --> 04:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
one parent does not do what's in the
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children if you're
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
just there and they try to affect a
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
mediate mediated solution and one parent
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
is not open to doing that then it
 
04:14:44.670 --> 04:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
creates a situation where the parenting
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator has their hands tied and
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
can't do anything so a parents could be
 
04:14:51.870 --> 04:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
spending money and one parent just
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree therefore doesn't affect
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
any no changes made and it's a waste of
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
money that's been my experience I worked
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
with Dr Garber down in down in nashwa
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
and he wasn't able to affect
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
change any questions for the witness
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for yes go ahead repres uh
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Vice thank you Mr chairman so
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
so in your experience with 10 years you
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
have had a coordinator parenting have
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
you had a parenting coordinator had
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
three coordinators okay right Dr Garber
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
being one of them uh another lawyer
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
being another one and then another
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer being another one the issue
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
became you know the my ex-wife's ability
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
to pay therefore I was funding all of it
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
and there was no
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
let's say ability to enforce a decision
 
04:15:45.309 --> 04:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up with me uh I mean I I
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
respect your opinion with this next
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
question is um do you do you do you
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
sense that you and your ex would have
 
04:15:59.149 --> 04:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
agreed with a parenting
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator initially we agreed with
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
bringing on Dr Garber and then Dr Garber
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
in the psych in psychological profile
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
side the psychologist side at Dr Garber
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know we both agreed you know in
 
04:16:15.630 --> 04:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
front of him to certain solutions for
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
our children and then she just stopped
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
following them right and that was and
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
then Dr Garber was like okay you did
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
this you there's no penalty to my
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
ex-wife for not following what was
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
agreed upon yeah but with respect to
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
this bill uh both parties have to agree
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
do do you see a complication with that I
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
do I do because if both parties can
 
04:16:40.269 --> 04:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
agree and it can be a great relationship
 
04:16:42.910 --> 04:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
and great thing but if the one of the
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
parties violates the agreement that is
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
you know that you talk about in in
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
working with a coordinator there's no
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce unless you go back to
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
the court file a motion and do that
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
right uh follow up I may follow
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
articulate this better yeah what I'm
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
meaning is that both parties have to
 
04:17:03.550 --> 04:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
agree to the parenting coordinator yes
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
do do you see complications with that
 
04:17:07.870 --> 04:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
like in your case would you I you think
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
you could agree I know you agreed with
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
one you had three I think you said
 
04:17:11.119 --> 04:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
one you had three I think you said
that's

04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:17:16.030 --> 04:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
correct I we agreed to a coordinator
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
right that was fine okay that that was
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
established okay in the me in in the
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
sessions with the coordinator with Dr
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
Garber there was agreement on how to
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
approach certain challenges with
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
different different kids and then she
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
just violated that agreement that's what
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to but as far as agreeing
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
to the coordinators that's that's okay
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you you representative
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
bigford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
um if you're already using a parent
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh why do we need a bill for
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator is there something
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
bill my my view on the parenting
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
coordinator holistically generally is
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
correct that there is a need for it
 
04:18:03.269 --> 04:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
right such that people have are made a
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
made aware of it not everybody is made
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
aware of it we were made aware of it
 
04:18:09.510 --> 04:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings that that's
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary there is a
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
codification of of the need for a
 
04:18:16.990 --> 04:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
parenting Bill parenting coordinator is
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
that and the judge can bring it up and
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
the judge can can do that I fully
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
support that and my point here
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford is that there
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be the ability for the the
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator to affect
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
change am I answering your question I
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't look like I am not the way I
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
expected okay can you restate your
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
question please um well if we already
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
have if I may paring coordinators out
 
04:18:46.030 --> 04:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
there because I thought I heard that
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
this is something new um then why do we
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
need a piece of legislation that doesn't
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
really do any policing or any uh
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement or any anything the judge
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
can already do it apparently according
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
to what I think I hearing from you there
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
are parenting coordinators in this state
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
that are effective and there are
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinators in this state
 
04:19:06.990 --> 04:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
that are ineffective and there are
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinators that don't have
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
any training they call themselves
 
04:19:09.920 --> 04:19:10.790 align:start position:0%
any training they call themselves
parenting

04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
coordinators but if I made the judges a
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
signing parting coordinators in in my
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
situation the first one with Dr Garber
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
was mutually agreed upon did the judge
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
get involved at all and say yes I agree
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
you can have that yes and we took an or
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
the the parenting coordin required us to
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
have an order from the court assigning
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
him as a parenting coordinator
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's good thank you
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir chair would like to call back
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative katab to answer that
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
question because you filed the bill I
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm a co-sponsor but if we have
 
04:19:50.830 --> 04:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
parental co parenting coordinators in
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question so in my
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
discussions with the court it was
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
an idea from them to explore this they
 
04:20:13.389 --> 04:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be helpful at one
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
point um and I don't think that perhaps
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
all the judges are even aware that maybe
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
that there are some that are privately
 
04:20:22.830 --> 04:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
however I'm not sure that something
 
04:20:28.510 --> 04:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
exists right now for the judges to
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
actually order one to be used I could
 
04:20:30.399 --> 04:20:31.910 align:start position:0%
actually order one to be used I could
see

04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
if the parties are if they're told like
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
hey you can do this if you want to do
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
this but I don't think there's anything
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's permissive for the judges to
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
currently order them but I'll let the
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
this gentl has had three of
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
them well he was told that he could have
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
them but he didn't state that he was
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
ordered to do so by the court or
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
anything the court just one of the
 
04:20:57.870 --> 04:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
judges made him aware that he could do
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
it the bill before us does not order it
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
either well it's permissive that they
 
04:21:06.030 --> 04:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
are able to order it right but it's not
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not sure that they're
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
currently able to do so okay uh to your
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge um are there presently
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
academic or professional qualifications
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
in place that this bill now adds not to
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
my knowledge uh to your knowledge um in
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the uh coordinators presently serving is
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
there 24 hours of training in fields or
 
04:21:32.830 --> 04:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
does this bill add it to your knowledge
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
this bill adds that and to my knowledge
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be something exempting
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
a report going to the court unless both
 
04:21:42.510 --> 04:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
parties agree without this bill and I
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
think that's a big pause that I heard
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
from several Family Court attorneys that
 
04:21:47.950 --> 04:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
I spoke with that they wouldn't advise
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
their clients to use one
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
unless that unless both parties had
 
04:21:54.109 --> 04:21:54.119 align:start position:0%
agreed that the report would be going
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
into the into the court because they
 
04:21:55.720 --> 04:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
into the into the court because they
wouldn't

04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
04:21:58.830 --> 04:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
want something to go forward that one
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
party likes and the other party doesn't
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
like is there anything else in this bill
 
04:22:05.149 --> 04:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
that I haven't thought of that this bill
 
04:22:09.870 --> 04:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
exists well also there's the requirement
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
for the disclosure if there is a
 
04:22:16.750 --> 04:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest which I know that
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's been something that's come up
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
many times in in regards to the gal
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
thing I know that there was an issue
 
04:22:24.510 --> 04:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
that the judicial conduct commission had
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
gotten involved with with the judge who
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh that had a so very much so a social
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
relationship with her family uh so this
 
04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
would also protect for that so I think
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
that there's several things in here
 
04:22:43.950 --> 04:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
that would be provided that are not
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
currently provided for good I think that
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
answers representative Bickford's
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the clarification
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh while you're here while
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
you're here W sherff yeah uh Vice
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
chairman long uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
so representative uh I I just need to
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
clarify my understanding was in the uh
 
04:23:07.229 --> 04:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
in the Family Court committee
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
there were high conflict um there were
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
apparently coordinators were high
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
conflict my understanding that it wasn't
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
on all the high conflicts it was the the
 
04:23:20.590 --> 04:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine 10 years uh and
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
there were a shortage of them they
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
weren't appointing them
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
to um you know an immediate conflict uh
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
case is that your understanding that
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what I got out of the
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
need for
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
this so I think what you're referring to
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
is the high conflict docket which not
 
04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's referred there but that's
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
not that doesn't have a parenting
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator that was just specific
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
judges that had been assigned to this
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
high conflict docket that could take
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
more time with these cases to
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
to get more in depth with them so so on
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%
that list would this uh would parenting
 
04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
option so that that's something separate
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's just a high conflict docket where
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're assigned to a specific Judge
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
who take who takes these high conflict
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
cases and and is more indepth with them
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
and has more time set aside for those
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
cases okay yeah my this is a completely
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
different tool it would be separate okay
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
so so um so parenting coordinators
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't be assigned
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
to that list I mean even though it's a
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
fresh conflict uh you know it's it's
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's a fresh case uh I I mean I just
 
04:24:38.670 --> 04:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
just recall in the conversations with uh
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
this family uh Court committee uh we
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
thought this was a good idea but it
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't being used enough and I don't
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
know why it wasn't being used I thought
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't allowed or and that's
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
why this bill was necessary to uh you
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
know I thought it was a good idea to
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
have these coordinators that would be
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
helpful uh and that's where I'm thinking
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill would help that yeah I
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think it would help and
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps attorney krian might
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
have some more of the Court history than
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
I have um with regard to the usage of
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
them but they could absolutely be used
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
in addition to being on the high
 
04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
conflict docket okay thank you thank you
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you and the last to testify is Mr
 
04:25:26.479 --> 04:25:30.670 align:start position:0%
thank you and the last to testify is Mr
Dana

04:25:30.670 --> 04:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair again Dana
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
alre uh Nash New Hampshire I strongly
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh just to Echo uh
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
some of the things we heard earlier uh
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
first and foremost it is definitely
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
another tool in the Box I think it's a
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
very valuable
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
tool uh second uh I'd urge you to
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
consider this uh as a very useful tool
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
in combination with the bill that's
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
10006 uh is sort of addressing two two
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
different ways to address a very serious
 
04:26:21.389 --> 04:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
problem which is how do you get parents
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
to follow a parenting plan if they're
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
struggling to do that and I Echo very
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
strongly what Mr Penis said earlier I'm
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
facing have faced those issues myself uh
 
04:26:38.910 --> 04:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of of whether we need this uh I
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
would respectfully argue the primary
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem is that we haven't had it for
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
the past seven years and that I haven't
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
been able to take advantage of this at
 
04:26:48.960 --> 04:26:51.469 align:start position:0%
been able to take advantage of this at
statute

04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
um the the issue is as you put it say
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
what you mean mean what you
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
say this puts everything in on what the
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
qualifications are uh what the rights
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities of the part are it
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
sort of gets the wild west out of it
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
where you know Mr penk went through
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
three and I didn't have an opportunity
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
for any and I sure would have liked
 
04:27:17.439 --> 04:27:19.670 align:start position:0%
for any and I sure would have liked
that

04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
um just uh one other technical point to
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on what the honorable Betty
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
gay said on immunity so this is page
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
two uh lines 11 and 12 I would would
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest the word shall be
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
immune from civil
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
liability be amended shall be afforded
 
04:27:44.359 --> 04:27:46.910 align:start position:0%
liability be amended shall be afforded
qualified

04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
04:27:49.469 --> 04:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
immunity could you speak to
 
04:27:54.910 --> 04:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
that uh yes so the sort of two extremes
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
04:28:01.149 --> 04:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
avoid uh are on the one hand where
 
04:28:04.030 --> 04:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
somebody in this position has gone
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
really off the rails
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
and nobody has any recourse and I think
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's kind of already in here is
 
04:28:16.269 --> 04:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
willful and won and I've had my
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
experiences where I felt that I've not
 
04:28:19.560 --> 04:28:20.269 align:start position:0%
experiences where I felt that I've not
had

04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
recourse for because of immunity issues
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
the flip side of that coin is you don't
 
04:28:29.229 --> 04:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
want a wild west where anybody can get
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
sued for just about anything because
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
then nobody wants to take the
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
job and we need
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
lots of people who want to take this job
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
we could use a lot of these people doing
 
04:28:45.710 --> 04:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
a good job and so I think qualified
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
immunity strikes a happy medium and it
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
also again nails down to say what you
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
mean and mean what you say for the rest
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the language in the bill will you
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
take questions yes any questions from Mr
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
albre seeing none thank you so much and
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
this closes the hearing
 
04:29:11.950 --> 04:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
on what thank you oh you're welcome
 
04:29:11.960 --> 04:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
on what thank you oh you're welcome
house

04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:29:18.109 --> 04:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
12163 and let's take about 30 seconds to
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
clips and once again we cannot exec the
 
04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
bill today because we lack a quorum we
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
will do it in two or three weeks um and
 
04:29:35.109 --> 04:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh there is no mandate for any amendment
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
to this bill bill but it's possible and
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
if so make sure it gets done in advance
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
so we can see it just before our exec
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
session and it will be then presented by
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.109 --> 04:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
committee and now I open the hearing on
 
04:29:55.870 --> 04:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
106 relative to creating a family access
 
04:30:04.189 --> 04:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
motion for the enforcement of parenting
 
04:30:08.349 --> 04:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
plans Prime sponsor representative katab
 
04:30:18.429 --> 04:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.109 --> 04:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
members of the child and family law
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
committee I'm representative Caitlyn cab
 
04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
17 the reason for this family access
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
motion Bell is that we currently have on
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
the books
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
461a 4 which is a contempt motion and
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
the way that that statute is written
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
it requires that a Content motion be
 
04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed and I put an emphasis on the
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
word reviewed by the court within 30
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
days and so what that means is just that
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
they need to to take a look at it it
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they need to take any
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
action it does not mean that they need
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
to call a
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
there have been some cases where it
 
04:31:14.189 --> 04:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
took multiple years before a hearing was
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
actually held on these and so I think at
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the day when we have some of
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
these high conflict
 
04:31:22.030 --> 04:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
cases and there's finally some sort of
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
an agreement reached we have or there's
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
been one that's court ordered we have a
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
parenting plan in place and then one
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
parent is not following the parenting
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
plan there's not a whole lot that the
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
parents can do because
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
the police will tell you well you have
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
to go back to court and then if you file
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
the contemp motion the court doesn't
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
always hear it very very timely and so
 
04:31:47.710 --> 04:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
this was modeled off a legislation out
 
04:31:47.720 --> 04:31:49.030 align:start position:0%
this was modeled off a legislation out
of

04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:31:49.040 --> 04:31:50.990 align:start position:0%
of
Missouri

04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
Missouri
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
and when they implemented this they
 
04:31:53.760 --> 04:31:56.189 align:start position:0%
and when they implemented this they
actually

04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
had a decrease in some of the conflicts
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
because it was enough to kind of scare
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
the other party that wow there can
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
actually be these consequences if I'm
 
04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
not following the parenting plan and and
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that there is an
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
emphasis in section 4 that it's really
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
the visitation piece that we're giving
 
04:32:17.790 --> 04:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
these these punishments out for so this
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
isn't you know the the parent is
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
um not sending Suzie in in the clothes
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
that that the other parent wanted them
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
to come home in or whatnot this is you
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
know you're not following the visitation
 
04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
that you should be and you're
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
withholding that the child from the
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
other parent and I think there's been an
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
increase in in many states with these
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
with with with this being an issue and
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
we want to be on top of this and address
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
this and and ensure that parents aren't
 
04:32:49.229 --> 04:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
missing out on that important time as
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
their kids are growing up so that's what
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.680 --> 04:32:56.469 align:start position:0%
 
do

04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:32:56.479 --> 04:32:58.670 align:start position:0%
do
questions

04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
anyone representative Bickford thank you
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you again um
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay um on line
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
five and I see it again on line 16 and
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
18 and they used the uh term uh
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
visitation which New Hampshire we don't
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
use that anymore we use parenting time
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
and uh parting
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
time um so I I think it would be
 
04:33:30.750 --> 04:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
important to to change that to New
 
04:33:33.150 --> 04:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire language and you'll find that
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
in the family law task force but
 
04:33:38.429 --> 04:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation I appreciate that and I
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
am happy to amend to State parenting
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
time in there instead of uh visitation
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
super while you're up do you see any
 
04:33:51.629 --> 04:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
other places where the language should
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
be brought better into
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
conform uh is there more it's lines 15
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
and 16 and I will take care of that okay
 
04:34:04.109 --> 04:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I caught Mike 18
 
04:34:06.029 --> 04:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
as well okay
 
04:34:07.709 --> 04:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
04:34:12.029 --> 04:34:12.039 align:start position:0%
L I did well you get back to me do you
 
04:34:14.429 --> 04:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
want me to go ahead or anybody still has
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
a question well we still we on the
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
specific thing of language changes while
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
we remember it then we'll come back to
 
04:34:21.240 --> 04:34:23.109 align:start position:0%
we remember it then we'll come back to
you

04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:25.709 --> 04:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
okay you thought you line
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
28 line line 28 is uh enforced
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
visitation rights thank you and I'll
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
remove the custody part as well just to
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
say parenting time instead of
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
custody or visitation good job eagle
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
eyes uh representative Bickford you may
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
proceed uh with your question chairman
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you again um there's another
 
04:34:49.709 --> 04:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
statute I I think I'm G to guess it at
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
633 co4 I think um but it's about
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
interference with custody or
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
interference with parenting uh time and
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have spoke to it and
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
said hey how come the police don't go
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and get them that's a crime and it
 
04:35:06.109 --> 04:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
actually is a crime in that uh statute I
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're familiar with it or
 
04:35:10.269 --> 04:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
not you are okay well some of the
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
problems I've
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
seen is people will complain and say you
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
know she or he has not you know get the
 
04:35:20.590 --> 04:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
children to me when they should and uh
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
that should be a crime and so I go like
 
04:35:25.070 --> 04:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
well how late are they well 15 minutes
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
later that's my time and I go like
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's kind of petty and uh so I I've
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
always wondered well what would be
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the col off point and say
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
yeah it's interference it would be
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
criminal and what should go down this
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
line or down this Lane here might call
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
it any thoughts on that thank you for
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
the question so I think with the
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
interference statue I think it also
 
04:35:52.590 --> 04:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
involves like removing the child out of
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
the state for the purpose of withholding
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
them from the other parent essentially
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
during their parenting time is what I
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
think stronger penalty there yeah I
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
think that kind of is what it talks to
 
04:36:04.510 --> 04:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
but you know I didn't when I when I read
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
through when this was implemented in
 
04:36:08.830 --> 04:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
Missouri and and this was many years ago
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was implemented in Missouri I I
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
think it was almost 20 years ago um I
 
04:36:16.269 --> 04:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
have the number in my notes but um one
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the things that they had mentioned in
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
there was that they didn't want to
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
mention a specific number of minutes or
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
something that a party was late because
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
what they didn't want was to create
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
another problem where somebody said oh
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
well this statute only applies if I'm
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
more than a half an hour late so I'm
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to be 29 minutes late dropping off
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
the kids every time cuz that's certainly
 
04:36:35.551 --> 04:36:35.561 align:start position:0%
not you're not acting in good faith and
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
I think in that point if somebody is
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
habitually always dropping their kids
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
off 20 29 minutes late that would be
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
more reasonable right this is giving the
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
judges the discretion here and to decide
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
what is or isn't reasonable and I'm not
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we should Define that I would
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
hope that a party is not going to file
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
something like that and if if if they do
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
then they're paying a filing fee you
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
know to to go ahead and file that so I
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
would hope that it would be for good
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
cause okay thank you
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative long thank you
 
04:37:15.869 --> 04:37:15.879 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh yeah just more clarity on
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh parenting time uh what you're saying
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
is the actual parenting time uh so um
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
like in the parenting plan I pick up the
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
child when I'm getting the visits they
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
pick up the child when it's time for
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
them uh that that's not what you're
 
04:37:34.639 --> 04:37:36.349 align:start position:0%
them uh that that's not what you're
looking

04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
for no so this was more to be just
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
towards the the visitation time because
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
I think that's really what I I think
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
that there
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
is there is a contemp motion that is
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
available if there's other areas that
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
are being broken and perhaps less of a
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
hey we need to hurry up and have this
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
because you
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
know I uh actually saw a video on on Tik
 
04:38:01.310 --> 04:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
Tok two nights ago where a judge had
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
ordered that basically a a a parent had
 
04:38:08.109 --> 04:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
violated a DV order and so because of
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
that the mom withheld the child from the
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
father and by the time the order was
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually heard it wasn't until January
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so at that point between September
 
04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:19.959 align:start position:0%
and January much parenting time had been
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
dismissed and the the the judge said
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
well I understand but I didn't change
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
your your parenting order as part of
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
that DV violation so you still violated
 
04:38:29.470 --> 04:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
that so now you need to give him the kid
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
for 67 days straight and so I think
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
to make make sure that we're
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
not waiting such exorian amounts of time
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
that it's a it could be putting somebody
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
in danger and I think there's a lot of
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
discretion and to if an emergency
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
experte hearing is going to be issued
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
right but I think also we've got to keep
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
in mind that if it is over a year at
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
that point that one parent kept the
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
child from the other parent that parents
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
missed all that time and that child if
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're young they're going to be
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable probably going to that
 
04:39:02.109 --> 04:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
other parents house they've they've
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
experienced alienation at that point so
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
a lot really at stake and that was why I
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important that these issues
 
04:39:11.310 --> 04:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
are addressed quickly and timely yeah
 
04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
especially for the the visitation piece
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
vers some of the other pieces may not be
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
as important to quickly address right
 
04:39:17.840 --> 04:39:20.590 align:start position:0%
as important to quickly address right
thank

04:39:20.590 --> 04:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
you sing No Hands Up thank you so much
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and the chair
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes Dana albrech who
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
one

04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again Dana alre uh
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is desperately needed if there
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
was a single Bill other than perhaps the
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
Shared Parenting that we could get past
 
04:39:52.590 --> 04:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
this would be it uh in my
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
opinion uh I am one of these cases I saw
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
my oldest son last night because he
 
04:40:00.350 --> 04:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
lives with
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
me uh I've seen my younger children
 
04:40:07.150 --> 04:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps a grand total of 30 40 days
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
total uh over the past 7 years and
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's not because that's what the
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
parenting plan said it gave me
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
substantially more time it simply wasn't
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
followed uh also in my specific
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
case uh I've had a contempt motion filed
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say November 1st
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
2019 uh no hearing was ever held on that
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
to get even an order on it took several
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
years and on appeal to the New Hampshire
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
state supreme court to construe the
 
04:40:45.240 --> 04:40:46.990 align:start position:0%
state supreme court to construe the
existing

04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
statute uh they said that was
 
04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
essentially okay because of the way the
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
existing statute was written which says
 
04:41:02.030 --> 04:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.040 --> 04:41:03.628 align:start position:0%
 
statute

04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:08.110 align:start position:0%
statute
um

04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
just to
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
Echo um replica tab
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
when the the real need for timeliness
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
here is and then when you go too long
 
04:41:23.948 --> 04:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
without following the plan then you
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
start getting all these other
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
issues like uh pick your name
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
estrangement alienation but kids just
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
let's just say kids aren't are used to
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
only seeing one parent without laying
 
04:41:44.350 --> 04:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
blame and that creates even more
 
04:41:44.360 --> 04:41:46.670 align:start position:0%
blame and that creates even more
problems

04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
without going into the details of some
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the other case types I think some
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
other case types in the court system are
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
getting much higher priority at the
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
expense of
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
this and kids need their parents if
 
04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
there's not a really good
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
reason for them not to be with them and
 
04:42:13.760 --> 04:42:14.590 align:start position:0%
reason for them not to be with them and
to

04:42:14.590 --> 04:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
allow a child to go years without seeing
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
a parent because it's not a priority on
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
the court docket is just wrong it needs
 
04:42:28.270 --> 04:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
to be the highest priority on the court
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
stocket that's all I have to say thank
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
you I'm trusting with the seven new
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
judges being being appointed and it
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
looks like we may be getting seven or
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
more in the next budget I'm hoping some
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
of these backlogs will go away but I
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
agree with you yeah any questions for uh
 
04:42:49.080 --> 04:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
agree with you yeah any questions for uh
Mr

04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
albrech and thank you very much and
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
thank you when you uh gave testimony to
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
the special committee as
 
04:42:59.958 --> 04:43:02.430 align:start position:0%
the special committee as
well

04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
recognizes well here we go again I can
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
read the ZIP code uh Mr Atkinson would
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
you please come forward counselor and
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
help me get the name and I apologize
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
sorry it's um my name is Jame marel and
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
Jame Mark Cal yes my handwriting is God
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
awful and I I I apologize for it that's
 
04:43:36.670 --> 04:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
all right but you do zip codes great
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's zip code is correct yeah um
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
I first as an opening statement I'll
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief I certainly
 
04:43:48.750 --> 04:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the a the agony that parent
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
that that parental disputes create I'm
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
certainly sensitive to what was said
 
04:43:56.670 --> 04:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
before about the need for appropriate
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of parenting plans the one
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
thing is is that when I look at the
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
proposals in this statute a lot of them
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
already exist and simply need
 
04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh you have broad broad
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
remedies do already exist in the system
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
461a uh deals uh basically with
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
modifications of parenting plans and it
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
also uh has a couple of flaws in it but
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a little ahead of myself
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
because what we have is actually can be
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
addressed in an upcoming coming bill
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed on contempt and
 
04:44:39.628 --> 04:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
with just a few amendments you can
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
really put some teeth into parenting
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
plans uh I'm thinking of
 
04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and I really don't want to get ahead
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1192 FN which the
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
committee May address in its discretion
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
at some future time dealing with
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:08.390 align:start position:0%
at some future time dealing with
contempt

04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.788 --> 04:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know when it's slated to be
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
heard I don't either yeah and I know
 
04:45:12.830 --> 04:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm not supposed to be addressing
 
04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
bills that are presently not in front of
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee so um just a couple of
 
04:45:20.830 --> 04:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
concerns here number one is is that it
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
really doesn't this would be difficult
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
to plead effectively because it doesn't
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
Define what what a contempt is uh
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
basically contempts are in the state of
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire contempts are defined
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
basically as willful and intentional
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
Disobedience to a statute um New
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire case law stands for the
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
proposition that uh it's going to be a
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
willful Disobedience to a valid court
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
order and I think we can add unequivocal
 
04:45:53.830 --> 04:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
comp coupled with an ability to comply
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
with a court order so we don't have a
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the way courts are going
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
to plead these cases uh willful
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
Disobedience as I said voluntary and
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
intentional not act
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
accidental um the other thing is you
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't really show what the standard of
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
proof is going to be to be able to show
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
somebody is in contempt generally
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
speaking the standard is uh
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence however
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
when I look at some of the protocols for
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
parenting and things like that looking
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
at Family Court protocol rules which are
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
considered best practices but not Bing
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
on the court you look and you find
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's clear and convincing and
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
then sometimes the word une
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
unequivocal is used so this is this bill
 
04:46:39.708 --> 04:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
as it stands presently is going to
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
present problems for pleadings uh the
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
other things are that um in terms of
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
service uh a copy of and I'm looking at
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
section three a copy of the motion shall
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
be personally served upon respondent Pro
 
04:46:56.830 --> 04:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
personal process server or as provided
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
by law or by any Sheriff procedurally
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
speaking uh there are two ways you can
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
look at it one if you're bringing a new
 
04:47:06.190 --> 04:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
case on petition for contempt typically
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
once they're filed they come with
 
04:47:09.788 --> 04:47:09.798 align:start position:0%
instructions for service by the
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
petitioner or plaintiff and they tell
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
them how to do it right in there and
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh right the notice from the court
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
and they give them dates to serve and
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
they say it's going to have to be served
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
by a sheriff uh so they have
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
instructions in there uh the because
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a little schizophrenic but
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the nature of things if you have an
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
existing case and you file a motion for
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
contempt service on a party or by mail
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
is usually sufficient um or it can be in
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
hand where where whereas when you're
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
bringing a new petition or a new case or
 
04:47:48.548 --> 04:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
opening another case for a petition for
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
contempt uh and if I'm straying here
 
04:47:53.708 --> 04:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
please bring me back in So when you
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
bring a new petition for a case you were
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
required to make inhan service and that
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
differs from a bode service primarily
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
due to the nature of uh the proing
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
itself because it can result in
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
incarceration the um speaking of
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration this bill does not refer
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
to incarceration as a potential penalty
 
04:48:18.548 --> 04:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
um frankly I think it's a deterrent
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
effect uh to include possible
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration for willful non-compliance
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
of court orders um this is going to
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
sound a little bit strange perhaps but
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
there may simply not but there is a
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
reluctance on the behalf of the
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in my opinion to um issue what
 
04:48:39.548 --> 04:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
are called show cause orders unless the
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
behaviors is very egregious um if you
 
04:48:45.310 --> 04:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
have the kind of egregious behavior I'm
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
hearing as been testified to
 
04:48:50.270 --> 04:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration May simply be a remedy now
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
incarceration is not meant to be
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
punitive but it's B to do two things
 
04:48:56.670 --> 04:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
first if it's a civil contempt as this
 
04:48:59.548 --> 04:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
is very well may be it's usually
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
designed to uh Co it's coercive in
 
04:49:05.310 --> 04:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
nature and the idea of a contempt is
 
04:49:07.708 --> 04:49:07.718 align:start position:0%
coercive to bring that party in
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
compliance now uh and if it's a civil
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
cont if it's a criminal contempt it's
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
usually done to vindicate the authority
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
of the Court um and they have a
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
completely different set of due process
 
04:49:24.030 --> 04:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
standards so I think this could be
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
clarified and I think what the intent of
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
this could be done could be to roll this
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
in to um into the upcoming bill and when
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
I think it comes time I see I think you
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
would see that with a couple of small
 
04:49:38.548 --> 04:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
amendments it could be done fairly
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
easily the other part of it is is that
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
um you don't want to paint yourself I
 
04:49:46.030 --> 04:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we we if we're interested in
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
the administration of justice want to
 
04:49:50.830 --> 04:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
paint ourselves into a corner uh which
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
means that this is the sole remedy and
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it in the statute it's
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
not there um other things to look at are
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the things that are already in this
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
statute already exist as Equitable
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
remedies uh within with with a court can
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
do okay so when you're looking at Upon A
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
finding I'm assuming you would want uh
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence uh a court
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
May order remedies which are can you can
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
certainly have compensatory
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
visitation uh you can certainly order
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
this on an uh to educate the Violator
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
about the importance of providing that
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
but that could be done on a case-by
 
04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
casee basis and that's within the scope
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
of Equitable remedies courts can do that
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
um uh assessment of fines um courts can
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
already order um courts can already
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
order payment of costs which include a
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
variety of things depending upon the
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
egregious nature of the contempt um I'm
 
04:51:01.628 --> 04:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
not so sure about a bond although I
 
04:51:03.868 --> 04:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
don't it's not terrible but the
 
04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable expenses of denial are
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
already I think within a Court's ability
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
04:51:11.280 --> 04:51:13.430 align:start position:0%
to do it
um

04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's kind of it um
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's I think well intentioned but I
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
think this is already States what a
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
court can do and I think it needs some
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think it can be worked into
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
another bill easily I'd be happy to take
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
any questions uh for the audience
 
04:51:37.788 --> 04:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
purposes both here and viewing uh it is
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
my custom when we have a time limit to
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
give a much broader time limit to a
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
person who is in opposition generally to
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that makes it fair we have
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
two equal times then anyone else
 
04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
testifying however they uh wish
 
04:51:57.788 --> 04:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
whichever side uh goes on the clock so
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
for those of you wondering why um you
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
were allowed much greater time that is
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
why oh
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
any uh question representative McMahon
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
chairman attorney is it marel or marel
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
maral maral thank you sir as long as
 
04:52:15.548 --> 04:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
it's not late for dinner
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm understood attorney maral I
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your description on the
 
04:52:24.788 --> 04:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
interpretation of uh penalties for La of
 
04:52:28.230 --> 04:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
a better term um under Section Five uh
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
within the proposed Bill and you did
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
refer to line 27 briefly mhm but but in
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
the last line where it does give the
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
court of law the powers relating to
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
penalties of contempt would that uh does
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
that not speak to given that flexibility
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
based on the interpretation dur of the
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the court on what an what an
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate U um remedy punishment or
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
remedy would would be good question the
 
04:53:00.510 --> 04:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
answer is yes and no like most things in
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
law let me explain uh it's unfortunately
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
true uh so for example um personally not
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
enough people are aware of the fact that
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh that they that if you're in contempt
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
of court you can be incarcerated for
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
violation of a court order and frankly I
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
think it satisfies notice an opportunity
 
04:53:25.030 --> 04:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be heard and particularly notice as
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
to what the sanctions are that you
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
better think twice before you start
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
violating court orders so the remedies
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
may include incarceration is not
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
available that idea so for example when
 
04:53:38.750 --> 04:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
you look and they and so for example
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
when you look at a Massachusetts summons
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
to appear on a contempt action the
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
summons also indicates for which you may
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated okay so in other words
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
if it goes into the law that you may be
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people presume to know the
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
law I think would look at that and say
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
maybe I'd better think twice before I
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
started violating it because right now
 
04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
um people violate orders and they do it
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
and because there are no consequences no
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
discernable consequences and I'm not
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
saying you incarcerate people for no
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
reason whatever but I can but and but
 
04:54:18.548 --> 04:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
the process is usually this if somebody
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
files for a contempt all right and if
 
04:54:24.430 --> 04:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
the behavior is sufficiently or if the
 
04:54:26.430 --> 04:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
conduct is sufficiently
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
egregious uh what you would find is the
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
court will then if it's by a judge uh
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
put the case on for what's called a show
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
cause hearing and a show cause is you'd
 
04:54:39.310 --> 04:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
better tell us why you ought not to be
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
held you ought not to be taken into
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
custody uh and that's usually the way it
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
works so I'm a fan of including
 
04:54:49.150 --> 04:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration in there because it may
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
well give people notice and uh May
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
prevent a lot of the contumacious
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
conduct that
 
04:54:59.350 --> 04:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
occurs one followup one follow up thank
 
04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
you just one attorney marel um
 
04:55:05.230 --> 04:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your guide in that regard and
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
specific to that uh with the existing
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
law being in play as you described is it
 
04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
not redundant then to put it into
 
04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
another bill or is that yes it is it
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
redundant redundant and it's done
 
04:55:24.670 --> 04:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
because of prosay this is for for easier
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
access for Citizens utilizing this
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
versus using an attorney well you don't
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
really I get it good question um it's
 
04:55:34.750 --> 04:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
good that that provides notice but this
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
these are already existing remedies okay
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
so for example the one thing about
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
divorce law and family law is that
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
basically these are what are called
 
04:55:45.910 --> 04:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
Equitable proceedings and Equitable
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
proceedings means that the court can do
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
what's right just or Fair uh you know
 
04:55:52.750 --> 04:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
some of the complaints that we hear
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
going up are for example uh from an AG
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
grieved party on a divorce proceeding is
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
the Court ruled this way and I disagree
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
with it but as long as there's an
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
objective basis below okay the the
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
actions taken below assuming they're
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
within bounds are going to be affirmed
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
on appeal now to directly answer that
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
Equitable remedies what's right what's
 
04:56:17.670 --> 04:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
just what's fair okay so if you're an AG
 
04:56:19.868 --> 04:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
grieved party a court can already do
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
this and uh so it's going to be what are
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
what remedies are and that's what they
 
04:56:29.430 --> 04:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
are I hope I answered that question if
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
not please ask me
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
another any further questions
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
repres uh chair Vice chairman L uh thank
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh attorney Markel do do
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
you have articulated or written uh to
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
what you would recommend we look at um
 
04:56:49.708 --> 04:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
you yes well already okay well I'll tell
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
you what I do have that might be helpful
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
to you and I'm jumping the gun a little
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
here because I have a presentation I'm
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
finishing up for the next bill that's
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
coming up um what I planned to do was
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
bring in a copy of an ambiguous court
 
04:57:07.628 --> 04:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
order okay that supports the notion that
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
contempts need to be unambiguous number
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
one number two I have a I'm going to I
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
plan to present a redacted order for a
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
show cause hearing to show you what the
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
egregious nature of conduct really is
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
from a real Court in a recent hearing uh
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
to show you what would be worthy of
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration number three I have a i i
 
04:57:31.948 --> 04:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
in November of
 
04:57:34.548 --> 04:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
2023 I published a New Hampshire Barn
 
04:57:37.230 --> 04:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
news article on this on the necessity of
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
putting a statute forward uh which
 
04:57:41.628 --> 04:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
briefly summarizes the history of
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
contempt and I do have copies of that
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
for you right now if you would like to
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
see them uh of that particular article
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
which summarizes content would you like
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
me to get them uh after you're done you
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
can hand them to representative Bickford
 
04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um one followup one
 
04:57:59.868 --> 04:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
followup we're going to be moving on
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
then uh with respect to uh this this
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
appeals RSA uh
 
04:58:12.270 --> 04:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
461 a colon 4 a mhm um which any motion
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
for contemporary
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh of an order shall be
 
04:58:18.030 --> 04:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed within 30 days correct yeah do
 
04:58:21.750 --> 04:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
you see is this is this minimizing
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
what's current there or do they pretty
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
much look the same well it's it's going
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
to minimize it the one thing is that we
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
do have some redundancies uh built into
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
statute we have RSA for 58 I think it's
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
51 which deals with contempt but does
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
not define what a contempt is it says
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
contempt in domestic relations matter
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then Awards attorneys fees where
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
where takes away discretion legislature
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
takes away judicial discretion and says
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
on a finding of contempt the court shall
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
award uh attorneys fees and
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
costs um so we can alter that the other
 
04:59:00.990 --> 04:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
Pro the other thing is is that you have
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say it's RSA I'm going to
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
say 461 a15 I think it's 15 I'm not sure
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
where it says a party who with
 
04:59:13.150 --> 04:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonably fails to comply with a
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
court order okay
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh gets themselves in trouble now
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's the difference between the
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonably fails to follow standard
 
04:59:23.360 --> 04:59:24.230 align:start position:0%
unreasonably fails to follow standard
and

04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
content uh unreasonable fails to follow
 
04:59:29.070 --> 04:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
is vager it's a little
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
softer um but it do and it does not NE
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily address the same issue
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
because they're two completely different
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
things okay you know the difference for
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
example between a motion to enforce
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily be a willful and
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
intentional act the other thing that we
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
don't have here is is that whether or
 
04:59:51.310 --> 04:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
not you have an ability to comply either
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
past or present so in the future
 
04:59:56.430 --> 04:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
proposed statute we have an ability to
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
comply uh so that narrows the pleadings
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
and a prosay who looks at that okay and
 
05:00:05.948 --> 05:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
a lawyer who looks at that can then say
 
05:00:08.548 --> 05:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
okay this is how I plead my case a pro
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
can look at it and say this is how I
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
plead my case you know they did this
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
they did this they did this and they had
 
05:00:15.510 --> 05:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to comply and they didn't
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
comply or it was this this and this and
 
05:00:19.470 --> 05:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
this and you can sign off on it judges
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
will no longer have to Cobble together
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
and go to and go to case law and look at
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
protocols to be able to Cobble together
 
05:00:28.948 --> 05:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
something because they can look right at
 
05:00:31.150 --> 05:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
the statute and say this is what it is
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
you're in contempt or you're not in
 
05:00:32.480 --> 05:00:34.590 align:start position:0%
you're in contempt or you're not in
contempt

05:00:34.590 --> 05:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
contempt
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you good thank you thank you
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and now we uh having
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
heard the prime sponsor and having heard
 
05:00:46.350 --> 05:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
one who checked his card as opposition
 
05:00:48.750 --> 05:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've got the remaining cards and we
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
will be going into a 3 minute and 30
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
second drill and we've already seen how
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
good we are at that and the chair
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes again uh Mr Tim
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
penac P sir
 
05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
pen a saac pen a saac yes okay so a soft
 
05:01:10.830 --> 05:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
SE got it okay thank you thank you uh
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Parsons I appreciate
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
your time uh again um I won't for the
 
05:01:16.830 --> 05:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
sake of brevity I will not repeat some
 
05:01:19.230 --> 05:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
of the issues associated with my
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
particular case the challenge as similar
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
to Mr Al's situation is all of this is
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
great and good except when the excuse my
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
vacular because I spent 11 years in the
 
05:01:32.910 --> 05:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
military when the rubber hits the road
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
because the impact of what actually
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
happens versus the spinning of language
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a very difficult situation for a
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
parent who is fighting to get their
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
children my ex-wife was a arrested in
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
December I filed immedately an exp parte
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
motion um the the motion was was denied
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
and then they assigned a hearing 90 days
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
she was arrested for failure to comply
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
with um the inter appearance um uh
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
statute it was the misdemeanor side not
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
the not the um not the felony side she
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
refused to exchange the children right
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing was set 90 days out we got
 
05:02:18.430 --> 05:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
in we got in the process of getting the
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
hearing so I lost my kids for n for 90
 
05:02:23.590 --> 05:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
days God in the process of the hearing
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
her attorney filed for a
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
continuance and that continuance was
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
pushed another 90 days so I was six
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
months without seeing you know arguably
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
two of my three kids my eldest my eldest
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
son was away in college um at that point
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
in time my ex-wife had imparted a level
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
of I'll use the term brainwashing on my
 
05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
daughters my son came to live with me
 
05:02:48.910 --> 05:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
because he was suffering so much from
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse and that he was he was
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat suicidal so the issue at hand
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
is the timing of things in the forcing
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
the court to move rapidly and quickly in
 
05:03:04.590 --> 05:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
order to address these issues that is my
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
challenge with this W with the fact that
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
if we split hairs on the language we're
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
not moving quickly the court needs to
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
move quickly the court needs to
 
05:03:15.310 --> 05:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what the penalties
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
are put in place and make that happen
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
because as it was I was seen by marital
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
Master dpra there's a situation with
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
marital Master dpra he resigned we were
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
assigned another judge and then it was a
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
year a year until from the incident
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
until we had a meaningful Hearing in
 
05:03:39.150 --> 05:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
front of the court right I I am now 3
 
05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
years into that my daughters come back
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
to me for a periods periods of time I
 
05:03:46.030 --> 05:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
was given at the beginning of the of of
 
05:03:49.628 --> 05:03:49.638 align:start position:0%
the divorce a 50-50 relationship I have
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
my girls I see my girls about 25% of the
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
time 20% of the time at best now we are
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
third year into it we are waiting from
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
the order from the court that happened
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
in November 20 that hearing happened in
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
November 22nd of last year still don't
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
have that hearing out right I'm
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
expecting fully expecting after a g was
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
involved in all a lot of infighting
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
associated to this that the court will
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
award back to 5050 30 seconds yes sir
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so we are three years into
 
05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
this and guess what happened yesterday
 
05:04:22.270 --> 05:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
she violated the the parenting order not
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
the agreement the parenting order from
 
05:04:25.628 --> 05:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
the court last night she refused to
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
exchange the girls so I'm back into the
 
05:04:30.990 --> 05:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
same situation the challenge is the
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
timing of the Court the timing of being
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
able to effectively say stop it you know
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
this both parents have time with their
 
05:04:42.430 --> 05:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
children you cannot do this I agree the
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
the idea of incarceration that'd be a
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing but truly do I want my
 
05:04:49.470 --> 05:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
do my daughter's um mother arrested and
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
thrown in jail that's going to make the
 
05:04:53.990 --> 05:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
situation much worse for me personally
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think there's a balance of
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
following the court or following the law
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
and the reality of a parent working with
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
their children thank you sir thank you
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
sir any
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for bringing
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
this before us you've dramatized well
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
the Need for Speed thank you sir and Mr
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.190 --> 05:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
me excuse me thank you um I'm asking
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
your guys' help uh with some questions I
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
I do know quite a bit about uh family
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
cour Court uh rule 1.2 right if you read
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
the family court rules rule
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
1.2 a judge May
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
wave upon good cause any rule that's
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
right unless prohibited by law so I'm in
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because it kind of
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
guides but also
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
restrains the very very
 
05:05:59.070 --> 05:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
new judges in a very very new court
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
system special Court Family Court
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
created in 2005 the Family Division the
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
family court was created in
 
05:06:08.590 --> 05:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
2011 and it's basically been terrorizing
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
Pro lians since its
 
05:06:10.958 --> 05:06:14.030 align:start position:0%
Pro lians since its
Inception

05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to speak about 633 colon 4
 
05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
interference with custody there is a
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense in which you hide
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
the children uh from a parent and you
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
can argue that 633 is actually it say if
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
you read the language a a parent if that
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
that means even if you have court
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
orders saying that there's custody at
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
this time but if you hide the
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
location I assert that you have the
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
right to know where your children are at
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
any point in time so it's a felony when
 
05:06:50.788 --> 05:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
it's over the state and there's no
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
justification not preventing the abuse
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
of the child nothing you have to within
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
72 hours if you're going to hide the
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
location of a child from a parent which
 
05:07:03.310 --> 05:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
happened in my case with a police
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
officer uh and the police don't do
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
anything about it it you the amount of
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
pain that someone suffers when they're
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
children are removed from
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
their understanding you can see this
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
in slips uh permission slips you can't
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
take your children the school can't take
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
their children on a field trip you have
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
to know where your children are at all
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
times and that's the the way it works so
 
05:07:31.948 --> 05:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
this bill gives the court clear
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines lines and the litigant clear
 
05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines to do a
 
05:07:41.470 --> 05:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
simple procedure and the court does
 
05:07:44.070 --> 05:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
have decision-making ability whether or
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
not to impose that fine and and so they
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
do have but it they can't wave that
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
right where if you file contemp motions
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
I file contemp motions just not
 
05:07:58.270 --> 05:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
regarding to this um it's it's an
 
05:08:00.150 --> 05:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
important bill uh I do not think that
 
05:08:02.670 --> 05:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
there should be jail time put on that uh
 
05:08:04.708 --> 05:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
because then that leaves the court to
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
abuse a unpreferred litigant yeah to
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
jail time is it's a it's a big thing man
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have to really do a crime and if you
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
read the legal statutes um 30 seconds
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will uh state that in my
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
case uh so when you look at 173b is
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional right of the accused um
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's domestic violence protection uh
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
and 633 col 4 is a form of domestic
 
05:08:31.600 --> 05:08:32.788 align:start position:0%
and 633 col 4 is a form of domestic
violence

05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
when you're ordered to do things uh with
 
05:08:36.798 --> 05:08:38.070 align:start position:0%
when you're ordered to do things uh with
the

05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
court I'm going to run out of time uh so
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have to save that for later
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
but I do support this bill um I don't
 
05:08:47.270 --> 05:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
really see any amendments that are
 
05:08:49.510 --> 05:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
necessary and I'm open to any questions
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
that you might have about 633 col 4 or
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
the court rules contempt process because
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
I am familiar with that sure any
 
05:08:59.708 --> 05:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
tangu come on guys all right it's the
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%

05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
testimony children need timely responses
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to time with their parents
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
and to me one of the basic things that
 
05:09:49.310 --> 05:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
this bill provides since which I really
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
support is that it provides a shortened
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
time for delay anytime the parents are
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
not sharing equally so uh the RSA Force
 
05:10:02.120 --> 05:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
not sharing equally so uh the RSA Force
61

05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
61
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
a4a is repealed by this bill uh by this
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm sorry I'm really
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
nervous RSA 461 a4a is any motion for
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
contempt or enforcement of an order
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
regarding an approved parenting plan
 
05:10:25.230 --> 05:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
under this chapter if filed by a parent
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
05:10:30.510 --> 05:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the court within 30 days
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's two real problems with with that
 
05:10:35.470 --> 05:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
little paragraph it only says they're
 
05:10:37.150 --> 05:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
going to review it doesn't say they're
 
05:10:40.110 --> 05:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
going to do anything about it and it's
 
05:10:43.390 --> 05:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
within 30 days and unfortunately we know
 
05:10:46.270 --> 05:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
the 30 days usually lengthens and can
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
turn into 90 which can turn into
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
months so this bill is specific IT
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
addresses with a fast response 10 days
 
05:11:00.548 --> 05:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
is a much better
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
response and it's addressing an issue
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
that police always tell
 
05:11:09.150 --> 05:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
me if somebody calls me because their
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
other parent won't give their child up
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can't do anything and one of the
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
Chiefs said to me I'm not going to take
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
a child who doesn't want to go well that
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
puts him in the position of being a
 
05:11:24.430 --> 05:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
psychologist because we all know
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
children have to uh live with the person
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
whoever they're living with they're
 
05:11:31.628 --> 05:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
definitely going to want to please
 
05:11:34.548 --> 05:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
because it's painful if you don't so it
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't put a policeman in this
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
position of deciding whether or not that
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
should be decided by the parenting plan
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
so if they won't enforce it if child
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to go the police say to the
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
parent and I've heard this many times
 
05:11:53.230 --> 05:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
this is a court matter okay you've
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
already been to court you have your
 
05:11:55.480 --> 05:11:56.708 align:start position:0%
already been to court you have your
parenting

05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
plan why do you have to go back to court
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
to get a another parenting plan well
 
05:12:04.470 --> 05:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
apparently you have to go back to court
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
to file for contempt okay that's another
 
05:12:11.350 --> 05:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
huge delay of time and what are you
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to do find the other parent guilty
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
and put him in
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
jail this is a much more humane way to
 
05:12:20.830 --> 05:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
deal with the situation there's lots
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
more things than being put in jail found
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
being found in
 
05:12:30.110 --> 05:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
contempt it's reasonable and it's fast
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's fast response and it meanwhile it
 
05:12:36.548 --> 05:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
means the children are denied did not
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
denied being with both parents so I
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
think this is a wonderful bill and I
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
hope it passes thank you will you take
 
05:12:48.510 --> 05:12:48.520 align:start position:0%

05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%

family law committee again for the
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Kaitlyn
 
05:24:38.310 --> 05:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
cab I'm here to introduce a bill
 
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
relative to child support
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
guidelines just to give a brief history
 
05:24:45.548 --> 05:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
2007 there was a legislative change that
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
we could not
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
deviate from the child support
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on shared parenting
 
05:24:55.840 --> 05:24:58.230 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on shared parenting
time

05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
and after that happened the first report
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
that came out after that the child
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
support quadrennial report in 2009
 
05:25:07.470 --> 05:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
immediately changed recommended making
 
05:25:10.350 --> 05:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
changes to kind of change that back and
 
05:25:13.150 --> 05:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
then also in 2018 and 2022 in those
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
reports they've also recommended that we
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
really need to make changes for this so
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
I saw that lots of bills have been in
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
put in over the years to try and address
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
this and each year they've been ited so
 
05:25:26.070 --> 05:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
this summer I
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
worked with several of the stakeholders
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
who have previously opposed ones that
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
have previously supported and tried to
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
come together with a bill that everybody
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
could agree on so it was in conjunction
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
with working with several family law
 
05:25:40.638 --> 05:25:42.230 align:start position:0%
with working with several family law
attorneys

05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
mediators um particularly one gentleman
 
05:25:49.868 --> 05:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
here uh Anthony uh matalo he is is here
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
to testify as well help to work on this
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
language and I think it's something that
 
05:25:56.430 --> 05:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on also uh did speak
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Legal Aid on this as
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
well and uh New Hampshire Association of
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
justice so
 
05:26:07.948 --> 05:26:07.958 align:start position:0%
um when that happened some of the judges
 
05:26:07.958 --> 05:26:09.548 align:start position:0%
um when that happened some of the judges
did

05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:26:11.830 --> 05:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
immediately listen to that statutory
 
05:26:13.868 --> 05:26:13.878 align:start position:0%
change but some did not and some
 
05:26:16.350 --> 05:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
continued to deviate anyway and so some
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
of the cases became challenged so the uh
 
05:26:23.310 --> 05:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
Silva V Silva case in 2018 upheld that
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
again the legis the the statue states
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
that you can't deviate based on shared
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
parenting time and so when that came the
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
judges could no longer
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
deviate when the Anderson case came in
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
2019 which was argued
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
because they had initially deviated and
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
then when the case came back up when
 
05:26:44.990 --> 05:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
when they had divorced in 2011 there had
 
05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
been a deviation based on shared
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
parenting time but then in 2017 in 2017
 
05:26:52.150 --> 05:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
when they came forward they didn't allow
 
05:26:54.030 --> 05:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
for a deviation when the review of the
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
child support came forward so in 2019
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
they stated we're going to leave this to
 
05:27:00.030 --> 05:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature to fix that was from the
 
05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
court hearing so I think you
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
know judges are looking to us to help
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
them out with this as well so what this
 
05:27:08.350 --> 05:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill does is it
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
incorporates to allow for some deviation
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
based on shared parenting time and it
 
05:27:14.590 --> 05:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
also increases the self-support reserve
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
from 115% to 130% which has long been
 
05:27:20.430 --> 05:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
recommended to change and is changed in
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
many other states so what this does is
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
that if you have approximately equal
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
parenting time which means greater than
 
05:27:29.920 --> 05:27:31.110 align:start position:0%
parenting time which means greater than
40%

05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
40%
 
05:27:34.110 --> 05:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
which equates to
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
having approximately 5 days over a twoe
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
period plus 26 days over vacation time
 
05:27:43.230 --> 05:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
such as you know uh
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
December uh February and April vacations
 
05:27:48.750 --> 05:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
and the summer vacation and
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
so and that you have approximately equal
 
05:27:54.910 --> 05:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
income which is within 10% of each other
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
then there's an understanding a
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption a rebuttable
 
05:27:59.788 --> 05:27:59.798 align:start position:0%
presumption so there may be other
 
05:28:01.390 --> 05:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances why this this wouldn't
 
05:28:05.470 --> 05:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
happen but a rebuttable presumption that
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
a$0 child support
 
05:28:10.030 --> 05:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
obligation would be appropriate and the
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
reason for that is right now if you if
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
you do if you're sharing 50/50 parenting
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
time and your child support let's say
 
05:28:20.270 --> 05:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
parent A's child support order uh comes
 
05:28:22.510 --> 05:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
out to $2,000 and parent B's child
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
support order comes out to 2005 that's
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
out of the calculator how much it
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
calculates what their shared child
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
support amount would be
 
05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
what's happening today is parent B that
 
05:28:35.230 --> 05:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
came up with a
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
$205 they would have to pay parent a
 
05:28:41.548 --> 05:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
$2,005 the full amount and so then they
 
05:28:43.390 --> 05:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
are unable to afford a lot of their
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
expenses it's you're on very un even
 
05:28:47.350 --> 05:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
playing Ground at that point so this
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
this seeks to help to remedy that and it
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
gives a few other scenarios as well
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
where deviations may make sense and
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
again these are rebuttable presumptions
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
and there
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
is language in here for reason about why
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
it some of these may not make sense such
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
as significant health issues long
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
distances between the parents or
 
05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
unpredictable work schedules or in cases
 
05:29:11.830 --> 05:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
where there's evidence of abuse as
 
05:29:15.470 --> 05:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 173b col
 
05:29:20.190 --> 05:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
um approximately or sorry so uh
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
substantially shared parenting schedule
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
was defined as greater than 35% and the
 
05:29:29.470 --> 05:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
reason of importance of putting that in
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
was if parents don't live very close and
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
the kids can't go back and forth on
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
school nights what that equated to was 4
 
05:29:38.470 --> 05:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
days over a 2E period plus additional
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
time during summer and school vacations
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
would would equal that 35% there
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
so those are really the things that are
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
changing again just giving some
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumptions to allow for for
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
deviations with the Shared Parenting and
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
then increasing that self support
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
Reserve which has been recommended to be
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
changed for quite some time I'm happy to
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
I may have heard this incorrectly or not
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
no was being the choices but um did you
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
say that um the impetus behind this bill
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
here was from uh some members of the
 
05:30:15.628 --> 05:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so it it's been actually
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
recommended in a few different so in the
 
05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
Anderson case what they said was we'll
 
05:30:23.070 --> 05:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
leave that to the legislature to change
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
if they'd like to um let me tell you
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
what the exact wording was let me see if
 
05:30:31.430 --> 05:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
I can quickly pull up the case but um no
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
the I think the push to change this was
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
really from the quadral reports and when
 
05:30:39.150 --> 05:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
they took quite a bit of the
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony what they heard was many
 
05:30:44.670 --> 05:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
afford to have an
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
equal um standard of living for the kids
 
05:30:53.350 --> 05:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
when they're paying so much and they
 
05:30:55.230 --> 05:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
make about the same as the other parent
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
makes it's it's creating for really
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
uneven footing and so as a quadrennial
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
reports that ultim recommended the
 
05:31:04.230 --> 05:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
change but also
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
um in the Anderson case they said
 
05:31:09.430 --> 05:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
accordingly we leave this is issue to
 
05:31:12.430 --> 05:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature so they left it to us to
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
decide if we wanted to fix it or not
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
else seeing nobody else thank you so
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes um Anthony
 
05:31:29.160 --> 05:31:30.830 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes um Anthony
matalo

05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
matalo
 
05:31:33.628 --> 05:31:33.638 align:start position:0%
I have an Italian language speak coach
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
here uh it's the next to the last
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
syllable How how how do I do he's going
 
05:31:38.000 --> 05:31:39.270 align:start position:0%
syllable How how how do I do he's going
to

05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:31:43.590 --> 05:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
tell much family mediator from Derry
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
he's from the North End of Boston Jo I
 
05:31:48.590 --> 05:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for allowing me to
 
05:31:48.600 --> 05:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for allowing me to
testify

05:31:49.750 --> 05:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
today um so I'm a family mediator I've
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
been a family mediator for about 10
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
years a little over 10 years and I've
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
worked with about 800 families um that
 
05:32:05.788 --> 05:32:05.798 align:start position:0%
have worked that have struggled with
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
this issue of Child
 
05:32:10.830 --> 05:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Support um the current law when I'm
 
05:32:13.230 --> 05:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
working with people in my office the
 
05:32:15.548 --> 05:32:15.558 align:start position:0%
current law I can work with the current
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
law but there are contradictions in the
 
05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
current law that when people are um
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
litigating or or not not able to reach
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
agreement there is there are there are
 
05:32:32.190 --> 05:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
contradictions in the current law that
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
lead to unjust results I will tell you
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
that in the 800 cases that I've worked
 
05:32:42.990 --> 05:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
on 800 or so cases I have never uh
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
failed to be able to or my clients have
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
never failed to be able to reach a
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
settlement on child support it isn't
 
05:32:54.590 --> 05:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
that it's easy it isn't that it's um uh
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
that there's clear guidance in the
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
current law but what what happens in
 
05:33:02.070 --> 05:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
that office is that mothers and fathers
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
use common sense they apply common sense
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with an order so what this
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
bill when I was asked to to contribute
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
to this bill pretty much what I did
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
these were not my ideas these were the
 
05:33:17.548 --> 05:33:17.558 align:start position:0%
ideas of 800 New Hampshire families
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
who've settled this issue it's not
 
05:33:22.350 --> 05:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
rocket science and if you apply common
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
sense it works so what this bill is a
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
representation of those of of those
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
families uh
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
criteria pretty simple to explain if you
 
05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
have two people who two parents who earn
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money and they have
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
the kids the same amount of time there's
 
05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
generally and they're splitting other
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
expenses no child support going back and
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
forth right they have equal resources
 
05:33:49.708 --> 05:33:49.718 align:start position:0%
equal expenses around the kids if you
 
05:33:51.990 --> 05:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a case where one person earns a lot
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
more than the other person and has the
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
kids less amount of the time so less
 
05:34:00.270 --> 05:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
than a than a substantially shared
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule in that case the
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
guideline should apply in cases where
 
05:34:09.070 --> 05:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
you have the kids an approximately equal
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time and there's a difference
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
in incomes whatever child support is
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
paid from one parent to the other should
 
05:34:21.070 --> 05:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
not flip incomes Common Sense every one
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
of my clients agree with these standards
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
and then lastly if there's a difference
 
05:34:26.878 --> 05:34:27.670 align:start position:0%
and then lastly if there's a difference
in

05:34:27.670 --> 05:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:31.470 --> 05:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
incomes and there is not an
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting schedule
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
then a deviation from the guidelines may
 
05:34:40.230 --> 05:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
or may not be appropriate so this is
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
where parents work
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
together sometimes they deviate from the
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines and sometimes they don't and
 
05:34:49.590 --> 05:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
it gives this bill would give judges the
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
same guidelines the same bumpers in the
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
bowling alley to come to these
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
conclusions with the Paramount this bill
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
says the Paramount concern which is
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the current law on the
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of child support in New
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Paramount concern is
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
whether with a deviation from the
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines the lower earning parent can
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
provide a substantially similar standard
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
of living to the because it is the
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that what is
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
important is if children perceive that
 
05:35:24.510 --> 05:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
both parents are able to provide for
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
them and they're not living one house in
 
05:35:29.548 --> 05:35:29.558 align:start position:0%
opulence and the other house in poverty
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
so so that is what the purpose of this
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill is IT addresses I think all of the
 
05:35:35.948 --> 05:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
concerns we tried to find something in
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
the middle of the road that everybody
 
05:35:40.110 --> 05:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
could get on board with and hopefully
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
this does that and I'm happy to answer
 
05:35:46.750 --> 05:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:49.150 --> 05:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you okay
 
05:35:51.548 --> 05:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome thank you but uh if
 
05:35:54.110 --> 05:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
if you can stay around and appreciate
 
05:35:56.830 --> 05:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
that in case something comes up next um
 
05:36:02.670 --> 05:36:02.680 align:start position:0%

05:36:12.910 --> 05:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
too well I only provide the information
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
from bcss it's a small but deep part oh

we we have yes we have the big boss over
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon I'm Susan bristen I'm

Bill

05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:38.670 --> 05:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
1564 um as you know our office did the
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
quadrennial review that uh all of these
 
05:36:46.030 --> 05:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
child support bills are are based on and
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of the the major things that the
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
quadral review looked into is the the
 
05:36:55.470 --> 05:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
use of deviations in in determining
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
child support and I think that that's
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
our concern with with this bill in that
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
it calls for it actually calls for
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
deviations um which is not
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
helpful um I to the court and I also
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
believe it's not helpful to the public
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
when they're using uh these guidelines
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
they're not just for the court to figure
 
05:37:22.270 --> 05:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
out child support they're actually used
 
05:37:25.910 --> 05:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
by Council and the public when they're
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know before they bring something to
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
court to to figure out what their
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
position should be um and calling for a
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
deviation um I don't think gives any
 
05:37:40.590 --> 05:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
guidance to deviation up deviation down
 
05:37:40.600 --> 05:37:42.350 align:start position:0%
guidance to deviation up deviation down
$5

05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
$5
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
$500 um becomes an issue and and there's
 
05:37:47.230 --> 05:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
a couple different times it calls for
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
deviations I'm looking
 
05:37:48.840 --> 05:37:50.868 align:start position:0%
deviations I'm looking
at

05:37:50.868 --> 05:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:37:50.878 --> 05:37:52.788 align:start position:0%
at
page

05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:01.708 --> 05:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
four and then page two line 9 through
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
14 that whole paragraph is talking about
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
deviations the change to the self-
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
support Reserve I think was also called
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
for in the quadral review and I believe
 
05:38:26.910 --> 05:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's what's called for um in the other
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill as as well um
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that's all I
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
have any
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank
 
05:38:45.510 --> 05:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
you Miss brist is it attorney bristen it
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
is thank you want to make sure I had it
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
correct hold on think sure uh relative
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
to the de to the
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
deviation is the
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the goal being a shared expense
 
05:39:02.430 --> 05:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
but between parties earning different uh
 
05:39:06.030 --> 05:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
incomes is there a is there a uh number
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
in this in this strategy that you would
 
05:39:11.948 --> 05:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate um I think that's that's the
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
problem it's it's really hard to sort of
 
05:39:19.628 --> 05:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
figure out where where we're going to
 
05:39:22.510 --> 05:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
land um the way this is written it
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually if if you're looking at page
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
page one um line 25 child child care
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
guidelines and then adjust Ms and it
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
lays out that if you
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
have equal child care costs equal
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
uninsured medical expenses and um equal
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
agreed upon extracurricular activities
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then you have substantially similar
 
05:39:48.788 --> 05:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
incomes and approximately equal paren
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
time then we get to
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
zero so if you don't hit any of those
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're sort of not in that box to get
 
05:39:57.548 --> 05:39:57.558 align:start position:0%
zero child
 
05:40:00.510 --> 05:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
support you can then hit the boxes for
 
05:40:02.830 --> 05:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a deviation depending on depending
 
05:40:04.750 --> 05:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
on where you are and of course in a lot
 
05:40:08.190 --> 05:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
of these cases there's not agreement I
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time with pi I cover uh
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
cases in in Plymouth and Littleton and
 
05:40:16.948 --> 05:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
getting people to agree on how much they
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
spend on various things um can take a
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
while so I think the the problem with
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is that if you don't have agreement
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
then you're going to a hearing and the
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
parties don't agree and then I think we
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
sort of end up where we are now because
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of this bill doesn't change the
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines as they exist
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
right now right so I'm not sure it it
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
gives relief in those types of cases one
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair followup thank you Mr
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um attorney bristen that uh
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
with that statement being made and the a
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
previous commentary by Mr romalo hope I
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
had that right close
 
05:41:00.270 --> 05:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
enough following my chair is gu on
 
05:41:02.670 --> 05:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
vernacular we'll have language lessons
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
um uh in having a a similar from one
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
parent to the next uh living condition
 
05:41:16.590 --> 05:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
and that was described that one may not
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
be able to provide that without a
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
sustainable additional Revenue stream
 
05:41:23.310 --> 05:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend based on your
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
experience on how to achieve that goal
 
05:41:27.868 --> 05:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
so that that the Shared Parenting will
 
05:41:30.510 --> 05:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
have uh uh for the service provided to
 
05:41:34.110 --> 05:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
the subject the child will be equal or
 
05:41:36.548 --> 05:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
as close to equal between the
 
05:41:38.830 --> 05:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
parents well I think that I mean that
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
language is is helpful in that we don't
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
have it right now with dealing
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
with parents and equal type uh living
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
conditions I'm not
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
sure it it's a laudable goal I'm not
 
05:41:56.830 --> 05:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
sure we we'll ever get there um only
 
05:42:00.548 --> 05:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
because again
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's what's happening in everybody in
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
each party's households and then there's
 
05:42:05.468 --> 05:42:05.478 align:start position:0%
what they can prove what they can bring
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
what they can bring to the court um I
 
05:42:10.590 --> 05:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
know the courts the courts do
 
05:42:14.468 --> 05:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
try um I just I wish we
 
05:42:17.548 --> 05:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
had more guidance than
 
05:42:21.750 --> 05:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
this proposal gives us with regards to
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
um different levels of of deviation so
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
that people would know ahead of time
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
what the deviation should be and where
 
05:42:32.910 --> 05:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.548 --> 05:42:35.558 align:start position:0%
it would well I I think it should we
 
05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
should put it in if it was in the in the
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
law with much more like levels I mean it
 
05:42:42.830 --> 05:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
sort of starts here but the levels are
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
only in very very specific circumstances
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
if in other state statutes that I've
 
05:42:54.070 --> 05:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
seen become much more um different boxes
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
and everybody lands in a box as opposed
 
05:42:59.150 --> 05:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
to this which I think is you have very
 
05:43:02.190 --> 05:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
boxes for zero zero amount of child
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
support and then it gets mushy is the
 
05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
word that comes to mind and then it's
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
sort of like well it could be this well
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
it could be that I'm thinking of of
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who come in and want to you know
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
if I if I get divorced right now what's
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
my what's my child support going to
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
be it it's it to me it still feels very
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
unknown um based on unusual
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
circumstance no I'll leave it that thank
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
you attorney pres thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you counselor the chair next
 
05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
recognizes Rebecca Hutchins from uh
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
Dober and he will call her once uh
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:53.310 --> 05:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
recognized Mike
 
05:43:56.110 --> 05:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
on Mr rafon if you don't know him
 
05:43:58.270 --> 05:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
personally thank you as I as I recall in
 
05:44:01.548 --> 05:44:01.558 align:start position:0%
the review one of the issues um they had
 
05:44:04.670 --> 05:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire is the deviations the
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
number of deviations and and I I
 
05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
remember rather High uh percent you
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
probably remember better than I do um
 
05:44:14.430 --> 05:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
will this exacerbate that or will this
 
05:44:17.548 --> 05:44:17.558 align:start position:0%
improve that or leave it about the
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
say I think it it would lead to more
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
deviations because it actually CS for
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
deviations in in the law
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um whether that would eliminate other
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
deviations because of because of certain
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
things I don't know um but I think I
 
05:44:36.910 --> 05:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
think it might lead to at least a slight
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
now Rebecca
 
05:44:53.708 --> 05:44:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but not when she got her cell
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
5 it's
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
what Nashville I was just there rule one
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
here that we really work hard at is turn
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
the mic on you have passed rule one
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.708 --> 05:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
you uh chairman Pearson and members of
 
05:45:22.868 --> 05:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
CH uh children and family law committee
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Rebecca Hutchins I am in
 
05:45:27.390 --> 05:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
support of making changes to our
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
legislation to include recommendations
 
05:45:31.868 --> 05:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
from the quadrennial reviews of the New
 
05:45:34.510 --> 05:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child support guidelines as
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
you may have read my written testimony
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
last week in support of hb1
 
05:45:43.390 --> 05:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
1595 since first SE seeing the 2018 New
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child support guidelines
 
05:45:48.628 --> 05:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
review report I had naively expected
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the state would implement the
 
05:45:51.750 --> 05:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations to adopt a shared
 
05:45:51.760 --> 05:45:53.350 align:start position:0%
recommendations to adopt a shared
parenting

05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
05:45:56.350 --> 05:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
calculation I'm a mom of two and I have
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
had shared parenting uh since my divorce
 
05:45:58.958 --> 05:46:00.030 align:start position:0%
had shared parenting uh since my divorce
in

05:46:00.030 --> 05:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
2018 I've been working with
 
05:46:03.868 --> 05:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
Representatives Bickford and majori
 
05:46:05.590 --> 05:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
alongside the National Parents
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
organization and New Hampshire citizens
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
to bring 20 plus years of research to
 
05:46:12.910 --> 05:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
light and to finally include a parenting
 
05:46:14.990 --> 05:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
time adjustment in our
 
05:46:18.830 --> 05:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
legislation HB 1564 is a step in the
 
05:46:20.830 --> 05:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
right direction for the changes that
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
have been needed for so long I support
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
two specific aspects of this bill one
 
05:46:29.788 --> 05:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
increase the self-support reserve to
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
130% it's currently at 115% above the
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
National Poverty Level this was noted in
 
05:46:38.670 --> 05:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of the 2022
 
05:46:42.590 --> 05:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
quadrennial review as previously stated
 
05:46:44.910 --> 05:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh secondly the bill acknowledges the
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
need to consider parenting schedules as
 
05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
a factor in child support orders this
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
bill helps specific families as it
 
05:46:55.150 --> 05:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
speaks clearly and plainly to a range of
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
parents where a0 order would be
 
05:46:58.160 --> 05:46:59.230 align:start position:0%
parents where a0 order would be
appropriate

05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
in situations where parents share
 
05:47:03.468 --> 05:47:03.478 align:start position:0%
approximately the same amount of time
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
with their children and they earn a
 
05:47:04.920 --> 05:47:06.110 align:start position:0%
with their children and they earn a
similar

05:47:06.110 --> 05:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
amount while the bill opens the
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
conversation for adjustments and other
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
ranges of income and parenting time it
 
05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
does not update the calculator so that
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
families have the tools to easily
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
navigate the mathematics behind
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
understanding a fair amount of child
 
05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
support for shared
 
05:47:25.708 --> 05:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
parenting without these tools I
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
personally find these sections confusing
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
as do other parents that I've shared it
 
05:47:35.468 --> 05:47:35.478 align:start position:0%
with HB 1595 is a broader look at
 
05:47:37.708 --> 05:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
parenting time adjustments and
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
specifically responds to the federal
 
05:47:41.788 --> 05:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
government's call to action for states
 
05:47:44.750 --> 05:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
to provide a formulaic approach to child
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
support guidelines to Res reduce the
 
05:47:49.868 --> 05:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
exorbitant number of deviations from the
 
05:47:53.230 --> 05:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines hb1 1595 does this by
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
changing the child support calculator to
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
give the proper tools to our New
 
05:47:59.548 --> 05:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and to reach an
 
05:48:02.468 --> 05:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate uniform support order this
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
calculator is in line with the cross-
 
05:48:06.670 --> 05:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
calculation method used in 42 other
 
05:48:09.230 --> 05:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
States it also includes a fair method
 
05:48:11.110 --> 05:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
for sharing medical and child care
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
expenses as well as includes a parenting
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
time adjustment the calculation method
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
does not need definitions of income
 
05:48:20.948 --> 05:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
brackets or thresholds to avoid Cliff
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
effects in the
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
calculation these definitions can be
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
made into into divisive measures to get
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the way of co-parents working well
 
05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
together last week chairman Pearson
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that the two bills exist
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
and urged the groups to merge the bills
 
05:48:39.230 --> 05:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
or to find a way to help the committee
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
pass the changes needed the groups have
 
05:48:44.788 --> 05:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
met and decided it doesn't make sense to
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
combine the bills at this time both
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
bills have enough Merit to stand
 
05:48:53.830 --> 05:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
independently HB 1564 includes changes
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
that can help many families without
 
05:48:58.190 --> 05:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
changing the child support calculator
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
and the possibility for Swift action is
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
appealing since our state has a history
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
of not making the needed changes for
 
05:49:11.708 --> 05:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
many years HB 1595 can stand without uh
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
hb564 however it can also be offered as
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
a companion tool for HB
 
05:49:22.750 --> 05:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
1564 both the working groups of HB 1564
 
05:49:25.788 --> 05:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
and 1595 have been working hard to bring
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
important changes to the state each bill
 
05:49:29.948 --> 05:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
has has different approaches to bring
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
that change for these reasons I
 
05:49:34.510 --> 05:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked this committee to
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
move both bills forward to benefit New
 
05:49:42.468 --> 05:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:49:47.708 --> 05:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman uh do you
 
05:49:49.590 --> 05:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
want to share with us any of your
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
background or how you got into this um
 
05:49:55.948 --> 05:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
certainly so I am a mom of two and I've
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
been navigating the court for quite some
 
05:49:58.080 --> 05:49:59.070 align:start position:0%
been navigating the court for quite some
time

05:49:59.070 --> 05:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
um I included my testimony for 1595
 
05:50:04.468 --> 05:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
which goes into a little bit more
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
history but we've been back and forth
 
05:50:10.110 --> 05:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
through mediators and Court um and had
 
05:50:13.628 --> 05:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
our parenting uh our our Uso our uniform
 
05:50:16.270 --> 05:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
support order changed a minimum of six
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
times since 2018 that's a lot right
 
05:50:24.750 --> 05:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
normal circumstances job loss incomes
 
05:50:28.628 --> 05:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
change we need an autonomous way for for
 
05:50:31.628 --> 05:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
families to navigate this litigation and
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
mediation is extremely expensive for us
 
05:50:38.310 --> 05:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
to go back for small changes that happen
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
regularly to our families I have been in
 
05:50:44.548 --> 05:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
a situation currently where it's been a
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
year and a half of in and out of court
 
05:50:49.948 --> 05:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
to have an order changed it's been
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
changed twice temporarily and yet I
 
05:50:54.468 --> 05:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
still need to go back for a final
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
hearing this is ridiculous to navigate a
 
05:50:58.000 --> 05:50:59.788 align:start position:0%
hearing this is ridiculous to navigate a
normal

05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
normal
 
05:50:59.798 --> 05:51:01.390 align:start position:0%
normal
family

05:51:01.390 --> 05:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
situation that's the reason that I've
 
05:51:03.360 --> 05:51:05.628 align:start position:0%
situation that's the reason that I've
gotten

05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
05:51:10.390 --> 05:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
involved I uh look at the bottom uh last
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
sentence of your document I respectfully
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
ask this committee to move both bills
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
forward to benefit the Hampshire
 
05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
families but at the top of the page
 
05:51:23.110 --> 05:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
while the bill opens the conversation
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
for adjustments etc etc uh without these
 
05:51:28.750 --> 05:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
tools I personally find this SE
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
confusing as to other parents I've
 
05:51:34.670 --> 05:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
shared with so you like it but there are
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill that do the job for
 
05:51:41.150 --> 05:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
specific families for families that
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
currently don't have a law that says
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's okay to have zero support when we
 
05:51:49.030 --> 05:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
have similar parenting time and we have
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
similar uh incomes this bill does that
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
the current section for deviations in
 
05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
our law RSA 258 C5
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for families to deviate or
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
recognize that shared parenting alone is
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
a reason for our child support numbers
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
to be different than what our current
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
calculator spits
 
05:52:13.760 --> 05:52:16.070 align:start position:0%
calculator spits
out

05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
hb564 begins to pave the way for people
 
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
to do that okay so for those reasons I
 
05:52:26.310 --> 05:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate their attempt to change the
 
05:52:28.670 --> 05:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
law without changing the calculator
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
later so it's a good step forward you
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
wanted another step but you take the win
 
05:52:36.350 --> 05:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
I I will take the win and I think we
 
05:52:39.230 --> 05:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
still need to update the calculator okay
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions and in case I forget at the
 
05:52:45.548 --> 05:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
end of the hearing we will not be
 
05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
working to exec these bills for a couple
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
to three weeks and if things that have
 
05:52:54.510 --> 05:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
been shared in the hearings resonate
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
with uh definitely the prime sponsor or
 
05:52:59.070 --> 05:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
any of the other sponsors it gives us
 
05:53:01.948 --> 05:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to tweak and amend if we
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
choose so thank you for your testimony
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
apprciate appreciate it
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
and are you native to

you Long Island okay I thought I heard
 
05:53:24.990 --> 05:53:25.000 align:start position:0%

05:53:38.310 --> 05:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you for letting me give
 
05:53:41.520 --> 05:53:44.030 align:start position:0%
please thank you for letting me give
testimony

05:53:44.030 --> 05:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
um my opinion I'm I'm sharing my opinion
 
05:53:51.468 --> 05:53:51.478 align:start position:0%
from hearing for years that the child
 
05:53:55.150 --> 05:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
support collection part of the state of
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
DHHS is rewarded on a percent basis by
 
05:54:02.910 --> 05:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government for doing the
 
05:54:04.510 --> 05:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
service of
 
05:54:08.190 --> 05:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
collecting the more so what I understand
 
05:54:11.070 --> 05:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
is the more they collect the more
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
Federal money comes in well we all know
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
we want our budgets to be as healthy as
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
possible so I want to suggest that one
 
05:54:22.350 --> 05:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
of the reasons
 
05:54:25.868 --> 05:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
underpinning the a uh State not being
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
really thrilled with a just
 
05:54:32.868 --> 05:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
um changing the rules is because they
 
05:54:36.468 --> 05:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
might end up collecting less money
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
instead of two parents paying each other
 
05:54:42.830 --> 05:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
instead of subtracting one from the
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
other that can be a reason that they're
 
05:54:50.030 --> 05:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
not really happy to see some new rules
 
05:54:53.230 --> 05:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will cut down on how much
 
05:54:56.310 --> 05:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
people have to pay in so that it just
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
makes the the living conditions for the
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
child more equal from P both
 
05:55:03.718 --> 05:55:06.310 align:start position:0%
child more equal from P both
parents

05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:14.510 --> 05:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
point oh in addition to getting funding
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
from the federal government as a reward
 
05:55:21.628 --> 05:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
for collecting the parents have to pay a
 
05:55:23.948 --> 05:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
percentage for the service of having
 
05:55:26.590 --> 05:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
their money collected and
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
dispersed so I find this burdensome for
 
05:55:33.948 --> 05:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
the parents I both received child
 
05:55:37.310 --> 05:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
support and I paid child
 
05:55:40.030 --> 05:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
support um so many years were between
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
the two that I ended up paying as almost
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
as much for one as I receive for two but
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
that was not the issue the point is I
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't think the parents should have to
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
be paying for this service especially
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
after they're getting um re getting
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
rewarded by the federal government and
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
if they're not if they're going to
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
suffer Lo losing a lot of funds from the
 
05:56:06.990 --> 05:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
federal government by allowing people to
 
05:56:10.590 --> 05:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
pay less to stay as equal as
 
05:56:10.600 --> 05:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
pay less to stay as equal as
possible

05:56:12.390 --> 05:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:56:16.030 --> 05:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
um then they're going to be paying less
 
05:56:18.270 --> 05:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
I I just think that this is a very this
 
05:56:21.670 --> 05:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill is a very positive move to make
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
things more Equitable for the parents
 
05:56:28.830 --> 05:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
and lessen the need to go to court which
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
if you haven't gone to court
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
recently you don't realize just how
 
05:56:36.270 --> 05:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
devastating the costs are to your to
 
05:56:36.280 --> 05:56:37.788 align:start position:0%
devastating the costs are to your to
your

05:56:37.788 --> 05:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
income thank you any questions of The
 
05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
Honorable fetty
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
gay seeing none thank you so
 
05:56:50.110 --> 05:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
much and we're coming coming into the
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
gun lap and attorney J marel yes sir I
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
got it yes thank you and I'm going to
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
limit you to five minutes please because
 
05:57:01.830 --> 05:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
the weather outside isn't continues to
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
be bad and you're on board with the bill
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
so you have less negative to bring to it
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
that I didn't mean it that way you have
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
less other opinion to bring is what I
 
05:57:16.190 --> 05:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
meant so thank you sir okay thank you um
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
generally supportive um just a couple of
 
05:57:20.990 --> 05:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you may wish to
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
consider I'm looking at uh page two and
 
05:57:28.830 --> 05:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking from lines one down through
 
05:57:31.868 --> 05:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
14 just as a preface nothing in the
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
current law prevents anybody with
 
05:57:36.430 --> 05:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
substantially equal parenting time or
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
any other reason uh prevents the court
 
05:57:41.070 --> 05:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
from issuing two simultaneous uniform
 
05:57:43.270 --> 05:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
support orders for the parents one
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
parent can actually be ordered to pay
 
05:57:46.468 --> 05:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
one parent and another parent can be
 
05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay another parent which
 
05:57:50.030 --> 05:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
leads me to the believe because that's
 
05:57:52.990 --> 05:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
the whole in the current statute uh so
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
when I look at page two uh basically
 
05:57:58.670 --> 05:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
what you're dealing with here is is that
 
05:58:00.030 --> 05:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
you can deal with what's called the
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
child support offset which I mentioned
 
05:58:05.070 --> 05:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
last time which was basically in very
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
common use prior to uh the Silva
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
decision uh as I as I think you've
 
05:58:13.510 --> 05:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
already heard the Silva decision
 
05:58:16.350 --> 05:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
rendered basically an unfair what a
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
widely perceived unfair result where
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
parents with approximately equal
 
05:58:24.628 --> 05:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
parenting time uh with a disparity of
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
income which was never defined in the
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and never defined um in
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
Silva because the court couldn't add
 
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
words to the legisl to legislation so
 
05:58:36.190 --> 05:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
that was unfair so this seeks to remedy
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
that the remedy I think can be more
 
05:58:41.910 --> 05:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
concisely put from those pages right
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
there into using the offset formula to
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
be able to um to be able to represent
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the children when
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
you have a finding by a judge that it
 
05:58:53.548 --> 05:58:53.558 align:start position:0%
does comport with the that it comp that
 
05:58:55.310 --> 05:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
it does represent the best interest of
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
the children and is agreed to by the is
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
either ordered by the court or agreed to
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
by the parents that would be the
 
05:59:02.670 --> 05:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
amendment I would make it would probably
 
05:59:04.270 --> 05:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
make it a little easier for people to
 
05:59:04.280 --> 05:59:05.110 align:start position:0%
make it a little easier for people to
work

05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
with that okay ends my question so if
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:17.948 --> 05:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you sir thank you and
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:25.120 --> 05:59:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
tangu

05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
tangu
 
05:59:26.638 --> 05:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
tangu
right

05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:59:31.708 --> 05:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
thank you I say Let It Snow it's all
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
good um I am opposed to this bill
 
05:59:38.110 --> 05:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
actually respectfully because of um I
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
know the hard work that's been put into
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
it however um as I've stated before uh
 
05:59:48.190 --> 05:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
but not really in in directly into this
 
05:59:52.708 --> 05:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
bill um there's a statute on the books
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
from the uniform support Act of
 
05:59:56.558 --> 05:59:58.110 align:start position:0%
from the uniform support Act of
1955

05:59:58.110 --> 05:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
1955
 
05:59:58.120 --> 05:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
1955
uh

05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:02.788 --> 06:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
which states that basically assets shall
 
06:00:05.910 --> 06:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
be considered um as The Honorable Betty
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
Gil just uh uh gave I'm sorry it was
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
getting back into the 50s uh stated is
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the child
 
06:00:18.110 --> 06:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
support group gets their uh I mean the
 
06:00:20.110 --> 06:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
states get funding by the amount of
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
child support that they
 
06:00:21.760 --> 06:00:23.310 align:start position:0%
child support that they
award

06:00:23.310 --> 06:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
award
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
and therefore they want to award child
 
06:00:26.638 --> 06:00:28.708 align:start position:0%
and therefore they want to award child
support

06:00:28.708 --> 06:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that's just wrong I I don't think
 
06:00:34.510 --> 06:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
that child support is something that
 
06:00:34.520 --> 06:00:35.430 align:start position:0%
that child support is something that
should

06:00:35.430 --> 06:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:00:37.990 --> 06:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
awarded and then when you look at how
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
the laws actually applied we have
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
standing laws where it says assets shall
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
be considered the the relative
 
06:00:52.510 --> 06:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh wealth is the specific term of the
 
06:00:55.150 --> 06:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
individual families
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
um that's already there and that should
 
06:01:00.868 --> 06:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
be on the child guidelines worksheet and
 
06:01:03.310 --> 06:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's not so that's why I don't and I
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
also don't support a bill that
 
06:01:04.718 --> 06:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
also don't support a bill that
acknowledges

06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledges
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
173b domestic violence protection orders
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
civil because it's against the
 
06:01:14.110 --> 06:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 15 of the
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the State of New
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rights of the accused says
 
06:01:20.430 --> 06:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
that in order to take away any
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
privileges property anything you have to
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
go through due process meaning you need
 
06:01:28.990 --> 06:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
an arrest so that's saying part of this
 
06:01:32.190 --> 06:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
Bill is saying that this will apply
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
unless there's domestic violence by the
 
06:01:39.070 --> 06:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
way 173b is unconstitutional and it's
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
being used to
 
06:01:44.310 --> 06:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
strategically get and get the person
 
06:01:46.270 --> 06:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
who's claiming domestic
 
06:01:51.390 --> 06:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
violence uh money child support time
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
complete control of the
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
children uh verification of the record
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
and also like def
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
like they they put these things that are
 
06:02:01.868 --> 06:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
false um and it's also you know before
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
the special committee uh chair Pearson
 
06:02:06.510 --> 06:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
um we actually heard the famous judge
 
06:02:10.510 --> 06:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
poly case in which the police did not
 
06:02:12.350 --> 06:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
arrest the person who ended up shooting
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
her in the face and also the domestic
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition never showed up to
 
06:02:19.948 --> 06:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
the final protection order so the police
 
06:02:22.708 --> 06:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
failed to follow the law when there was
 
06:02:25.548 --> 06:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
signs of physical and sexual abuse there
 
06:02:27.628 --> 06:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
was evidence of and they said go file a
 
06:02:30.750 --> 06:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
civil protection order so we need to be
 
06:02:30.760 --> 06:02:31.910 align:start position:0%
civil protection order so we need to be
working

06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
on repealing
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
173b and enforcing the
 
06:02:42.868 --> 06:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
police to arrest people who violate the
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:49.590 --> 06:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledging laws that
 
06:02:53.310 --> 06:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
state that child support shall be shall
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
be considered by who uh the General
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
assets of of and wealth of the
 
06:03:03.548 --> 06:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
individual parties the ability to earn
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
and so on and then we also have to
 
06:03:08.468 --> 06:03:08.478 align:start position:0%
consider that in some cases child
 
06:03:12.510 --> 06:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
support is not necessary in any which
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
manner the CH what a parent spends their
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
money on for their children is a free
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
speech it's been acknowledged and
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
political contributions federally it's
 
06:03:27.948 --> 06:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
free speech if I want to buy my child
 
06:03:30.830 --> 06:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
a ring dding I can if I want to buy them
 
06:03:33.270 --> 06:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
a library book I can if I don't want
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
them to have a brand new
 
06:03:37.948 --> 06:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
iPad I shouldn't have to if I don't want
 
06:03:40.270 --> 06:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
to pay the mother's
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage because she wanted to end a
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
relationship you got
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
left okay so I don't support this Bill
 
06:03:51.548 --> 06:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
06:03:54.468 --> 06:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
um for those reasons stated and I just
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
want to really uh hammer in that once
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
73b is unconstitutional I'm challenging
 
06:04:04.310 --> 06:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
it with the attorney general and uh the
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
state and we shouldn't be using
 
06:04:10.948 --> 06:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
funding uh for federal money
 
06:04:13.390 --> 06:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
to basically
 
06:04:16.390 --> 06:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
Force payments through the state and
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually a Constitutional
 
06:04:19.070 --> 06:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I I was trying to look
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
up uh that says basically we can't the
 
06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
state can't uh take property away from
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone else for the use of of public
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
use which that's what child support is
 
06:04:32.910 --> 06:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'll contend but ums I
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
want you all to be safe and really look
 
06:04:35.200 --> 06:04:36.990 align:start position:0%
want you all to be safe and really look
at

06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
546 and really understand the the spirit
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
of Child Support was designed to get uh
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
