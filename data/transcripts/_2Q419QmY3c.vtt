Deo thank you madam
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
chair my concern
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
is the human rights commit
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think throwing money at it
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
is the total answer we have to do better
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
public the fact that it's taking several
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
years sometimes for a case to
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
finish somehow we need to speed it up I
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
right Lorenzo thank you madam chair I
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
would like to go back to the original um
 
00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.029 align:start position:0%
would like to go back to the original um
bill

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the original bill was a Senate Bill
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about the SB 216 yes
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
sb216 and the original bill was
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
the complainant only to remove the case
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.469 align:start position:0%
 
Court

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay so you're T okay so are you talking
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
about the initial bill that um you and
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
rep Smith and rep yes it was 362 362
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't know if you were referring
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
to the Senate bill from the year before
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
when you said SB so that's why I was oh
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay I got confused okay okay um and did
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on it or you're
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
just saying that that's the that's what
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
you would prefer to move forward with um
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
I think I I wanted to just mention that
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
that was the original intent of the bill
 
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
um and since then we found other other
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
issues with um Human Rights Commission
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
and we do have a
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
um a performance audit in that's being
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
done now and I was wondering if we
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
should wait until the performance audit
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
is completed before we make any
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
decisions thank so uh just to give a
 
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
little information I did contact the LBA
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
audit division yesterday just to get us
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
stus and see when we may get that they
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
informed me that they would they
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to complete the audit
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
until about mid-February plus or minus a
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
month and so this bill we would have to
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
act on by November
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
17th however rep Smith let me know that
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
when the LBA audit is completed it will
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
go to the finance committee and at that
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
point the and correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
please the finance committee could go
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
before the rules committee to put in
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
necessary uh thank you for um
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
recognizing me I'm not on the
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee although of course I am on
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
on the full committee um the uh the LBA
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
reports to the fiscal committee that's
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
where they report and um they have been
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
asked asked to do a performance audit
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
not a financial audit performance audit
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
they will submit that
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
report to the fiscal committee once the
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee accepts it which they
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
will do immediately upon
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
receip then it is in the possession of
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the house and at that point it would be
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
anybody but it would be appropriately
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
this committee the house judiciary
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee that could go to the rules
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
committee and if they so chose and to
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
say information has come to us that was
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
not available during the um the regular
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
period for filing bills and um it came
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a result of the performance audit and
 
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
we have two choices I mean the first is
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
to say we think that there are steps
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
that could be and should be taken
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
immediately in in order to best meet the
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
needs of the citizens of the state and
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
therefore we would like permission for a
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
bill um and we would I mean if we could
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
get it and act on it by the end of March
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
we don't even have to suspend rules on
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house um the other
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
alternative is we say to this committee
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
um we now have the results of the
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
performance audit that the previous
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee asked
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
for we know this has been going on a
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
long time but the problems have been
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
longer and um we would like to have an
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
informal group from the Judiciary
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
Committee and I would hope from the
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
public um uh you know the there are a
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
number of different components in the
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
public who have vested interest in this
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
to shape a
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
bill that we could then file for the
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
next term so we have
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
two alternative approaches that way and
 
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.189 align:start position:0%
two alternative approaches that way and
I

00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
um I of course would support the major
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
what the majority of the subcommittee
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the committee would like to do um I
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
have a vote I guess only on the full
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee but my vote there would be to
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
say rather than uh put a Band-Aid on um
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
a little little scratch that we
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
see um that we ought to wait and see
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
what the performance audit says I
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
believe the performance audit will end
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
up identifying a
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
series of of places that we could help
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
make the human uh Rights Commission
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
better meet its obligations and that's
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
our role um so I I don't I don't
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
particularly see going to all the effort
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
to to address one
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
small I don't mean
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
insignificant but small problem
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
in light of the major
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
concerns thank
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
you rep Manos and then rep Morgan thank
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
you I I see value in doing that and
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for the for the um the audit to
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
come back I am concerned about what
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
happens to complainants in the meantime
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
and leaving the issue unaddressed but I
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
think there are enough issues that we
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
can wait for the audit and address
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
everything at
 
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.910 align:start position:0%
everything at
once

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's my
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
preference to do that to approach it
 
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.710 align:start position:0%
preference to do that to approach it
that

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
way again um yes I uh also agree that we
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
should wait for the audits I don't think
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
there's much legislative we can do uh
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
you know this fall fall about it I um
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
because the original impetus behind the
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
bill was just right now either the
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
complaintant or the respondent can
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
appeal to the superior court and um it's
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
not really a huge we did get a memo with
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
a number of cases it's not a huge number
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
of cases so like it's um not going to
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
affect the court system that much one
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
way or another if we add or subtract
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
those cases to their their workload but
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and the reason and also I I found the
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh file the pill file which is online
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
from the uh way back in 2000 which
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
before I was in the legislature there
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
were a couple familiar names involved in
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
it like uh Senator uh dad Gordon who was
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
our chair until uh last last year till
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
last session was involved in it and
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
Sandy resent Sandy ke who was also a
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
longtime member of the committee until
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
about three or four years ago so it's uh
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
um this has been the impetus behind uh
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
the original bill I think just said just
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the complainant uh could appeal the
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
courts which is how it is with most such
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings and that was the purpose of
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
bill to make it that way and but the
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
very original Bill submitted way back in
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
2000 said that and then they added the
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
respondent basically as part of uh to
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
get a compromise to get something that
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
could go through both houses both
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislative Chambers and it passed
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
apparently fairly easy judging by the
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
docket so um even though I think in
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
theory the original version of this bill
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
is an improvement um I think it's
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
probably tolerable the way it is and
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
this uh particular institution
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
Commission on human rights it's not
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
functioning perfectly but it's
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
functioning better than a lot of
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent agencies elsewhere in state
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
government so I think we may have
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
stumbled on something that's you know
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
endemic to many many boards and
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
commissions throughout the state
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
government and nothing unique to this um
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
organization which uh could be
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
functioning better but it seems to be
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
functioning uh reasonably well under the
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
under the with the resources available
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
to and and all things so I think so I'm
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
not sure if we need any amendments or
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislation right now but we do need to
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on the performance audit and
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
possibly introduce legislation if we can
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
based on that and
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
that that's probably correct Their
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
forance audience won't be there until
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
the spring of 2024 sometime so that's
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from on
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
that thank you
roran

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
um yes rep mad chair may I ask a
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
question sure I think I'm having a
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
senior moment so please bear with me is
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
it this
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill or is it another where we had hoped
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
that some of the attorneys involved in
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
each traditional
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
side uh we going to get together to see
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
if they could come up
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
with a suggestion for how to move
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
forward and and I'm now confused as to
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
whether it was this bill or another can
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
you help me it was this bill and I know
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
that attorney Burns reached out to
 
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.070 align:start position:0%
that attorney Burns reached out to
attorney

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
daragon um and
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
I correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
attorney daragon said we don't really
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
want to compromise right now we want to
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
wait for the LBA audit to be completed
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
statement there's a red light is that on
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much just to clarify
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
it is true that attorney Heather Burns
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
one of my my um esteemed colleagues she
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
contacted me to see for that very
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
purpose and it was
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
considered um that this audit still has
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
to come to full
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
fruition and my response to her was just
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
that let's see how the audit plays out
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
let's get that information that data and
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
then take it from there
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so sorry
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
um could you please identify yourself oh
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Beth Daran I'm an
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
employment lawyer and I'm employed at
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
past story crayons here in conquered New
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you so I did want to
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
point out just to the to thank you I
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it to the committee to the
 
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.909 align:start position:0%
appreciate it to the committee to the
subcommittee

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
that last year there was a subcommittee
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
who kind of deep dived into this and as
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
a result of that
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there was a decision and a
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
to move forward with the LBA audit
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
however there was also a decision to
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
move forward with this bill and it
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't thought that this bill was going
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
to correct the
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
over the overall issue it was taking one
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
slice of a piece that
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
was considered unjust or
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
unfair and bringing that piece forward
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
and then letting the LBA audit play out
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
concurrently so this was never meant to
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
solve the bigger picture and I just I
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're considering
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
that piece of it because I think they're
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
two separate issues this was never this
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
for my understanding this bill wasn't
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
put forward to solve the overarching
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
issue and I do want to note that like
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
rep Horgan I did pull up the meeting
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
minutes or the committee minutes from
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
2000 when this was put in and even back
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
in 2000 and there was a big issue with a
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
backlog of cases and there was cases
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
that attorneys had testified were four
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
to 5 years old so this is not a new
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue and I would say that obviously
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't start just in in 2000 so
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
this issue's been going on for more than
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
25 years and I'm not sure exactly how
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
long it's been going on but at least 25
 
00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
long it's been going on but at least 25
years

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that it's something that
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
to fix overnight but I I would
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
say you know that I when we went in June
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
information we were informed you know at
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
that time that the oldest open case had
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
been that of
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
2020 is that correct
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
2022 um and then when we came back here
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
fall we were informed well that just
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
meant the oldest case that was awaiting
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
to be insigned to an investigator but
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
not the oldest pending case and so I
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
think this committee had
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
was at least I will say that I felt a
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
little bit misled because I I went into
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
the summer thinking okay maybe that's
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
not the pro maybe it's not a problem
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
anymore maybe things are fixed and then
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
come to find out they weren't fixed and
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
so at this point it's
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to kind of go back in time and
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
be like how can we try and fix that
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
think I mean does anybody feel
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
that this sliver of a piece should be
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
fixed at all before we move forward with
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
the overall fixing that needs to be done
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
with the LBA audit or does everybody
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
feel we shouldn't try and fix any piece
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
it um I believe that representative Lynn
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
has an amendment is that correct and
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
would it my question would be um can
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that Amendment be proposed to the
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or do we have to wait for
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
the um for the whole committee to meet
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
to consider that Amendment so we could
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
look at it um um however I did I did
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
speak uh with some of the employee
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys and they actually felt like
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
that Amendment would make things worse
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
they'd prefer just it Ling it and the
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
reason why is because for a pray party
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
to have their case pulled before the
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
investigation is complete they'd be on
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
the hook financially to pay for some
 
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a private investigation because
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
at that point if you're pulling out
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
after 60 days or I mean after um six
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
months plus or minus that or plus that
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
TW month period you're talking eight
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
months at that point the investigation
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
completed so
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that that being said does anybody
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
table

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
entertaining so um if we want to OTP it
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
if we want to OTP with some sort of
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
amendment or if we want to itl it I
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
think would be the proper motions before
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
us I would say itl does anybody second
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:32.830 align:start position:0%
us I would say itl does anybody second
that

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
second I I'll second it if no one else
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess then do we want
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
to vote on that all in favor if you want
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand if you're in favor of
 
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand if you're in favor of
it

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
Ling are you
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
opposed are you opposed to Elling okay
 
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
opposed are you opposed to Elling okay
all

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.789 align:start position:0%
all
right

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
um three to two
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so I we bring forward this
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the main committee I
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
say you know that one of the big
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
principles that we've
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
always discussed as a committee is just
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
as delayed as just as denied and I I
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
really strongly
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
feel that what's happening right now is
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
not good and not just for for the
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire we need to do
 
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.950 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire we need to do
better

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
waiting for years to get Justice is just
 
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.750 align:start position:0%
waiting for years to get Justice is just
completely

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
unacceptable I understand that there
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
were reasons why and that this has been
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
when we went there were five
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
investigators at the time one has now
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
one uh is no longer there now and so and
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
there were four four new investigator
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
positions that were put into the budget
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
so there's now five investigator
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
positions and those haven't even been
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
posted yet so we've got to move forward
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
with something and I I hope that this
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee will not have to micromanage
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
these things but we're certainly
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
prepared to do so if we have to it's I
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
think it's very important that those
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
requisitions are are posted at once and
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
that we really work and move forward to
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
getting caught up on the backlog of
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
cases because it just it's unacceptable
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of New Hampshire and we
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't let things continue on this way
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have anything they'd
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
say rep Anderson then rep
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
deeno thank you madam chair the reason I
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
oppose this is is because I feel that if
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill it's a small step
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
forward and I agree with you we need to
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
do something for the people of New
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I totally agree that as far
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
as the performance audit and that end of
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
it we have to
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
wait but we can't keep my thing is we
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
can't keep kicking the ball down the
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
road and not going forward and making
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
things better for the people of New
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have legitimate claims
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
and you know I just think we have to do
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
better and I hope no matter what that
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
this Human Rights Commission what's the
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
problems aren't dropped and put on a
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
back burner somewhere
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
because I
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
think it's a the commission is a
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
challenge and we need to get it
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
lzo Rett
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
Manos the reason that I voted um itl is
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
because I think the um the the bill
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
creates a due process argument which I
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
think is a serious concern and that if
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
you take away um if you give only the
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
complainant the right to remove I think
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
you create a due process argument um so
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's why I voted to itl but I also
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I completely agree
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
with you rep katab on the issue about
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission having new
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
resources now to hire additional
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
investigators additional staff and
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
frankly I find it very very very
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerning that the commission hasn't
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
moved forward with um posting those
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
openings and engaging in the process of
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
hiring new people new staff so um I want
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
to urge also that the that that that
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
process be engaged and and be followed
 
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:19.310 align:start position:0%
process be engaged and and be followed
through

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
on mam sh would we be able to would we
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
be able to um speak with a witness right
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
now um the executive director an
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
Malachi sure sure um
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
if director Malachi would you be willing
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
to come up I think do did you have a
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
yes good morning good morning Miss
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
Malachi it's great to see you again my
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
my question is around the relationship
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
between the Human Rights Commission and
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and I see
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office as the
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights division how closely do
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
does the commission for human rights and
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
work um there are opportunities for us
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
to work closely together uh the Civil
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
Rights unit specifically at the doj has
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
um jurisdiction over 354a which is the
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission stat
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
as well as 354b which deals with hate
 
00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:31.870 align:start position:0%
as well as 354b which deals with hate
crimes

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
so we we don't necessarily work together
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
on a particular case uh but we can work
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
together if need be okay so followup so
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
does the um civil rights division have
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
um do they
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
have do they supervise the Human Rights
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
Commission they do not we are a separate
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
entity and there's one attorney in the
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights unit okay and then may I
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
ask another question yes you may so now
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
your office is moving correct correct
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
where are they moving to um the GNC just
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
approved our lease yesterday so we are
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
moving to 57 Regional Drive which is
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
around the corner from where we are and
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
it has uh almost triple the space that
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
we have right now oh terrific do you
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
find the space that you work in adequate
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
to the for the job that you need to do
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's inadequate for the number of people
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we will have okay so there's no
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
there are no other offices no space MH
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
so now geographically how close is your
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
office to the Attorney General's office
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not exactly sure how many miles
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
away so right now we're we're on two
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
Industrial Drive um and then we're
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
moving around the corner to Regional but
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
the doj is moving further away and
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're moving to one Granite place I
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
believe I think next week is when
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
they're moving actually um so I'm I'm
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure maybe it's a 10-minute
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
drive a give or take
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know I guess what I'm getting at
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
is I think it would be it would be great
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
if you all worked within the same
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
complex it would have been great that
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
was uh something the governor thought
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
about having us at Granite place but it
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
didn't work out so I had to make other
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
arrangements thank you when is that
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
lease set to start at the no it's set to
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
start November 1st uh but it will be a
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
little bit longer than that before we're
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
in there uh doit is working on cabling
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
right now um because the lease has been
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
sign the landlord can do carpet and all
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
those things and then that gives me an
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um to move forward with
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
some of the things that I was waiting on
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
because we'll have a place for everyone
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
to be we'll have computers yada yada so
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
do you think that in the meantime that
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to when are you or when do
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
you anticipate posting the job recks for
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
the new investigators as soon as
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
possible okay so as as in now not not as
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
soon as possible after the November 1
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
lease signing soon the leases the lease
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
is approved so we're definitely going
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
there everything is set um the doj is
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
moving next week so I'd have to
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
coordinate um they assist us with the
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
back of house things so job postings
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable accounts um payable
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
Etc so I just need to manage what that
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
looks like in terms of having things
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
posted uh but I mean that's not a a huge
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
hill to climb so okay perfect I did see
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
that they did post some new Rex this
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
week so it seems as if they are still
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
posting Rex maybe here and there
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
yeah poran oh you're we Vis I think most
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
of us around the many of us around the
 
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
table visited your office and you were
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
doing a good job in there but it was a
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
rather snug fit so like I'm so I'm glad
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
to hear that you'll have more space to
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
spread out it and move around in so
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
thanks so I have another question from
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
Miss Malachi do you feel that the
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
software that you that you're using now
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
is adequate for the job that you're
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.470 align:start position:0%
is adequate for the job that you're
doing

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question so um reports
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
are written in word so you know that's
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
not really cumbersome um what we are
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
working on or what I'm working on um
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
simultaneously is um a contract with a
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
vendor to establish a case management
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
system so right now what we have is a
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
series of word uh word and um Excel
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
documents to to do our tracking um we do
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
have a a case management system that we
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
use right now with through the EEOC
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
which belongs to them so it's the
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
federal governments they make it
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
available to all of the states that have
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
contracts with them so that's awesome
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
however um there's some reporting tools
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
that we don't have access to so that's a
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
whole another long story um and so
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
having our own case management system
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
although yes it would duplicate efforts
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
but it will allow us to have um all of
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
the statistical information that we need
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
it would allow us to have all of the
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
historical data that we have compiled
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
over time and allow us to move away from
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and have something that is
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
21st century yes uh thank you um for
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
your answer um can I just follow up um
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
do you go to like Regional or state um
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
conferences on for human rights
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
commissions like your like your own um
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
is there a trade group
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so um there are two answers to that
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
question so the EEOC annually does have
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
a National Conference which um all the
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
states participate and I have
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
participated every year uh since I
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
started which was in 2018 and during
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
coid those were virtual so we you know
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
participated virtually and then I don't
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
know if all the regions have a Regional
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
Conference excuse me but the New England
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
region which is region one we do have a
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
Regional Conference and I've
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
participated in those since 2018 as well
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
we just had um the last one was in uh
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
Saratoga Springs New York and it was
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
towards the end of
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
September so is there any type of canned
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
software from vendors that you could use
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
that other um agencies are using human
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
rights agencies are using um no because
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
everyone's using something different so
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts the their commission um
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
they've estab they've built their own
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
software which is maybe 20 or so years
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
old um some entities use Salesforce some
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
use Civ crrm uh Maine uses that one
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
which that's who I'm engaging with uh to
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
to have um it's an open source software
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
more information than you want to know
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
but to the short answer is everyone does
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
something a little different there isn't
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
just one thing other than the software
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
that the EEOC provides and we have to
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
use that in order for them to track our
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
case process processing um for payment
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
but they also allow us because most
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
states don't have the money to have a
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
separate case management system so they
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
do allow us to put all of our
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
information in there the caveat to that
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
is if they change systems which they did
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
in 20122 we run the risk of losing
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
historical data um but you know that
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
kind of Is What It Is Well you certainly
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
have some challenges thank you so much
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
for your responses one one final uh
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
thing so when the
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
or I guess while the LBA audit is still
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
being complete would you completed would
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
you be willing to try and come up with
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
some recommendations or ways that we may
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
be able to help this
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee expedite the cases you know so
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't have cases from from 2019
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
I mean it in my mind you know the having
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
Speedy Justice would mean definitely
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
less than a year from from start to
 
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.309 align:start position:0%
less than a year from from start to
completion

00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
completion
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and so could you try and come up with
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
some ways that you think that we may be
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
able to get to that point um so thank
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
you for that question um and to speak
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about the 2019 that's one
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
case and that's one of the ones that was
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
on the list um because of a bankruptcy
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
so we have to stay our work because of
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
the bankruptcy court and that's what
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
they're saying we have to do um so back
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
to answering your question um I'd be
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
happy to do that but what I would prer
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
if I could um I think it would be
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
more meaningful to have a one-on-one
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
conversation whether it's one of you or
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of you to walk through because
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
that I see from this side of the of the
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
table is there's a a a multitude of
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
information that you all have received
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
over the past three years there's a lot
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
of it um however there are things that
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
have been stated that are very dis
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
ingenuous and so yes this case may have
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
taken this long or that long but the
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys are not telling you that they
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
went on vacation for a month and we had
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
to wait or that they um after a
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
summation letter was sent then they
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
decided to amend a charge which then the
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
other side has to answer to so that
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
extends the time that it takes to
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
complete an investigation additionally
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
um the attorneys that practice before us
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
which are many and you've seen that on
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
the last email that I sent you these are
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
practice attorneys and if they have an
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
idea that it may take a little while for
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
us to get to them there's absolutely no
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
reason why they don't have affidavits
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
and other things that they would do in a
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
regular court case to put information to
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
give us the information to preserve
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they feel is
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
important for their client regardless of
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a complainant or a
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
respondent and those things are options
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
that they have all the time they've
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
always had those options and you know
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer but I can use a few
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
terms you know there's some attorneys
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
who will do motion practice in front of
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
us this one has a motion then you have
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
to wait for the other side then this one
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
makes a motion and you have to wait for
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
the other side and then this one wants
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
to make an amendment and then you have
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
to wait for the other side so those are
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
elements that are part of this that it's
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
not a plus or 1+ 1al 2 sometimes it's
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
1.1 + 2 = 3.5 so I think making the
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
rule because we should live in the rules
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
and not live in the exception however I
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
believe that having a more detailed
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
conversation where it's not a 30-minute
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
meeting so that there's a a bigger
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it is that we do
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense to bring some ideas
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
forward and have that conversation which
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm extremely open to doing and want to
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
do that um and that could be done
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow right we don't have to wait for
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
the LBA audit to finish um to have those
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
conversations and then we can make those
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
changes we can delay the changes until
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
the audit is done or get started on
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
whatever you all think is a great idea
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can also still make changes
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
complete um I'm gonna take rep Smith in
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
a second I just I would be very open to
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
doing that I think as long as we don't
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
have a quorum of people not meeting
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
however I think we need
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
to we would need to see what specific
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
things are kind of rules ver statues but
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
um go ahead rep Smith
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
for your candid approach um I want to
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
begin before I address what you've just
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
said I want to go back to um something
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative Andrew said
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
early on and I think she's absolutely
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
no rest of us voted well I didn't vote
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
but you you voted yes and yet her reason
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
for voting no is absolutely legitimate
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
she sees the legislator's
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do everything in our
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
power to make the Human Rights
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
Commission best meet the needs of the
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and sooner rather
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
than later is what we all should be
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
doing so I agree with her premise
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
completely where I disagree is that I
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
think we have been at this for a long
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
time I say this having been in the
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislature since 1996 I know what a
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
long time is and um we haven't been able
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
to get it right yet and I fear that if
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation that addresses one
 
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.910 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation that addresses one
very

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
small issue in a very long list of
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
serious problems
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
we conceivably make it possible for
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
people to say well you already did
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
something so let's go on to other issues
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
and I think we cannot put this off any
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
longer we have to address this in a way
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
that is complete I think that is why um
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
under uh the previous subcommittee's
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh chairmanship representive
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
McLean's chairmanship he moved to ask
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
the one
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
agency that's
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
available to the legislature to do the
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
best possible job he went to ask the
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
legislative audit committee to not just
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know look at a little bit here at a
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
little bit there but do a performance
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
audit of the
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
agency and we need to see how all the
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
pieces fit together it's not like each
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
of us takes a different position on the
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
elephant and says oh look this is all
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
about a tail or this is all about a
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
trunk this is about the entire human
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
relations commission that has
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
not been able for whatever
 
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.309 align:start position:0%
not been able for whatever
reason

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
to to operate I think at the standard
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
that all of us would like to see whether
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's a lack of resources a lack of Staff
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
a lack of money a lack of of rules
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
um with the suggestion that we have one
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
onone or non- quarm meetings we have a
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
right to no law and this legislative
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
body tries to follow the right to no no
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
we are not in what I would call the
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
blame game I don't care to blame anybody
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
that's not how we solve problems I don't
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
need a discussion of a list of this
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
person did this or that person did that
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
or this is the exception what I need is
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
a fully functioning agency that is
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
designed to best meet the needs of the
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
citizens and we as a
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislature do do not
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
administer the commission our job is to
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
set the
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
laws that then become the basis for how
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
the commission functions and they have
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
their regulations and they have whatever
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
else we are the policy committee we are
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
not the the people who should be
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning who should say well you know
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe this person should do this instead
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
basic structure upon which we have made
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
it possible for the commission to do
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to be doing and if
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
we don't don't do that we are not doing
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
our job and um and and the time has long
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
since P when we have to
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge longstanding
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
difficulties and um and this not fight
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
out who struck
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
John um either in private or in public
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
but instead take major steps to solve
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the problems because to solve well to
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
potentially solve one
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
problem in the midst of of a morass of
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
problems I
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
think does not help us get we're both
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative and Andrew and I and I
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
think all of you want to be I hope I
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
didn't talk too long no thank you for
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
your comments I appreciate it when I was
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh saying when
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
I agreed that hearing some suggestions
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea what I meant was
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
let legislative suggestions not one-off
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
suggestions what I meant was if there
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
was a deadline that we needed to put
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
into place that you know uh parties have
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
until XYZ date in order to file or give
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
XYZ so that they were more they weren't
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
going to be able to be waiting a year as
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
she just was discussing to give
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
something that was what I was referring
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
to not talking about specific instances
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
of specific things but a general picture
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
if there's something legislatively that
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
needed to be
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
fix it maybe would move something along
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I do acknowledge that I'm showing my
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
Prejudice and I do have Prejudice we all
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
do uh particular Prejudice that I want
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge is that I put a lot of
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
faith in the Integrity the
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
thoroughness the
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
honesty of the um of the LBA of both the
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
budget Division and the audit division
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
that comes from years of working closely
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
with them we as a legislature are very
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
lucky to have these incredible people
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
willing to do very hard work and
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes under unpleasant situations
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
where they have to
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
um pursue
 
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.510 align:start position:0%
um pursue
answers

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
where people don't want to give them
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
people might not want to give the
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
answers and um and I and I understand
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
that but all of that is why I think
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be in the way of having
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
them do the most complete analysis
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
possible and then have us be able to say
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriate role for the
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to play I guess I'm an
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned person I happen to know
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
they three branches of government a lot
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
of people don't even know that they're
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
three branches of government um I happen
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
to know that um that there is an
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
executive branch that's
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
separate um and and I think we each have
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
our obligations perfect um and so I
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
haven't to be fair I haven't seen an LBA
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
report so can I ask do they typically
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
give recommendations on how to rectify
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
the situation or they do they just
 
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
report things that they saw okay I am
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
disappointed to hear that you who I
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
believe know everything there is to know
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
and Who as a freshman know more and have
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
done more than people who have been here
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
forever and ever like me if you haven't
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
seen an LBA report you are missing
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
something that a performance audit a
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
financial order is what you might expect
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
a performance audit is very different
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
online and you know LBA you go to the
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
audit division pick a topic that you're
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
interested in and go read it they will
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
give you a history how did the how did
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
the agency get formed for what purpose
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of the audit
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just for something small
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's more um inclusive as this
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
one is and then they go through what
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
they've observed they go through where
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
they see that what they observe differs
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
from what they would have expected
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
either because of the law or the rules
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and they go through what um the
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions for adjusting and they also
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't just drop that on the agency
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
because one of the most important parts
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
is the agency gets to respond to each of
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
those points to say well we didn't see
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
it this way or well we see that you're
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
right and we're going to try to do
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
something or um you know whatever they
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
can answer in any way they want but they
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
are not blindsided in any way and then
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
there is a checklist and one of the
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
things that's interesting to see is when
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
an agency has been um uh audited over a
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
period of time to see what they were
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
asked to do when they were audited it in
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
1996 U was that before you were born no
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
not quite um and um and H have they
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
accomplished that you know have they
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished it in part I mean this is
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
not just saying ah this is a a very
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
thorough and just for the fun of it
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair you should go online and
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
pick anyone anyone at all I mean I'm not
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to say oh pick this one because
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's really good I'll definitely go look
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
I had only seen the financial ones I
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen so I didn't know that there
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
was two entirely different entirely
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
different people doing it and um highly
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
competent and um I mean if if you know
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone in the room who would
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with that
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
evaluation speak up um don't don't hold
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
back um so that is why uh
 
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair mlan and why
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo and I and put
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
so much faith in and because we can't do
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
it we don't have the skills and um nor
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
should we because that is not our
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
role and um that's my speech thank you I
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so it sounds like they'll
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
probably be presenting some suggestions
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
and you'll have time to respond back and
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
then afterwards I guess we'll as a as a
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee kind of look through those and
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
see if there might be anything we want
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
to move forward with and then definitely
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
um I know when I draft a bill I do talk
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
to the stakeholders involved with the
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
bill to make sure that I'm not missing
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
something so if if it was me I would
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
definitely be in touch if it's somebody
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
else they they'll likely do the same so
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
sure yes thank you madam chair I have
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
one question
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
who in this whole thing with the Human
