stretching from Bedford all the way to

Hinsdale uh clean water is an issue
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly important to me and
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
I've made it a priority to expand access
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
to clean water for families in my
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
and as I've start as we started testing
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
for these hazardous forever chemicals we
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
were finding that thousands of Granite
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%

Hampshire that citizens in New Hampshire
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
rely on while we've dedicated millions
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
of dollars to connecting these families
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
to Reliable supplies of clean water it's
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
been difficult to hold polluters
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for the cleanup efforts
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 4113 would create strict
 
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
liability for the contaminant cleanup
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
restoration or other remediation related
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%

accordance with applicable law and
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
departmental rules and authorize the
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to Institute a civil
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
action so that we can recover the cost
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
from the people for the that is for the
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
people that are responsible for the
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
pollution Senate Bill fourth 13 would
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
also hold the individuals running pfest
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
facilities personally responsible for
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
clearing up pest contamination I do want
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
to thank the Department of Environmental
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
Services and the Attorney General's
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
office for helping craft this very
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
important legislation it holds the
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
polluters accountable and gets resources
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
we need to clean up pest in New
 
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now just to elaborate on that
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
this bill was a heavy lift and we went
 
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
through rigorous amend amendments making
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we are holding the true big
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
company responsible we know that there's
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
pest in everything we know there's pfest
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
at the hospital the way this bill is
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
structured it it doesn't include those
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
levels this is for the most stringent
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
polluter say like for instance St gobain
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
so um in collaborating with uh all the
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the Business Institute
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
and industry Bia um they actually were
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
opposed until it was amended properly to
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
protect some of the small businesses
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is not about going after somebody
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
who unknowingly has the pest or the tiny
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant or the hospital either
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere this is about like the
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
situation that happened with st gobain
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
where um when the state made the decree
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
unknowingly they didn't realize it would
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
only be on like this side of 101 where
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
that part of marac and that part of
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
Bedford but now we know it's not just
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
run through the ground it's airborne and
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
now we have all this other contamination
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
so that all being said um everyone has
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh been in favor of this bill um and all
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
objections have been met so I really
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
hope that you can consider passing this
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can help the people in
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
the granite state and I'd be happy to
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%

um the recent uh decisions that have
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
been made at the federal government
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
about uh addressing pest well that
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
decision came out after this bill had
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
passed the full body of the Senate so we
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
would still need need this bill because
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
we still are in a predicament um with
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
the we have like two main big polluters
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and they're not being
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
is Mike whims I serve as director of the
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
Services uh pleased to have the
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be before you to testify
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
in support of House of Senate Bill 413
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
so as as sponsor Senator rardy has
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that this the primary uh
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
effect of this bill is to establish a
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
private right of action for persons
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
whose drinking water well has been
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by uh releases from a p by
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
pasas contamination from a pasas
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
facility uh the secondary things that it
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bill does is to clarify some of the
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
liability provisions of RSA 147b uh
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
relative to persons who cause a release
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
of either hazardous material or a
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste um and again we do
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
support this bill as amended by the by
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
the by the Senate um so to provide a
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
little detail on that um section seven
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose here if the owner
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
operator of a past facility contaminates
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
water groundwater anywhere um or surface
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
water anywhere at great at a
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
concentration greater than 10,000 parts
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
per trillion um of a regulated compound
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
and we currently regulate uh four
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
different compounds um then the
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
liability then that party is liable
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
under this bill to provide safe clean
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
water to the impacted property owner and
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
that can take the form if they're lucky
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
enough to be located within a reasonable
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
distance from a water line it can be in
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
the form of connecting to a public water
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
system and with a waterline connection
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
or failing that to Prov provide them
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
with a point of entry treatment system
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
and and and and to then provide for the
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing operation and maintenance of
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
that system um so that's the primary
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
focus I think what really Senator was
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this bill um some of
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
the secondary things that happen here so
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
in section five that affirms that the
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
owner or operator of past facilities who
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
cause contamination greater than 10,000
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion are subject to the
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
liability provisions of RSA 147b the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
hazard was clean of fund Act and then
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
section three clarifies that any person
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for release of any
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
hazardous material or hazardous waste um
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
is liable not just for costs but also to
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
conduct the containment the cleanup the
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
remediation and restoration that are
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
needed to address that
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
contamination and then section four of
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the bill clarifies the Attorney
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
General's Authority uh to not only
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
recover costs but also to compel those
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
responses um and clean up so these
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
Provisions um State also that the
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
authority applies to any person um it
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
just makes some CL really what amount to
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
clarifications of the existing law in
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 147b and with that um that that's my
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll be happy to take any
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
questions question uh representative
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um are are you
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that all Public Water
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
Systems in the state
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
um meet necessary standards in terms of
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
PS cont the lack of P contamination uh
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
no no I'm not I'm not saying that at all
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
there are um there are many public water
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
systems that um have already been found
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
to be over the standards that we
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
currently enforce for both for we have
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
state drinking water maximum contaminate
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
levels um the the one that most people
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
are familiar with is pfoa which has been
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
the primary contamin in Southern New
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um there were a number of
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
water systems that were impacted by that
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
and in other places and those systems
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
have had to put on carbon treatment to
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
treat those that water so that it meets
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
the standard um to get to a question you
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
asked the senator about this recent
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
announcement EPA has recently announced
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
that they will now regulate um among
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
other contaminants pfoa and pfos at four
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion and the the result of
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
that is that there are going to be
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably on the order of another 150 to
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
200 Public Water Systems that will now
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
not meet the standard our previous
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
standard for pfoa and pfos were 12 and
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
15 respectively those are the current
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
state standards that we enforce but once
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
we adopt this four par petran standard
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
there will be at least 150 to 200 Public
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
additional Public Water Systems in the
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
state that don't meet the standard and
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
we'll have to put on treatment or find
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
some other solution to make sure that
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're supplying compliant water and
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
safe safe clean drinking water and uh
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
the the word for public or for private
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells we we can only
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
estimate that but we we know a fair lot
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
bit about it because we've sampled over
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
12,000 private drinking water wells over
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years for pasas and um we
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
based on the data we have and making
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
some reasonable projections we
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
potentially tens of thousands of private
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells that will be over
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
that four part petran standard so it's a
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
formidable problem you know the word
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
unprecedented is overused but I don't
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
think it's uh hyperbole in this case
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
this is an unprecedented impact of
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
drinking water in the state that we've
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
been dealing with over the last 10
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
years if I could follow up if I heard
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
you correctly earlier you said those
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to be near a
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
public uh Source could Poe T could
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
poet um but now what you're saying is
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the solution well
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
no so um and I want to draw a
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
distinction this this section seven of
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
this bill provides a very specific right
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
of action so if you are a person who um
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh whose well has been impacted by a
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
release from a past facility and you're
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
over the standard and you have not been
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
offered a solution from that party um
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
then this gives you a right of action to
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
to try to to get that from that party
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
the broader problem of Pas contamination
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the state is going to be addressed
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
through a variety of means the state has
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
already put tremendous resources to we
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
we we we Implement a rebate program
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
right now where people who have
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
contamination in their well over
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
standards that have not been offered
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
solution can put a point of entry
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
treatment system on and they're eligible
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
for um up to a $5,000 rebate to offset
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
the costs of that um and we also provide
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
up to 10,000 for connection to a water
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
system um so the the the solution to
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
these you know this new recognition that
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous number of increased
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
number of of of Wells that are
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
potentially going to be above this new
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
below this above this new standard
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
that's that there's going to be a
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
manifold solution for that it's going to
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
involve responsible parties it's going
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
to involve um New Hampshire state
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
government and the federal government
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government is is trying to
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
um or is uh appropriating resources to
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
address that they're probably not
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient to address the whole problem
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
but they are putting some money towards
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
it that that they're passing on to the
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
states other questions for this witness
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative trip thank you Mr
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh this new standard that uh is being
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
established is that going to be through
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh legislative or
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
regulations so the the the federal
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
government has implemented um and they
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it'll be published
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the Federal Register this month and
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
will likely be then officially effective
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
in in June
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
um that will be a federal drinking water
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
MCL um State programs across the country
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
um typically and and and state law
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
essentially um uh anticipates that the
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
state will adopt any federal MCL that's
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
adopted will generally be adopted by the
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
state it typically would be done by by
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
administrative rule although it could be
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
done by by law in the case of our
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
current P standards the the current P
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
drinking water standards in New
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were actually established by
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature back in 2019 as OPP and
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
then we we followed up with implementing
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but the actual setting those
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
standards was done by law so it could
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
happen either
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
way follow up please sure yes so
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
modification of Standards could be done
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
by the uh
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
Dees yes we are uh we are authorized by
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature under our state Safe
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Act and our groundwater
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
protection act to establish both
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard and um
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
groundwater standards thank you other
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
questions so I guess I have just a
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
couple of questions I want to make sure
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'm understand is am I understanding
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
from your testimony that at the present
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
time there is not a private right of
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
action for contamination of a well by P
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
um I and again I I am not an attorney so
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
tell you my understanding of it my
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that any party
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
could you know file a right of action
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
against or file a a suit against a
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
responsible party for who who they
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
believe is contaminated their well this
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
just provides an explicit right of
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
action the the the I think what this is
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do is provide firmer legal
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
legal legal U footing for for a person
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
who's trying to do that and it gives
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
them a specific goal that basically that
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
this this bill would say you can file
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
this action and under the law the party
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
would be responsible to provide you with
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
safe clean water in a very specific
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
way okay and can I just a couple of
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
other questions is that the
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
10,000 uh parts per trillion is that a
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
standard that was was one set by the
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
legislature as you or that was one set
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
by no no and actually the the the
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
original version of this bill that was
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced in the Senate set
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
it at a much lower standard at 100 parts
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
per trillion and to be very candid that
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
the business community and others were
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that they felt that
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
that was going to cast too wide a net
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to Pas contamination and so
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
um the senator was uh was willing to
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to raise that number to
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
10,000 that 10,000 based on the data we
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
have right now and it could change in
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
the future but the data we have right
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
now really probably applies to about
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
four facilities we we know that there
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
are about four facilities in the state
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that fit the definition of a
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and that they have released
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
past contamination and they have
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater at a
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
concentration greater than 10,000 parts
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
per trillion I think that the you know
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
at some level the Genesis of this bill
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
is in part you know our biggest site the
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
one associated with the St gobain
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
facility in
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
miramac has to be said has contaminated
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of drinking water wells and
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
the state negotiated consent agreement
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
with with st gobain back in
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
2018 I believe it was based on the
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
information we had about the occurrence
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
of the contaminant and the standard at
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
the time which was 70 parts per trillion
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
and basically that uh um consent
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
agreement under state law it gave the
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
state authority to or or it's
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
essentially it was agreed by the company
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
that within a certain boundary that was
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
drawn which included about it was huge
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
it was 5 T 64 square miles within that
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
boundary St gobain agreed to provide uh
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
ground uh alternate water for any
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
parties whose Wells they had
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated in that in that within that
 
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
contaminated in that in that within that
area

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
um outside of it under the terms of the
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
agreement they would only be responsible
 
00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.070 align:start position:0%
agreement they would only be responsible
under

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
State Dees authority to provide
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
alternate water if they contaminated
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
well Above That 70 par petran standard
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um that based on what we knew at the
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
time seemed like a reasonable approach
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
what we unfortunately learned later is
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
that in fact the their contamination
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
while we had a pretty good idea how how
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
far it spread we had no idea that the
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
standard would then be with based on new
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
toxicological data would be reduced
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
significantly down to 12 parts per
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
trillion and when you look at that same
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
map at 12 parts per trillion it was
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
clear to us that there were facilities
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
outside that consent decree boundary
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
that were contaminated above the 12 part
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
per trillion but then under the agency
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority under the
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
consent agreement to require the company
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
to provide alternate water to those
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
folks so there are several hundred if
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
not more than a thousand parties whose
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
Wells very likely were contaminated by
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
the company that um uh are not we're not
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
in a position to compel the company to
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
provide alternate water so what this
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
bill would do it's my understanding of
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
the Senator's desires was to help those
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
constituents of hers who who are very
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
likely impacted by the company's
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
contamination um but who are not they're
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
not being required to be provided with
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
alternate water because the state is
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
constrained by the terms of the consent
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
agreement so this gives them a firmer
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
legal footing to act on their
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
own and that would be true for other
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
facilities as well who meet the
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
definition so I I guess the thing I'm
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
not I'm not clear I understand if the if
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're saying that the
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
standard for when something is could be
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous to health so to speak is way
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
below 10,000 parts per trillion it's I
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned 70 so if that's true
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
why are we why are we limiting I mean it
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's we're we're we're
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
excluding from liability a
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
huge uh number of of uh polluters right
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
I I think it's important to understand
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
that the the 10,000 part per trillion is
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
an attempt to um limit this or or
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
address this private right of action to
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
the most significant sites in and
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
clearly that's one of the most
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
significant sites the other sites are
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
also large that that are the four sites
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
um needs to be said that the parties who
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
have contamination don't have to be
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated at 10,000 parts per
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
trillion this is the the 10,000 standard
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
is just to say if anywhere on the site
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
and basically these facilities have not
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
contaminated drinking water wells at
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
10,000 parts per trilon they've
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater near their near
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
their facility at that level so that
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
establishes them as is a very
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
significant major releaser of pasas once
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
you get through that hurdle you're
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're encompassed by this
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and then anybody whose well
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
you have impacted over the standard um
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
which is 12 right now and will likely be
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
four is is is eligible to to use the the
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of this law to get a some
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a remedy um and it also should
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
be said that this is not to say that a
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
party who has contaminated groundwater
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
at a lesser concentration than that
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
might not still have some liability
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
under the law this is just trying to
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
make explicit that if you are in this
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
larger category of a significant
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
releaser who's who's contaminated
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater at this very high level then
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
you you you there is an explicit right
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
of action for parties who have been
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
harmed by by your release even and if
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding even in other words if
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
you if you are a significant releaser MH
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
then you are subject to this and
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who may have been harmed even
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
by a significantly lower amount would
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
have the right to bring the action
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right so the with our
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
current law and if this bill were to
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
pass if you are a residential property
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
owner in Bedford who owns a home whose
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
well has been impacted by the releases
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
from the company um at 13 parts per
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
trillion your one part per trillion over
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
the 12 part per Tron standard this would
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this bill would apply
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
to you and you could you would have this
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
private right of action that's that's
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's how we understand it okay all
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
right just one final question I I see
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
and there was some mention um I think
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
during your testimony or maybe it was
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
the Senator's testimony about any person
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
who operates so I guess my question is
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
does this in other words if I'm if I'm
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh in some kind of supervisory position
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
let's say with st Caines am I personally
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
liable now for this or I don't think
 
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this this is a person you
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
know in terms of the legal definition as
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't have to tell you know
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
the definition of person has different
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
meanings in different um in in in
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
different uh um in different setting
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
different statutory Frameworks this I
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
believe this was just to make clear that
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it could
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
be I mean the definition for a past
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
facility is already relatively narrow
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
here it includes basically a facility
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
that's used these compounds in for
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing so basically that's
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
typically going to be a company or of of
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
some structure and it just the the RSA
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
147b I believe is generally used um
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
person to mean this particular thing but
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is I I'm not aware
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that anything in this imposes personal
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
individual liability on an employee of a
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
well I I I mean I you know the the
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
language says any person who owns and
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
owns I can understand you know that
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
presumably does not cover the employee
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
but any person who operates and so if
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the manager of St Goin uh am I
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
personally liable that's not been my
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the the the the
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
owner operator concept is the
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
longstanding language in this statute
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it's companion statute 147a and I
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
think the purpose of it is really to say
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
you might operate a manufacturing
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
facility on leased property so if you
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
just say owner and you're on a lease
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%
property then you could say well I'm not
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
an owner I just operate here so I think
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
really operators intended to be the
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
company that operates the facility even
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
if it's on leased property all right
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness being
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much sir thank you
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else who uh wishes to
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
413 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh Senate Bill
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
413 thank you very much uh and it's well
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
my I think that clock is a little bit
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
fast I think we got two
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you for chair no no
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah that would be great thank you
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
the next bill that's for the next bill
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
yeah uh what she's she's yeah I don't
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
know where Kaitlyn she's in Disney I
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
think she's in Disney she's in Disney
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
she's watching remotely iming these and
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
she's oh all right okay okay you guys
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
got everything covered that's
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I saw Tim yeah he he said he had to
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%

Carson good morning Mr chairman and good
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
morning members of the House judiciary
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Sharon Carson and I have the pleasure of
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 14
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
comprising the towns of londondary
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Auburn and I have for your
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning Senate Bill
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
422 which is changing several references
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
and modifying language in parentage and
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
birth records um this bill has been um
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
was amended in the Senate based upon the
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
number of of responses that we had
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
gotten because um in the original
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
language the uh terms mother and father
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
had been removed um so I worked with the
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys both our Senate attorney and
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
the attorneys that asked me to bring
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
this forward to put birth mother and
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
birth father back
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
in so what does this bill actually do
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
well this bill updates New Hampshire law
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
that a that so that the acknowledgement
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
of parentage or what is known as
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
aops um also called voluntary
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of parentage or vaps a
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
lot of acronyms here can be signed for
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
children born through assisted
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
reproduction and gam donation this means
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
more children can have their parentage
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
parentage established at close to birth
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
and through a voluntary process rather
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
than requiring their parents to go to
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
court to file leg legit
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
litigation this will also increase
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
court Mr chair I was astonished and I
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
learned this a few years ago that um
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
couples who had used assistant
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
reproduction actually had to go and
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
adopt their own
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
children um it was astounding that they
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
had to hire an attorney they had to go
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
through this legal process to have legal
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
rights for their own children and this
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill will help that
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
process um it's important that for these
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
children and their families to have
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
equal access to the security of legal
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
parentage and since vaps are equivalent
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
to court decrees this means New
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children will be protected
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
wherever they travel Senate Bill 422 has
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
been developed in cons in consultation
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire vital records and
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire child support um I had
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
also heard of children that were born
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
outside of marriage um where the other
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
party the birth father did not sign the
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
birth certificate and it came time to go
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
through um you know the couple separated
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
someone wants child support they have to
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
establish parentage first so if they
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
sign this form they're good to go and
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
and they're now legally responsible um
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
for those children what does it not do
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change who can be a
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
parent in New Hampshire it simply lets
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
current parents protect their children
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
through these
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
vaps why is this important it's a key
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
public policy goal to secure the
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
parentage of children efficiently and
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
soon after birth parentage is a source
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
of All rights and responsibilities for
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
children like health insurance financial
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
support and medical decision-making by
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
allowing children born through assisted
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
reproduction equal access to parentage
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
through a VAP form New Hampshire ensures
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
these children are protected more
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
quickly and without the expense and
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
delay of filing litigation in court why
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
is it important for efficiency right now
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
children born through assisted
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
reproduction can only be secured through
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
the court or the litigation process
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
whereas other children s can be secured
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
through an aop with this bill there
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
should be fewer cases going to court
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
because parents of children born through
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
assisted reproduction can use the aop
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
form like all other parents
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
do um who supports this bill this is a
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
common sense bill that enjoys the
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
support of the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
Association local practitioners and The
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
Academy of adoption and assisted
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
reproduction attorneys as well as
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
involvement from Key stakeholders like
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
vital records and child support this
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill is consistent with Federal
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
requirements as well as best practices
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
moving through other States since the
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
mid 1990s federal law has required each
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
state have a simple civil process to
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
establish parentage this is again the
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary acknowled acknowledgement of
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
parentage process the goal of this
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
Federal program is to ensure that
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
parents are secured to their children
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of support and health
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
insurance so parents are supporting
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
their children rather than the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
government each state has a VAP form and
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
a majority of children born to unmarried
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
mothers and fathers have their parentage
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
form uh parentage secured through the
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
VAP form states have moved as
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
recommended by the UPA of
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
2017 to expand access to VAP so that
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
more children can be secured through
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
this program 12 states have moved to
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
expand access to this process to more
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
children um Mr chairman
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
in in ackowledgement of time um I'm not
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
going to read the 12 States but um more
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
states have are doing this and have
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
actually filed um legislation this year
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
for this same process so at this point
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will conclude my testimony
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
if I will try to answer any questions
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
but uh the attorneys are here as well as
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
the department and they can speak to
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
that but I will try to answer some
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions great thank you thank you very
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%

representative Smith and I have to go uh
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave I'm going to turn
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing over to uh Vice chair
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
Wallace and we will be back as soon as
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
we can um I completely
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
understand yes rep representative
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
lonza um thank you for taking my
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
question I just have a question about uh
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
what happens when the father um does not
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
want to uh sign there are times that um
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a labor and delivery nurse so there
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
are times that um the fathers do not
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
sign um or the um couple has broken up
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
before they even um was they say come to
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
um so um thank you very much for the
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
question this is where I believe you're
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to go through the
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
courts um it's unfortunate uh when that
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
happens so you're going to have to
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
establish genetically the father's
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and then you're going to
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
have to go to court um where they will
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
be held legally responsible but this is
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
for people to do voluntarily and most
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
voluntarily representative trip thank
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr Vice chair thanks for taking my
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
question it uh I almost felt like it was
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
in a Schoolboard meeting when you were
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
giving your testimony because uh you
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
seem to like
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
acronyms representative they're not my
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
acronyms well hopefully you know what
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
they are uh what you use aops and
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
vaps could you yes the aops is called it
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the acknowledgement of
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
parentage and the
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
parentage that clears a lot of things up
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
assisted reproduction so I'm very
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with this process um
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
we did have to use a donor and I gave
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
birth to the twins almost 11 years ago
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and their father who I'm not married to
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
was able to sign what's known as a
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary acknowledgement of paternity
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it takes away
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the gender issues because what happens
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
is if a female couple who's unmarried
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
presents in the hospital at delivery
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
even if they used Anonymous donor sperm
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
at this point in time only the birth
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
parent can go on the birth certificate
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
and that then triggers the process for
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
the other partner to have to go to court
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
and establish their parentage so even
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
though they selected the donor together
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
they paid for the sperm together they
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
did all they're living together they're
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining a household they're
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
responsible they may even be on the
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
non-birth parents Insurance the child
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
they can't legally establish their um
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
parentage without that court process and
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
this um this body actually helped us fix
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
that process a couple years back so this
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
really is I think I've lost a little bit
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
of but I think we're on our third bill
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
that has taken a lot of our different
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
statutes because they are scattered
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the code and updated them to
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
be consistent with each other to be
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law and to make
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure that all families are protected and
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
that we have now covered all of these
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
various ways that they can be covered so
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative lansa to answer your
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
question when a person doesn't want to
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
sign that could be the father
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
genetically but it may also be a couple
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
who in the course of creating their uh
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
procuring their donor sperm and having
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy may have split up that
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
happens too I had an attorney consult
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
with me just this month on that type of
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
an issue and now what happens so it
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
could be either a male or female person
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem right currently
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
our hospitals our nurses are faced with
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
this awkwardness of asking these
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions instead of just registering
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
the birth the way the couple intended um
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
at the Judiciary um in the Senate there
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
was very powerful testimony read by an
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
attorney who had assisted a couple faced
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
with that situation where the paperwork
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
had all been filled out and then the
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
registar said oh wait you're married
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
right and they said no we're not married
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
and she ripped up the paperwork so very
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
tra IC to them to be having just given
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
birth and to have someone rip up the
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork that supported both of their
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
names being on the birth
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
certificate um we had made attempts over
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
the last several years to see if we
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
could fix this problem through our um
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
administrative offices but this code
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
these Provisions fall in both DHHS and
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
vital records and so the complexity
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
there and the number of sections that
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
were impacted ultimately it was decid
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it is by bringing
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
this bill um and we really thank um
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and all of the
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors for their support I'm happy
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
to answer questions um but I do think
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's a just really basic Common Sense
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill that's long
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
overdue representative trip Mr chair
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you use
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
the uh phras establishing their
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
parentage could you explain what that
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
means sure so under um current law we
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
have two ways of that happening the
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
first is what's known as a marital
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
presumption so when a person gives birth
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
their spouse is automatically presumed
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
to be the parent even if they are not
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
genetically the parent and automatically
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
both people will be placed on the birth
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
certificate it's what's known as a
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption so they could
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could challenge that with a
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
court action to remove the non- genetic
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
person from the birth certificate
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
through litigation so that's the first
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
way that parentage can be established is
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
that marital presumption the person that
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
gives birth is automatically considered
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
the parent unless it was through just
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
stational care uh sergy which is a whole
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
separate process I don't want to confuse
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
us but we addressed the problems there
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
too last year um so if it's the
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
automatically the birth parent goes on
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
the certificate and their
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
spouse when they're not married the only
 
00:45:59.549 --> 00:45:59.559 align:start position:0%
way for the non-birth parent to do that
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
is through a voluntary acknowledgement
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
form currently it is only for paternity
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
only a male can sign it and so it's
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
leaving a group of people and their
 
00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:15.630 align:start position:0%
leaving a group of people and their
children

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
unprotected does that further follow up
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
followup please
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh I I assume that the term
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
parentage uh involves certain rights and
 
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.910 align:start position:0%
parentage uh involves certain rights and
responsibilities

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
correct yes and they are they are
 
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
financial support um they are care what
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
we we we as attorneys talk about care
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
custody and control you have the right
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
to parenting time even if if you live in
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
separate houses you have the right to um
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
make medical decisions you have the
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
right to make educational decisions and
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
you have a financial responsibility to
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
support the
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
child thank you you're so
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
Lonzo thank you for taking my question I
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
just have a quick question about um so
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
if you have two male um uh couple and
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
they had um had a um person that was I
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
say um they used as um the do I guess
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
the um they would use an egg donor andal
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
carrier right and so um what is the
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
process that they have have to go um
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
through afterwards um because one of
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
them will be the I guess considered
 
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
father and um do they then have to go to
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
court after that so that is that is the
 
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.109 align:start position:0%
court after that so that is that is the
um

00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
169 sorry
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
168b um that chapter addresses just
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
stational carriers and how that works
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so anybody who's using a surrogate
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
for to carry the birth would go through
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
a parentage petition in the probate
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
division of our circuit court that
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
actually happens before birth so this
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
bill does not apply to couples who use a
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
gestational carrier because their
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
parentage is going to be established
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
before the carrier gives birth so that's
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
already been happening we've been um and
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
as I said we updated that chapter last
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
year um and so they are going to both
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
both parents regardless of gender are
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
going to be named right from birth
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have a court
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
order before the baby's even delivered
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
um there it does the statute does allow
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
for it to happen after the fact um and
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
that does sometimes need to happen
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and then also sometimes babies are
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
born early and the courts just haven't
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
gotten to issuing the order yet so we do
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do it after birth
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
but I would I don't have the stats on it
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
but I would Hazard that almost all are
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
birth follow up please
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
and am I correct in saying that um many
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
other states do not allow that to occur
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
but this um in our state we do allow
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
that allow which to have a um was let
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
you say the Don the donor and they have
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
a two like male couple and surrogacy
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
yeah um actually that's not accurate um
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
we with respect to uh
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
surrogacy um there's only at this point
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
in time I think two or three states left
 
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
where it is um not allowed and it can
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
even be a criminal act Michigan just
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
overturned in the past month their
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
statute that was um made it criminal uh
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
New York did a few years ago New Jersey
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
a few years before that so we're
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
actually at a point in time now where
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
almost all 50 states are allowing sorcy
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
the process may look a little different
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
from state to state of how that
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
parentage is established but that is
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
that does exist and with vaps as Senator
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
Carson um testified to we have um we're
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
now at 12 Michigan being the most recent
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
and that literally has been since we
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
were over in um the Senate on this bill
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
um so they're the most recent we are the
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
only New England State at this time that
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
does not have this uh gender neutral
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
approach and I and just another point of
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
clarification also um our version also
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
will allow married couples to do this so
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's not uh just
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
Oregan I know
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess the uh we're still using the
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
word mother in there which will probably
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh make it easier to get this bill
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
passed through the house um which is so
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
is there I guess there isn't actually a
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
definition of of mother I know there's
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
controversy over like using a different
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
term since sometimes someone who
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
identifies as nonbinary or even male
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
whether in transition can get pregnant
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
and even give birth and uh which which I
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
think is fine but to that I'm sorry I'm
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
sorry to overp speak you um that was why
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment was brought in the Senate
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
was to make sure we you our goal was to
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
keep it as gender neutral as possible
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
that was that were there was push back
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
as Senator Carson uh testified to and so
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
that is why the
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
amendment all right
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions seeing none
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank

um we support updating the language in

the birth worksheet and birth records to
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
make the forms more inclusive by using
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
terms such as birth parent and non-birth
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
parent updating the language in these
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
documents will help ensure all patients

administers the child support program
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was established uh through the
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
title uh Roman numeral 4D uh part of the
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act of
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
1975 um as it was already mentioned uh
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
one of the primary
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the child support
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
program uh is to uh
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
establish uh paternity currently or
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
legal fatherhood and or
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
parentage um we are here today uh to
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
provide information uh to the committee
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh just in relation to some some of the
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
potential implementation of the changes
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh as proposed in the bill uh because of
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
our Administration over the existing uh
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
Affidavit of paternity form and
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent procedures um so as a you
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
know we are certainly the department is
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of the intent uh and the
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
goals um and these uh language changes
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
do align with what we know our federal
 
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
partners of our office of child Support
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
Services is also recommending for
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
proposed rule
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
changes uh uh relative to shifting
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
language from paternity to parentage in
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
those regulations to which our program
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
is required uh to adhere to um it
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
already has been stated that uh
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
parentage establishment is necessary
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
first step in our child support
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
processes um when children are born out
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
of marriage um and the bill uh doesn't
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
conflict uh as it is currently written
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
with our ability to operate our continue
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
to operate our state child program nor
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
does it limit our ability to continue to
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
pursue our core functions um and we have
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
a great working relationship and
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
partnership with our Vital Records our
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
state Vital Records Division
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration with them and the other
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so we feel uh that any of
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
the changes that are made should this
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill be enacted uh we should be able to
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
implement and absorb those uh changes
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
within our existing resources we
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%

effective date of uh July 1 2025 that
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
any of the necessary changes that may be
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
needed to our forms and training um and
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
yours good morning Mr chairman um and
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Sharon
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
Carson and I have the pleasure of
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 14
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
comprising the towns of London da Hudson
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
and Auburn and I have for your
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning Senate Bill
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
462 which seeks to raise the cap on
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
Damages for wrongful death loss of
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims um Mr chairman this
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill started out as eliminating the Caps
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but during the Senate public hearing
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
we got a tremendous amount of push back
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
from the insurance industry they really
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep the caps in place so in
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
an effort to compromise we did that and
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
what we ended up doing was raising the
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
amount um from 300,000 to 5 uh excuse me
 
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.870 align:start position:0%
amount um from 300,000 to 5 uh excuse me
from

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
150,000 to
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
500,000 I think it's important to
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
realize that the caps for this has they
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
have not changed in 30 years um it has
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
been it has been artificially low so um
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change anything in the
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
current statute but the amount of
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
Damages that can be recovered by a
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
spouse or minor child for the loss of
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the enjoyment of their loved ones life
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
if they were killed by the negligence of
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
another um these claims again are very
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
limited in scope and can be very very
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove in New Hampshire we
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
have a long tradition in the belief and
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
Trust in the right to trial by a jury of
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
one of our peers who would be
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
determining exactly what the damages
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
would be um there's a couple of points
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that I I would like to make our level of
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
compensation is so low that the federal
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
government when determining cases in New
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not use our number in
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
fact they use the state of which is a
 
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.910 align:start position:0%
fact they use the state of which is a
million

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
do um I the other thing I would like to
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
point out there's a couple points um say
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
you decide you're going to go over to
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
Maine um we got great Seafood in New
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but some people like to go to
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
Maine to have a seafood dinner
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
especially if you're close um you live
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
along the border um and if you should
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
lose your spouse say in an automobile
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
accident due to the negligence of
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
another person their life is worth a
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars but if you were to have
 
01:03:58.349 --> 01:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
that same accident in New Hampshire it's
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
only worth
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
150 so we're trying to raise this um one
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that we heard was it's
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
going to raise insurance rates and I
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
think this is something that we are all
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of and I've handed a copy
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
of a recent article on dated April
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
19th um from the union leader that talks
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
about insurance premiums are on the rise
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
and and here's why and it's because of
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
weather related industry accidents and
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
things that are happening people are
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of property damage so um
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear the insurance
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
industry talk about oh my God the
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
insurance rates are going to rise well
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
guess what folks they're go they're
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
going to rise anyway these are not
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
claims that are come forward very often
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
so I think it's time that we raise these
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
rates um to reflect today's prices um
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
and really quite
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
frankly $500,000 can that compensate you
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
for the loss of your
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
spouse um or your children's mother or
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
their your children's father think about
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
what it costs to raise a child today and
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
if you lose one of the individuals in
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
your family who contributes financially
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
think about this the mother who's now a
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
single mom and she's now has to raise
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
those children yes there might be other
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
sources that you can tap into but you've
 
01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
got to now go back to work you have to
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
pay for daycare and I think we've had
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
really great discussions about the cost
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
of daycare if you can find it here in
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the cost of educating and
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
raising a child so every little bit
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
helps and all we're trying to do is to
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
help those who through no fault of their
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
own they've lost they're a loved one and
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
now they're left alone so um at this
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
point I will conclude my testimony Mr
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
chairman um there are uh folks there are
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks here that will probably
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
want to discuss this with you um who
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
have uh other pertinent points that
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
they'd like to make so at this point I
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
will conclude my testimony thank you rep
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%

Haynes thank you chairman Wallace and

thank you members of the committee for
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify today I am here
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
Association for justice as well as all
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
of my clients my name is Holly Haynes I
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
am an attorney in Manchester New
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I practice medical
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
malpractice and personal injury law I've
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
represented numerous Estates of
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
claimants who have been killed by
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
negligence as well as who have been
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
permanently harmed by negligence and I
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
can tell you unequivocally that the loss
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
of a spouse or a loved one the loss of a
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
familial relation relationship impacts
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens exactly the same
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
way whether their loved one is killed by
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
negligent conduct or permanently harmed
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
by negligent
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
conduct what's not the same is how the
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
law treats those two losses and this
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
disparity later in my testimony I'm
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
going to give you an example of the
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
disperate impact that this law has on
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
families who are per who lose a loved
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
one to death versus someone who is
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophically injured but before I do
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
I know that there are a lot of concerns
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a significant expansion of
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
the law a significant change in the law
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
and I want to tell you that nothing
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
could be further from the case this bill
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
is extremely narrow in scope it doesn't
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
create any new causes of action it is
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
not going to increase the number of
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that businesses
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
face it's not going to create any new
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
classes of plaintiffs or any new classes
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
of claims that people can bring
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require any additional proof
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
at trial that's going to increase
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
litigation costs and it doesn't increase
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
or create any new elements of claims all
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
that it does is raise the arbitrary cap
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
that exists on Damages for claims for
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
loss of familiar
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
relationship I'm sure that you are going
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
to hear during the course of this
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
hearing from uh representatives of the
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
insurance industry who are going to
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
express concerns about the increased
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums and how it's going to
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
drive business out of New Hampshire
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
these concerns are not well founded
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
though because if loss of Consortium
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
claims are considered at all in
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
establishing their premiums which I
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
submit they probably are not um
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and insurers already have to
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
consider those because law of Consortium
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
claims are brought with any injury
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
action this is the only one that has a
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
cap on it loss of Consortium claims are
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
derivative of the underlying negligence
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
claim insurers are already uring
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
themselves against loss they're
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
Insurance insuring them themselves
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
against claims this Consortium claim is
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
only part of that underlying claim it's
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
not a separate claim it is not going to
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
change any of their reserves or their
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
premiums at its Essence this bill is
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
just going to make the wrongful death
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
statute comport with existing negligence
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
claims and right now it's the only
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
existing cap on tort damages other than
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
for volunteers at nonprofit
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
organizations or for the limited caps
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
for sovereign immunity proc claims
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
against the state or counties or
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities another concern you're
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to hear is that eliminating this
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
cap will likely result in more claims
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
being filed or create the potential for
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
Runaway Jury verdicts and I'm going to
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
explain to you why that's not the case
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
by telling you how these claims actually
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire and what's
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire as well as
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the other New
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
England states regarding Consortium
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
claim claims and the practical
 
01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
application and disperate impact this
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
has no one who testifies today is going
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
to tell you that there are frivolous
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in New Hampshire no one's going
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
to tell you that the costs of lawsuits
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
have driven up insurance premiums or
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
costs in New Hampshire and the reasons
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
for this are three-fold New Hampshire is
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
a very very small state lawyers value
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
their reputations we pride ourselves on
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
our reputations in the community with
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
the courts and with our opposing
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
councils we take our job very seriously
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
and we don't bring claims that don't
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
have Merit because that's not going to
 
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.070 align:start position:0%
have Merit because that's not going to
benefit

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
anyone the New Hampshire Civil Justice
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
System and jury system guaranteed by our
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
constitution also works jurors in New
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire take their civic duty very
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
seriously they do not they listen to the
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
evidence in each case they follow the
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
law they don't award runaway
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
verdicts I'm sure all of you know you've
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
never seen any headlines in New
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about Runaway verdicts that
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
you see in other states because they
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
just don't happen and if there is one
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
the judge has the power to reduce that
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
Verdict by reditor it's completely
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
within the discretion of the court and
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be created or limited
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
legislature finally there are really
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
strong financial disincentives to
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
Bringing fris claims it costs a lot of
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
money to bring a medical malpractice or
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
wrongful death lawsuit often hundreds of
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars are spent just on
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
Expert Witnesses alone to bring these
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
claims and if a meritorious case loses
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
at trial those costs are borne by the
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers they aren't going to bring that
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
claim PR frivolously because they're
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
never going to recoup those
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
costs the contingency Fe method for
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
payment for attorneys also prevents
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
privis claims from being
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
filed if an attorney's not successful in
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
getting a verdict or settlement they
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going to get paid so they aren't
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to bring a frivolous claim that
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
they don't think is going to be
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
successful uccessful we take a lot of
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
time and we spend a lot of money in
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
screening all claims that we bring at
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
our office
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
and before we decide to bring a claim we
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
probably take one out of a 100 cases
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
that come through our doors or who
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
contact our office they are few and far
 
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.550 align:start position:0%
contact our office they are few and far
between

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
and wrongful death claims are even
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
fewer this is how claims work in a
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
traditional case if a medical
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
malpractice case comes to our office for
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
a someone's wrongful death we meet with
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the estate representative or family
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
member to find out exactly what happened
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
after that meeting we spend thousands of
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
dollars getting all of the victim's
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
medical records having them reviewed by
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
medical experts in the appropriate
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
Specialties to determine whether or not
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
negligence if our expert doesn't give us
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
a positive opinion we decline the case
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
we may have spent thousands of dollars
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
but we're going to decline the case we
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
aren't going to pursue that case
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
frivolously expert Witnesses cost
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes up to $1,000 an hour just to
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
review a case they are making money off
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
of these cases it's
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
not the plaintiffs who are bringing
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
them we only file suit if a medical
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
expert gives us support that medical
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
negligence happened and that the
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
death and it's really important to note
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
that there can be no Consortium claim
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
unless there is an underlying
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice claim or an underlying
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
wrongful death
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
claim also the damages for wrongful
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
death claims are limited by Statute it's
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
a creature of Statute it was created by
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
Statute it didn't exist at the common
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
law all the plaintiffs are allowed to
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
recover in wrongful death claims are
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
their conscious pain and suffering
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
before death their medical bills and
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
funeral expenses that they
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
incur the duration of life and years of
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
life that they've lost their life
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
expectancy the Lost earnings and their
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
earning capacity and then the lck loss
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
of comfort companionship and society
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
that is the Consortium claim that is
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
suffered by the spouse or the
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
children in many cases a victim is
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
killed instantaneously in a car accident
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
or during a medical procedure so there's
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
no conscious pain or suffering that can
 
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
no conscious pain or suffering that can
be

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
claimed in cases where a decedent is
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
unemployed if they're a homemaker if
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're retired if they're disabled
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
probably the people who have the
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
greatest Financial need there are going
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
to be no economic losses that can be
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
claimed because they don't have lost
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
wages that can be claimed they don't
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
have those financial um expenses to
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
claim the only damages in those cases
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
that can be claimed are the loss of the
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
familiar relationship and the loss of
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the life and I submit to
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
you no one's spouse I don't think anyone
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
would place a value of $150,000 on their
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
spouse's life or $50,000 on their
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
child's life if a child loses a parent I
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
think anyone would give any amount of
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
money to get that person back and not to
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
trial thankfully in New Hampshire
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
wrongful death cases are very few and
 
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
wrongful death cases are very few and
far

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
between they only happen when another
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen or business kills
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
another New Hampshire citizen through
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
their negligent conduct the only way to
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
reduce and eliminate wrongful death
 
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
reduce and eliminate wrongful death
claims

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
is to reduce and eliminate negligent
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
conduct that's how we get rid of them
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
and that's how we prevent them and
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the only way to do that is
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
to make people pay compensation when
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
they act
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
negligently wrongful death claims with
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims are even fewer and far
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
between because it means that the person
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
who was killed left behind a spouse or a
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
minor child and wrongful death claims
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
that are going to get compensation under
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
are the ones where where the family
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
members needed the most because they
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have economic losses that can be
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
recovered for the loss of their loved
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
one by way of example um if a person or
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
business causes a drunk driving crash
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
and the driver has a policy limit of a
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars if the person killed was
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
a young physician who's making hundreds
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars a year who has a
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
young spouse young
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
children the estate of that position is
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
going to get the entire $1 million
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
policy limit without ever reaching the
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Consortium claim because the Physicians
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
lost wages lost earnings and economic
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
losses to the estate are going to take
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
the entire policy limit in that case the
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
Consortium claim doesn't even come into
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
play because it doesn't trigger
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
additional policy limits our Supreme
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
Court decided that in 2006 it's not
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to change anything in that claim
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
at all in contrast so if the drunk
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
driving accident happens and the deedon
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
is a home uh Homemaker who homeschools
 
01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:23.830 align:start position:0%
is a home uh Homemaker who homeschools
her

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
children there are no lost wages there
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
are no lost earnings and there are no
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
economic losses that family is going to
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
be limited to the loss of the life and
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
the $150,000 for the loss of the spouse
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
and $50,000 for the loss of the parent
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be such a disparity just
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
because someone is making a lot of money
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
or has a higher profession or higher
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
wage New Hampshire's citizens lives are
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
same if
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
in all catastrophic cases in each case
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
where the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
has struck down damage caps as being
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um in fact our Supreme
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
Court has done that in every case that
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
they've addressed damage caps and it's
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
seminal case of Parson versus Moore
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
which I um outlined in my written
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
testimony the Supreme Court explained
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
why caps on Damages are unconstitutional
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
and made clear quote recovery of only a
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
limited portion of damages cannot be the
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent to recovery of such damages
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
in full Society cannot Escape its
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to its
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
citizens to provide Justice simply by
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating the rights of its citizens
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law has not kept up with
 
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law has not kept up with
this

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
principle this is what's happening in
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
other states we're the only New England
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
state with a cap on Damages for wrongful
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
death of less than a million dollar
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts Connecticut and
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island have no
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
caps um main is the only other state in
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
New England that has a cap on Damages
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
and its current cap is a million dollar
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
New York prohibits damages caps and
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
wrongful death cases in its
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution our federal court in 2011
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
in a choice of law analysis uh
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
recognized that New Hampshire had not
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
kept up with its fellow New England
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
states and had not kept up with the rest
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the country in that case um now
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
deceased judge de clerico observed that
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lies in quote the
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
Backwater of the modern stream
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
for damages and wrongful death cases and
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
when he was given the choice to apply
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
Maine or New Hampshire law he chose to
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
apply Main's law because it would better
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
serve the end of ends of justice for our
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen who was a plup in
 
01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:44.149 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen who was a plup in
that

01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
case I want to tell you about a client
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
of mine to give you the more practical
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
application of this damages cap in
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
action um I've represented a 41-year-old
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
Navy veteran uh Carol
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
Martin she was married for 20 years to
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
her husband Gary
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
Martin she had four children who she
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooled they all had special needs
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
um one of them had severe
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
autism the mother suffered a back injury
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
and she went to our VA Medical Center
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
she had a back injury in the Navy and
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
she exacerbated it when she fell at home
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
despite being opiate naive which means
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
she didn't take opiate medications
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
regularly um the doctors threw p
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
medication at her they threw a fenel
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
patch which they replaced in 2 days with
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
the fenel patch triple the dose they
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
discharged her with prescriptions for
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
morphine and oxycoton along with 10
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl patches and they sent her home
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
and this wife and mother died in her bed
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
she was found by two of her children of
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
an opiate overdose because of
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
overprescribing by PHS the children at
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
the time she died were 9 11 15 and 17
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 17-year-old was just 10 days shy of
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
his 18th birthday had he been 18 he
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had a claim at all that
 
01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had a claim at all that
shouldn't

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
happen there was no wage claim to be
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
made because she was a homemaker and she
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
homeschooled her kids in fact in that
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
case which was a federal twer claim in
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
federal court the defense Economist
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
actually testified that the estate
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
suffered a negative net economic loss
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
meaning they benefited positively from
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the death of this woman because she
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
would have consumed more over her
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
lifetime than she contributed
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
economically that can't be the way we
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
value wrongful death cases her husband
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
her children all suffered
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophically her children suffered
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
to this day they had to transition to
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
public school they had special needs and
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
autism the IEPs they needed one couldn't
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
finish school others are still suffering
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
to this day and their claims were
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
limited to $50,000 because of the
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
statute those children deserved a lot
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
more more her husband was limited to
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
$150,000 the oldest son would have
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
gotten nothing if it had been 10 days
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
later in contrast I represented another
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
family involving a 50-year-old wife and
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
mother who was rendered functionally a
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
newborn after medical procedures were
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
mismanaged um to treat an unruptured
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
inter cranial aneurysm and it resulted
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
in multiple frontal L Strokes she was
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
left partially paralyzed she lost her
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
memory she lost her recognition of her
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
husband and her children she didn't
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
recognize any family members she was
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
placed in a home for brain injured
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
patients in the North Country her
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
husband of more than 20 years was left
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
without his wife her five children two
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
who were adopted were left without a
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
mother she too wasn't working she helped
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
out in the family business just keeping
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
the books and she homeschooled her
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
children so she too didn't have a wage
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
loss claim in that case though the
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
Probate Judge awarded more than half of
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the malpractice settlement to the
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
husband and the family for the loss of
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the familial relationship of their
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
mother and wife and had his wife died as
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to being
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
rendered permanently disabled he would
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
have been limited to
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
$150,000 their losses were very much the
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
same they both completely lost their
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
spouses and parents but the outcomes of
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
what they were able to recover was
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
dressed ically different and I submit to
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
you that isn't the way that the law
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.790 align:start position:0%
you that isn't the way that the law
should

01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
work the damages cap that we have right
 
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
now is arbitrary it's irrational and it
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
has not changed in 30 years it is so low
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
um I do know that several people have
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
submitted valid concerns I saw a letter
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
from the nurse practitioner administ uh
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
Association I know that the hospital
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
Association other medical associations
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
have many valid concerns um that are
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
well founded about cost of malpractice
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
premiums and about obstetrical providers
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
being driven out of the state or
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
neurologic providers or nurse
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners being driven out of
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
business I submit to you that those have
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the statute though
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
the statute does not impact those claims
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
at all malpractice
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
claims involving birth injuries or
 
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.590 align:start position:0%
claims involving birth injuries or
neurologic

01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
neurologic
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
injuries the reason that the awards are
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
much higher and premiums are higher is
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
because when there is a birth injury a
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
child is profoundly disabled for the
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
rest of their life and the recovery is
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
based on the Life Care needs of that
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
person it's not because it's a wrongful
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
death case malpractice premiums in all
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
of those cases and business
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
premiums go solely to General negligence
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
claims they have nothing to do with
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
wrongful death claims and this statute
 
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
will have absolutely no impact on that
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
um because of that I respectfully spit
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
that those concerns while they are valid
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with the statute so
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
here what isn't going to happen in if
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
this statute is enacted and our caps are
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
raised is um people are going to tell
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
you the sky is going to fall businesses
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
are going to run out of the state people
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
won't be able to get insurance and
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's just not true the state of Maine
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
in 1997 when we enacted our first cap on
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
damages of $150,000
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
had the exact same cap of
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
$150,000 I suspect that's where we got
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
our number from when we enacted that
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
statute since that time Maine increased
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
their cap to
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
250,000 then to 500,000 then to 750,000
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
and now it's at a million as of 2023
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
with annual increases for
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
inflation insurance companies have not
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
left the state of Maine businesses have
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
not fallen in the state of Maine because
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
of these changes to their
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
statute and the reasons that the sky
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
isn't going to fall are the exact
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that our Supreme Court
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
recognized in 1980 in Carson versus
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
Moore wrongful death claims are few and
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
far between very few cases in the state
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire ever even reached the
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
threshold of
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
$250,000 damage awards are a very small
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
fraction of insurance premium costs
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
there are fewer wrongful death cases
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
than negligence claims in the state
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
businesses are already considering
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
negligence claims in their business
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
decisions we don't have runaway juries
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the New Hampshire jury
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
system works and if a verdict is excess
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
of our judges
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
including uh former Chief Justice Lynn
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
will reduce that verdict because they
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
know what is reasonable and what should
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
be happening in the New Hampshire Civil
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
Justice System for all of these reasons
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask that you vote that
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass when this comes
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
out of committee and I'm happy to take
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
for representative Manos thank you thank
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
you attorney Haynes I wanted to ask um
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
regarding loss of Consortium claims what
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
percentage are settled before suit is
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
filed what percentage are settled after
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
suit is filed and what percentage go to
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
trial so I don't think I can give you
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
that answer with regard
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
to even any claims I can tell you the
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
vast majority do not go to trial
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims don't exist unless
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
there is an underlying claim we can't
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
file suit for a loss of Consortium in
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's just it's not an
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
independent cause of action so regular
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
negligence claims the vast majority
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
probably more than 90% will resolve
 
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.870 align:start position:0%
probably more than 90% will resolve
before

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
trial um I asked specifically about the
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
loss of Consortium because there can
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
obviously be a negligence claim that
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a Consortium component to
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
it you could have uh an unmarried person
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
who dies without children and um that's
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
why I phrased it in terms of loss of
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
Consortium um the other thing I wanted
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
to know is do you know the total number
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
of claims that
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
are um active in any particular year
 
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
are um active in any particular year
approximately

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't and we actually because this
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
statute applies just to wrongful death
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
claims we actually contacted the Circuit
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
Court Administrative Office in Probate
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
Court to try to determine that because
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's really the only way and they
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
weren't able to give us those statistics
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
sorry representative lonza thank you for
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just was curious
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer so I'm um what is a
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
runaway uh
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
verdict well
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anyone has ever read the
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
John Grisham novel Runaway Runaway Jury
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
I I think colloquially people consider
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
runaway verdicts to be those ones that
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
you hear about in huge product liability
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
cases like $56 million or um just
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar verdicts that they
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
just don't happen in New Hampshire
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire doesn't allow
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
punitive or punishment damages to be
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
granted by a jury right thank
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Divine thank you for
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your opinion why
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you think that we haven't in New
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire raised it to a million instead
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the 500,000 or the
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
300,000 thank you for your question
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
representative Divine uh this bill
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
initially was trying to eliminate the
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
caps in its entirety which I think would
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
be the correct outcome here I think
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the outcome should be at the
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing there
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
were suggestions to match Main and habit
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
a million dollars and I believe it was
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
just um all of the conversations between
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
the differing interests um and
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders such as the insurance
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
companies and different medical and
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care associations that the
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
$500,000 representative Tura thanks and
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking the question um so
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
also not a lawyer
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
um I it would be helpful to understand a
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
little bit uh the the other kinds of
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
Damages that are not covered by this you
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
sort of mentioned are are there's sort
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
of a formulaic or economic basis for how
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
those are
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
established could you say a word or two
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
about how loss of Consortium damages are
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
established and has there ever been any
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
attempt to sort of say what the right
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
number is I understanding that that you
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
think or that you you propose that no
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
cap would necessarily be but I'm not
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
sure how these actually
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
in in practice are set if that question
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you for your question
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative um and I'm not sure that
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
anyone knows how those determinations
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
are made it's actually within the
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
province of the jury the jury bases
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
their decision on their own life
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
experiences their
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
own feelings on the value of human life
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
of spousal relationships of Parental
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
relationships there is no formula
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
there's no law there is nothing and uh
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
our Supreme Court has recognized it
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
often it's very difficult for a jury to
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
calculate these subjective types of
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
Damages because there isn't a formula
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
for it but we trust jurors and we trust
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
the jury system to make the right
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
decision based on their combined
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
experiences that's why we have a jury of
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
12 people from different backgrounds
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
different walks of life different life
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
experiences who all come together and
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
they have to reach an agreement based on
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
their own experiences as to what they
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
feel the appropriate value should be
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yeah um did I
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
that judges overseeing these cases do
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to knock
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
down uh something that they think is
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and would in this
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
circumstance regardless of the cap or or
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
not they have the power of remor it's
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
called remor where they can remit or
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
reduce a jury verdict if the judge finds
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
it excessive in their discretion
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
I think it very rarely happens because
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
most judges will defer to the wisdom of
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
the jury because our our juries jurors
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampture are very conscientious
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful in the decisions that
 
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.109 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful in the decisions that
they

01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
make any other questions for attorney
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
Haynes seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning to
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
you all and thank you for allowing me to
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
speak to you today my name is Joan peso

New Hampshire and I'm speaking in strong
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to Senate Bill
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
462 we have all seen our insurance
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
premiums go up over the last year and
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
many of you may have heard the term hard
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
Market from your insurance agent or from
 
01:33:41.119 --> 01:33:42.350 align:start position:0%
Market from your insurance agent or from
testimony

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
given insurance has been My Chosen
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
career since
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
1979 and although we've had hard markets
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the past this one has been the most
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
severe there are number of reasons for
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
the current hard Market but the point of
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this up is that every consumer
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
both on a personal basis and as a
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
business owner is seeing their insurance
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
premiums go up this is not the time to
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
bring legislation that will cause
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums to go up even
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
more I understand the point that is
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
being made about that these caps have
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
been in place since legislation was
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
passed in the 90s and a point was made
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor that that insurance
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
premiums are going up anyway both are
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
accurate but by passing this bill or
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
bills like it we'll make insurance
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
premiums go up even more it's naive to
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
think that insurance coverages can be
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
increased and that's what's happening by
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
increasing caps and premiums are going
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
to stay the same insurance carriers
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
cannot absorb additional exposures
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
without increasing
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
premiums and regarding the cap staying
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
the same since the legislation was put
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
into place there have been no studies
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
done here in New Hampshire that would
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
provide Actuarial data indicating the
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
Caps are
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
insufficient much has been said about
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire having woefully low caps
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
but when you look at other states many
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't have additional loss of Consortium
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
coverages like New Hampshire does and
 
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
even if New Hampshire caps are lower
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
than other states it doesn't mean mean
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
that theirs are right and ours are
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
wrong I go back to the fact that those
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
who brought this legislation or brought
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
this bill forward should have had an
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
Actuarial study done to show
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
definitively that the Caps are too low
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
and that the amount of increase that is
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
supported by the in by the
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
study again to my knowledge that has not
 
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.629 align:start position:0%
study again to my knowledge that has not
been

01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
done I have provided some what I
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
consider to be very interesting
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
information on wrongful death
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
settlements from a law firm here in New
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these settlements range from a
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
low of $900,000 to a high of over $4.2
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
million from another Law Firm the
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
settlements ranged from a low of $2
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
million to a high of $15
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
million ladies and gentlemen having lost
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
a loved one I know there is no amount of
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
money that can ease the grief and loss
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
there is no amount of money that can
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
compensate for the loss of a child there
 
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.950 align:start position:0%
compensate for the loss of a child there
just

01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
isn't I was in a meeting recently where
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner betancort was the speaker
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
he made some very good points but one
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
that applies here he said insurance
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
company executives are not sitting in
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
their offices plotting ways to break
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire Insurance Market
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the volume that would
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
hit their radar
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
what we have is a healthy Insurance
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
environment one where insurance carriers
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
want to be here offering their products
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be making arbitrary changes
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
to insurance laws that could tip the
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
scales the other way making New
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a place where insurance
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
carriers decide to
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
leave I respectfully ask that you itl
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
than a bill
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
462 or if you're reluctant to do that
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
that you hold this bill in an interim
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
study and direct the insurance
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
department to conduct an Actuarial study
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'm happy
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this witness
 
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.229 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for this witness
representative

01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
tur thanks and thanks for taking the
 
01:37:43.229 --> 01:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
question I it sort of follow on to the
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
question I asked the previous witness
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
because you're you're mentioning that
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
there could or should be an Actuarial
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
study done to do this I guess given the
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
sort of morph nature of what the damages
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
achieve what could you say a word about
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
what an actual aial study would be
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
seeking to solve um or what what what
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
what it would be trying to
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
estimate thank you for the
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
question what I believe an Actuarial
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
study would show is number one are the
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
Caps sufficient are they being
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
used number two what is the impact going
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
to be if we don't have an increase in
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
the cap what is the impact going to be
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
for insurance premiums or the
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
availability of insurance
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
coverages uh if uh at the end of the
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
study or if this bill was to be put into
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
law could ask one fult so it sounds like
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
there's maybe two things actu one is
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
what the impact on like rates and
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
premiums would be and the other one
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
would somehow be trying to estimate
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is sufficient
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
whether what what a sufficient I guess
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get it is is there a
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
way to do a study to see what would be
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
the right or sufficient uh you know um
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
place to set this well I'm not an
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
actuary and I'm not a lawyer so I'll
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
start there um but I do believe that a
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
study would give us the background
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
information um Actuarial are super smart
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire insurance
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
department has an excellent one right on
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
staff so I believe that having a study
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
would give the information that uh that
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
you as legislators could use to
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether the Caps are
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient as they are now if they
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
should be increased or God forbid if
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this witness
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you thank you
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was just
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing the um the uh settlement
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
compensation list that you attached to
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
your letter and I was just wondering if
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
um you could tell us how much of each of
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
these claims were due to loss of
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
Consortium I can't tell you that uh when
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
I was uh doing some research for my
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
testimony today I was looking for
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
wrongful death uh settlements because
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that is where uh any loss of Consortium
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
claims would be made is through a
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
wrongful death so if there was loss of
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
Consortium and I I would be willing to
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
Guess that there is in these
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
settlements um I don't know to what
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%
degree thank
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
o'conor good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for allowing
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony this morning um I'm here on
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Association
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
for justice uh testifying in support of
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um I am with the firm of
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
Shaheen and Gordon and I've practicing
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
in the area of workers compensation on
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff side for 20 years it's
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
basically the sole focus of my practice
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
and so my testimony this morning will be
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
brief uh and will'll address a very
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
limited narrow issue which is I have
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
heard concerns or it intimated or argued
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh passage of this bill will
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of employers workers
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
compensation insurance premiums and I'm
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
just here to testify that that will not
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
and cannot happen and I want to briefly
 
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.030 align:start position:0%
and cannot happen and I want to briefly
explain

01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
why the the entire point of workers
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
compensation the reason it was initially
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
passed 100 years ago and has been
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
existence for that long is to remove the
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
employees right to sue their employer
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
for negligence so if an employee dies on
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
the job due to some risk of their
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
employment they cannot bring a wrongful
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
death claim against their employer under
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
current law which means by definition
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
their spouse cannot bring an
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
accompanying loss of Consortium claim um
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see this in our workers
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
compensation statute under Section 281
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
A8 if you'll forgive me a brief dramatic
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
reading of the statute what it says is
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
is that an employee of an employer
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
subject to this chapter shall be
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
conclusively presumed to have accepted
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the chapter and on
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the employee or the employees
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
personal or legal representatives to
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
have waved All rights of action whether
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
at common law or by Statute or provided
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
under the laws of any other state or
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise against the employer or the
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
employer's insurance carrier so that's
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
very broad it's deliberately Broad and
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's what's described as the workers's
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
compensation bar it means that as an
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
employee you cannot bring a claim so by
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
definition that is already the state of
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
the law so an adjustment upwards to the
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
arbitrary cap that currently exists on
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
loss of Consortium Claims can have no
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
effect uh on an employer's workers
 
01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.830 align:start position:0%
effect uh on an employer's workers
compensation

01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
premiums that's that's really all I
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to say I'm happy to take any
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
questions sorry thank you questions for
 
01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.070 align:start position:0%
questions sorry thank you questions for
this

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%

01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you next I'm going to call on
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
Keith Nyan Deputy Commissioner of uh

department thank you Mr chairman members
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I appreciate the

opportunity to speak today um there are
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
many experts behind me who I know wish
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
to speak so I'll try to keep my
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
testimony short I will kick this off
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
however by saying without question
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
premiums will increase in the state of
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if this bill passes um I'm
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
also joined here by my colleague James
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
Fox who is our director of Property and
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
Casualty Insurance and our expert
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
actuary that miss pel referen is also
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
here should the need come up to ask a
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
question um we're currently dealing with
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
a kind of a perfect storm of events in
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
impacting insurance premiums in the
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um it was
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier that catastrophic
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
weather events are a driver that is by
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
far one of the biggest we also see
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
increases in the cost of of repairs
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
whether it be to Property and Casualty
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance like automobile insurance or
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance uh there are
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
litigation costs that always affect
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
premium rates um in addition there are
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
supply chain shortages so there are many
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
different events taking place right now
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
within the industry that are driving
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
premiums up we know right now 2024 is
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
projected to have um all-time highs in
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance premiums um what
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
does this mean so really the industry is
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
not in a position to absorb yet more
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
premium increases
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
um we can certainly talk about the
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
reinsurance markets but that's going to
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
be a more drawn out uh discussion again
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
we do know that litigation costs are one
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the many factors that do drive up um
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
premiums we just heard from the prior
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
speaker that workers
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
compensation um premiums would not be
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
affected well there are many other types
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
of insurance as I already alluded to
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
that would be affected whether it be
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance automobile
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
insurance um commercial liability
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice insurance any type
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
of liability insurance um will be
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
subject to increase premium pressure if
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
this uh law passes um I want to clude by
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
saying in the aggregate the markets are
 
01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.629 align:start position:0%
saying in the aggregate the markets are
under

01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
stress we really do not want to be
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
subjecting Insurance consumers in New
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more stress one of the biggest
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
roadblocks to to care is cost of
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
premiums so even as it relates to
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
medical insurance um increasing those
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
premiums is what's going to make things
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult for our consumers I'm
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
going to leave it at that and let the
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
experts behind me um provide their
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'm happy to answer your
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um I I hear
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about all these
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
upward pressures um could you tell I
 
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
kind of was a little confused by the
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone else could explain it
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
but I had a question and that had to do
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
with uh insurance company profits
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
um from what I have as a lay person seen
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
um uh s there's certainly some insurance
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
companies that will be in trouble we
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
know that but the from what I've seen
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
ter the largest insurance companies
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
their profits have increased um
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
measurably and uh one wonders how you
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
can equate
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
that with what you're you know seem to
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
be indicating of increase in demand I'm
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
which thank you for your question
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative I think really what we're
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
touching upon is the formula by which
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
companies are going to um calculate
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
their profit margins it also plays into
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
the reinsurance markets when an
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
insurance company decides to write
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
insurance in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
there's a formula by which they've
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
determined they expect to make X doll
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
profit across their block of
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
business when the company then begins to
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
calculate you know each year there's
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to be different well usually
 
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
yearly might be by by annually determine
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
what those rates are going to be they're
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to start off by determining what
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that profit margin is going to be and
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
then they're going to start backing into
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
that as how they're going to make their
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
profit which is going to be through
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
premium increases so if the company
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
determines through catastrophic losses
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
where their their claim payments are
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
going up if through litigation their
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
claim payments are going up the
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
adjustment by which companies will hit
 
01:48:39.629 --> 01:48:39.639 align:start position:0%
their profit goals will be by increasing
 
01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:41.830 align:start position:0%
their profit goals will be by increasing
those

01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
premiums follow thank you
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
um in other words we didn't invent the
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
capitalist system but we just live by
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
the rules um can can you tell me what
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and and please understand that
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
I don't put myself forward as and you're
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
all the experts I'm not it's it is an
 
01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.310 align:start position:0%
all the experts I'm not it's it is an
innocent

01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to let Mr Fox answer
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
that question it's essentially
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
self-insurance isn't the type of
 
01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
insurance that we're speaking about here
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
but I'll let Mr Fox opine on that thank
 
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.550 align:start position:0%
but I'll let Mr Fox opine on that thank
you

01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
I would also just say on your first
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
question you know the one of the issues
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with is is a hard market
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
and um what that really means is you
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
either your insurance is going to be
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
more expensive to get or you won't be
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
able to get it or if you are able to get
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
it you're going to move out of the
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
admitted Market which is all the
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that we've all heard
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
of into the Surplus lines Market or the
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
alien market so there's there's like a
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
quality U kind of um uh degrades as the
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
types of insurance you can get uh and
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
then one of the other ises that that I
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
know that we had mentioned the uh C
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic losses for California
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
Florida really that's the reinsurance so
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
when you're an insurance company um your
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
willingness to insure anyone is also uh
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
contingent upon your ability to buy
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover those losses so no
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Frontline insurer like if you think of
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
it your auto like aik cut like actually
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
absorbs all those potential risks they
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
sell that off to reinsurance companies
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
which are more International but those
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
reinsurance companies have kind of
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
seeded and are much more likely not to
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
take on things that they view are risky
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
or and and risky for them is that there
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
could be a loss there could be many
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
losses or if we do have losses it's
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to be very expensive so that's
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
what we mean by a hard market and we're
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
squarely in a hard market now so that's
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
a major concern for the Department um
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
the self- insurance issue is so when we
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
say in Self Insurance in New Hampshire
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
some other states they have Self
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's actually like by
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
Statute this is what you need to be
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
self-insured New Hampshire because you
 
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
know this way the New Hampshire is the
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
way uh that just means we don't have
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
insurance so we cely can't speak to how
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
this would be handled by people who
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance whether they would
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
buy insurance or and decide not to be
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
self-insured but obviously um if it's
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
pretty intuitive if if the exposure goes
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
up you're going to have more losses and
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost you more money uh to
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
cover those losses whether you're an
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company in a hard Market or uh
 
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
insurance company in a hard Market or uh
a

01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
self-insured I I do have to just ask
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
what is alien
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
uh well that that would be like Lloyds
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
of London so they're from like would
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
Lloyds of London think it a compliment
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be referred to as alien it's just
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's just how it is it's just how it is
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
in the industry no they don't they're
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
not they're not offended by it all right
 
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah yes representative foran
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm trying to figure out
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
where the you're we're you're saying
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about raising the
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
cap on this particular type of Damages
 
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
and the downside of it is that insurance
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
premiums would come up but the
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
counterargument is well but the
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
value but the people who are injured
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
will get more damages so like the value
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the of having be able to corre his
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
damages increases so where's the where's
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
the tradeoff between um keeping the
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
premiums low and then on the other hand
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
raising the value of the insurance I
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
mean obvious um I guess one danger is if
 
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:19.639 align:start position:0%
we raise it too high people won't buy
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
insurance and then when they cause those
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
damages they'll go bankrupt or take some
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
other actions to avoid paying paying the
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
claim at all since is we are actually
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
collecting this from the uh from the
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
defendant not actually from their
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company but I'm not sure if I
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
made myself clear but we're Ser of the
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
tradeoff between having sufficiently
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
high levels of Damages a compensa for
 
01:52:45.149 --> 01:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
loss versus raising the cost of
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
insurance I mean obviously if we lowered
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
this to zero
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums would go down but I
 
01:52:54.069 --> 01:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't think any seriously considering
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
going going that way so representative
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the question I I
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
will try to do my my Best by saying you
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
know the basic premise of insurance is
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
that the premiums of the many pay the
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
claims of a few so in this particular
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
case you're talking about a fairly High
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
catastrophic loss in term of litigation
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
which could be as proposed upward of
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
$500,000 or if we move the cap you know
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
Limitless where now you're spreading
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
that loss over many many people so it's
 
01:53:22.159 --> 01:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
that loss over many many people so it's
really

01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
how much do we want to impact the
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayer to pay for that
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
isolated loss of
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
one okay I think understands and also
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
follow I guess as an Prim Insurance your
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
mission is also not just to um is also
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
not just to in uh represent the uh
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but also like the
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
people who need insurance I.E the
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
regular people who need to be insured in
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
case they cause these damages is that
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct sir the most
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
important goal of the department is
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and making sure that
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
people can afford those coverage is is
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
is is is by far our number one goal as
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
far as a
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
consumer thank you sir other questions
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative M thank you for
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion in comparison to some
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the other states that did raise the
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
rate of compensation for families or
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
injured or anybody um placing some sort
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
of claim
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
what would you think that the percentage
 
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.550 align:start position:0%
what would you think that the percentage
would

01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
be that people in New Hampshire's
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
insurance would raise what's the
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
percentage that you anticipate based on
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing uh
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative if I understand your
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
question you are you estimating what
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
be the percentage that you anticipate
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion of that what what
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
what would what do you see the
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
percentage rate being raised in this
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
state for you know um Insurance Casualty
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
Insurance or liability insurance for
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state what's the
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
percentage that it would go up for an
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
individual certainly it's a two-part
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
answer and I'm going to give I'm sorry
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good question with probably a
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
three-part answer um first and foremost
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
we already talked about that premiums
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
are going up in New Hampshire my
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
recollection from our um recent property
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty Symposium was
 
01:55:22.109 --> 01:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 to 20% premiums are going to
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
be going up in the home insurance uh
 
01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
Market um additional to that there was
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New York there was a
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
similar Bill not identical that had been
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
passed that that spoke to increasing
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
litigation limits and that resulted in
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
11% premium increase um I guess opining
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
on that that it's not a direct one toone
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
correlation um we could cut that in half
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and say let's assume that this
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
litigation would go up by 5% that would
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
be I'm sorry the premiums would go up by
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
5% % you know that's 5% on top of you
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
know 10 to 20% it really speaks to um
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
third part of the response is what Miss
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
peo had mentioned which is these limits
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
are being selected or otherwise you know
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
proposed to be eliminated without any
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
real Actuarial analysis being done and
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
certainly the department is all in favor
 
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
of um taking time using our Actuarial
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
resources and Industry resources to
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
calculate what that premium impact would
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
be um and that's going to need to be
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
done on multiple lines of business not
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
just homeowners not just auto insurance
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
but the various liability insurance
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
coverages whether it be medical
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
malpractice commercial liability Etc we
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
just don't have that data to give you
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
the specific answer that I think you
 
01:56:39.629 --> 01:56:39.639 align:start position:0%
that that you
 
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
deserve thank
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
you I would just add that there's also
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
the issue we keep saying how how much
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
premium is going to go up there you know
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
as stated I think by Joan pasio that
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner testified at the
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
last hearing on this you know we're only
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
.4% of the market and insurance
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
companies don't need to be in New
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if it gets too um if you
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
become too unattractive for them their
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
choice also can be just to leave the
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and and in some
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh lines of business we only have you
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
know one carrier now or two carriers so
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
it isn't like uh in Auto it's a very
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
rich market and homeowners is very rich
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
but there's other markets that are much
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
less attractive uh that we don't have a
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
large number of carriers
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
handling representative representative
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
Smith and representative trip thank you
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
very much I might have misheard here I
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
am I might have misheard you I thought
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
know what those figures
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
are why don't you why don't I mean you
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful actuar why don't you
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
know what those figures are why haven't
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
you set out to find that thank you
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative essentially doing the
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
type of analysis that we're speaking of
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
takes time it cannot be done you know
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
when when the department does a fiscal
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
note it really talks about the impact of
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
that particular um bill on the financial
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
position of the insurance department of
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
the state um the impact that we're
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
talking on an industry level takes time
 
01:58:08.109 --> 01:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
certainly more than what's been allotted
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
um in in the normal legislative process
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for the answer and I know
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
that when you know of course the way the
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department is funded differs
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
from the way many other departments of
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
funding but this bill was probably
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
filed 8 months ago maybe more I don't
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
know um and so it's no
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
surprise to the department and if you
 
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
really want to know the answer and if
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
you have this wonderful
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
answer I would just say I'm also the
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
head of the market conduct unit so this
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be um it isn't like we just
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
have the information currently at the
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
department uh this would be part of
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
Market conduct um investigation or
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
examination to gather sufficient
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
information on on a pretty broad topic
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then have Christian who's here with
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
us our act try to then determine what
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
that exactly means and because of the
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
situation where we hear that there's a
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
lot of unknowns and variables uh it's a
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
very complicated process to come up with
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
an answer to that question uh and uh
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
also just say that nobody asked us well
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not going to belabor it I
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what you said but by
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
saying nobody asks you if I
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
knew the answers to all the um the
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
questions that are presented to any
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department we wouldn't need executive
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
branch of the government we would just
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
settle it all right here the most of
 
01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
these challenges are serious and they're
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
hard to know the the answers and the
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
fact that it's hard to do I would think
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
that that's what you're supposed to do
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
wrong representative I feel as though
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know whatever statement I make isn't
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to be satisfy you you know we can
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
talk about resource issues and
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
priorities you know relative to all the
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
insurance markets that we regulate I
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
really wish we had that answer for you
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
today we don't we're happy to get it for
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
you it's just going to take the time
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
that that we have not invested yet but I
 
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the question I I thank you
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much and it is it is
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
not uh I don't think it's quite
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
Justified for you to think that I would
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
never be happy with an answer I'm happy
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
with any answer that you give which is
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
the best that you could give and that's
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
what I expect thank you thank you
 
02:00:52.119 --> 02:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
what I expect thank you thank you
representative

02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh it's it safe to
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
assume that uh uh a wrongful death uh
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
award for a a loss of Consortium is is
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
usually a component within a
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
policy it's you don't sell uh wrongful
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
death uh policies do you
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
yes that is currently contemplated in
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
premiums all right so since
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh other people that have testified has
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
said that uh the New Hampshire
 
02:01:35.239 --> 02:01:36.990 align:start position:0%
said that uh the New Hampshire
awards

02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
awards
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
are lower than any other state in the
 
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
region I would assume that uh the since
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
the wrongful death awards are part of a
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive policy that uh that
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
policy rates are lower than those other
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
states is that
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
true that's logical to believe yes
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
sir it's logical to believe but is is is
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
it true or not so representative I would
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
say knowing that there are many many
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
factors going into premium
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
setting I don't know what that
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
particular variable is we can ask Mr
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
cell to join us um I don't have that
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
exact figure but
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
for wrongful death loss of Consortium
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
claims is X and all of the other states
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
around us have no limits or increased
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
limits logic I'm not the the
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
mathematician here would certainly
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
suggest that that particular variable
 
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
yes is higher in setting premiums in
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
those other
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
states would you'd like to add something
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
Christian please
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
I think that that answers the that
 
02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:56.679 align:start position:0%
question there absolutely there many one
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
more followup yes please go ahead the uh
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
CHR not I have to
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh that well my training thought
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
sorry other questions for this W
 
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:10.830 align:start position:0%
sorry other questions for this W
representative

02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thanks um thanks for taking the
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
question um so I've asked several
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
witnesses about Actuarial studies and
 
02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
the various ways that they're being sort
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
of proposed here um and it sounds like
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
you all have the wherewithal internally
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
to do Actuarial studies on this question
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
I guess sort of the two-part question is
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
um do you need any sort of legislative
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
authority to move forward with any of
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
that or or to promote that concept of
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
being done and let me ask both of them
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
time is the purpose of an Actuarial
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
study just to estimate the degree to
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
which premiums would go up at different
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
cap levels or is there an Actuarial
 
02:03:59.470 --> 02:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
approach to look at what the right sort
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
be no please thank you hi I'm Christian
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
Cella I'm Chief Property and Casualty
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
actuary at the New Hampshire insurance
 
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
department um Actuarial studies
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
are challenging um
 
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
um the the first Big Challenge in in
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
trying to tackle such a such a study
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be getting the data all of the
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
work that I would do and I would need to
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
get help outside of our department um
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
would be to get information to get data
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
um and and that's kind of one of the
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
problems that we're dealing with in this
 
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:43.719 align:start position:0%
situation is that we just have it it is
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
very hard to know how the effects would
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
play out if these um caps are raised or
 
02:04:51.119 --> 02:04:52.830 align:start position:0%
play out if these um caps are raised or
eliminated

02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
02:04:57.069 --> 02:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
and and as I mentioned having data is is
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
is the beginning of the study and as
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there there was a
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
question as to how many claims how many
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
cases are out there either currently or
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
in recent history that had a loss of
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
Consortium component and we don't have
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
that number and so the question is well
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
who has that
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
number insurance carriers might have
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
that number if loss of Consortium is
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned in a
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
settlement um of course jury verdicts
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
would have that number but as mentioned
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
we don't even know how many cases are
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
currently working their way through the
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
courts and
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
so long
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
answer for I would love to do a study
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to do a study but I I can't
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
yet begin a study without data and
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge follow up yeah
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
thanks um so just sort of following on
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
that logic because we've heard a lot
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
about the idea that we'd like to do a
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
study and that we maybe could but it
 
02:05:57.069 --> 02:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
does sound
 
02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
like the data Maybe is sort of the the
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
problem um so I guess fundamentally is
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of a red herring the idea of
 
02:06:10.109 --> 02:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
doing an Actuarial study or or would it
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
would it provide value and I I guess one
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
thing I'm thinking is we've heard that
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know the non um uh death version of
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
of the same uh liability doesn't have a
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
cap and other states have raised their
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
caps incrementally do we have reference
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
points that we could that you could use
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
to to do this so I'm really trying to
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
get at the feasibility is this something
 
02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
we should be pursuing as a as a concept
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
02:06:43.870 --> 02:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
would yes represent I think you know the
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
shorter is there there are reference
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
points um New Hampshire insurance
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
department is part of the National
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
Association of Insurance Commissioners
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
which is as the association name suggest
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
all 50 states plus territories are part
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
of this coalition to look at laws and
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
rules impacting all all jurisdictions we
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
can reach out to our counterparts
 
02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
through the National Association and
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
find some of those Benchmark reference
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
points that you referred to um
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
additionally yes we do have um the
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
authority to initiate that analysis that
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of um would certainly
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
create additional work for Mr citarella
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
but that's part of what we do I don't we
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
don't need any special mandate from this
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee other than to you know allow
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
us the time to do that study we would
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
certainly look at the impact on premiums
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
we would leverage our industry Partners
 
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
in that analysis it might be a fairly
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
complex data request where we send out
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
inquiries to every one of our licensed
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
entities asking for various data points
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then the second part of your
 
02:07:51.119 --> 02:07:52.189 align:start position:0%
and then the second part of your
question

02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
was in addition to the impact on premium
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
I believe you asked
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
um is it relevant is it appropriate and
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
then and I'm not wording that properly
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
but there was a second half of your
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
question that you would like addressed
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
analysis yeah I think the distinction I
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
had asked about was between estimating
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
the impact on premiums versus Can you
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
estimate sort of what a a a proper level
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
for a cap could be for something as
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
amorphus says as loss of Consortium I
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
think once representative once the
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
analysis is done then I think
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
collectively all of us in this room
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
would be in a better position to
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
estimate what the appropriate cap would
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
be and that's where we get into that
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
deliberative process working with
 
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
industry working with interested parties
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
to say what is that cap number is it is
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
it status quo is it you know twice as
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
much what it is now I think would have
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
with that data we would be able to make
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
yep follow up go ahead sorry one more
 
02:08:56.669 --> 02:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
followup just um it sounds like what
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is that this not move
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
forward at the moment but could move
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
forward in a future date with more
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
information do you have a sense of what
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
the time that it would take to to get
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
that information would actually
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
be Christian any idea I apologize you
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
know um it's easy for me to say three
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
months but I'm going to get slapped or
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
kicked under the table so any idea what
 
02:09:23.229 --> 02:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
I I can say what the analysis part would
 
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
take you know um yep I mean as mentioned
 
02:09:32.669 --> 02:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
the difficult part would be getting the
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
information and we would need to work
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
with as as the Deputy Commissioner
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned we would have to work with our
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
industry Partners to get that
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
information we would look for
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
cooperation from The Trial Lawyers
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
um let's put it this way once we get the
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
information 90 days I think would be
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
ample to do the actual Actuarial work
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable that's a very good question
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative testerman you had a
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
question wa okay any any other questions
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
so I guess I oh I'm sorry represent
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
ahead what do you need from
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
us to I mean I I wish the commissioner
 
02:10:19.149 --> 02:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
were here I haven't seen him in a while
 
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
nice to see him um
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
what do you need from
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
us for the commissioner and the rest of
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
you in the
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
department to
 
02:10:37.709 --> 02:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
work time representative you know it's
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
really the the Mandate of yes we value
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
your input please take the time come
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
back to us we can set a time period
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
whether it be 3 months or 6 months um
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
and ask us to come back with the numbers
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
request so it would I hate to say the
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
word mandate but authorization or
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
direction to move in that to move in
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
that direction for you I I I appreciate
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
your CER it makes me sad because I would
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
have hoped that you would do this on
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
your own but I think what I hear you
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
saying is unless we
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature directs you to do
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
this um it would not necessarily find a
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
place on your to-do
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
list thank you for the question I guess
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
at the risk of saying probably a little
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
bit too much um most state agencies like
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
most businesses deal with resource
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
issues Mr cell is very busy um we
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
recently have made we we are filling out
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
our ranks of actuaries so we will have
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
more resources next next month month
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
after to assist in that it it's resourc
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
driven and we need
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
to direct Mr citarella where to to to
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
put his efforts and this will certainly
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
help us prioritize this matter over
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
other things that we could be working on
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
could may I also risk but but if we were
 
02:12:18.549 --> 02:12:18.559 align:start position:0%
to do that does that then mean that we
 
02:12:21.629 --> 02:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
are displacing
 
02:12:21.639 --> 02:12:23.270 align:start position:0%
are displacing
other

02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
work that you would left to your own
 
02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
devices considered to be more important
 
02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
devices considered to be more important
than

02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
this I again I'm G to risk uh saying too
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
much but maybe the commissioner might
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
um ultimately this is a policy decision
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
made by the legislature as to caps on
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.069 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
department has a
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
position right now that
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
says right now at this point in time
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pressure you've heard
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
it again a lot of pressure upward
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
pressure on premiums it is a hard Market
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
in most lines of business certainly
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
commercial liability coverage whether
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
that be professional liability coverage
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
products liability coverage other
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
liability general liability coverage in
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
the commercial this is going to affect
 
02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
those lines most most notably and I
 
02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
those lines most most notably and I
think

02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
intuitively so if there is if there is
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
concern as to how that is going to
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
affect and try to make a a a a
 
02:13:38.239 --> 02:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
affect and try to make a a a a
quantitative

02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
quantitative
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
estimate if I were to do that I would
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
need information in order to feel
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable making put a number on it um
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
I think I and I speak for think I speak
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner for the Department
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
where we kind of hoped it didn't it it
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
it might not it wouldn't have to come to
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that that there might
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
be um a reasonable compromise at some
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
smaller you
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
know cap temporary or time limited cap
 
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
so that the hard Market might
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
dissipate um if there is and if there is
 
02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.189 align:start position:0%
dissipate um if there is and if there is
a

02:14:18.189 --> 02:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:14:20.109 --> 02:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislative question like from the
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
hearing from a legis
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier for us it's not
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
necessary as the deputy mentioned but it
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for us to then go to
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
carriers and say hey we need your help I
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
need this information we have a you know
 
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that's pending we have
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
legislators that are waiting for this
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
answer we need cooperation I need I need
 
02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
answer we need cooperation I need I need
the

02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
data that would move things along um
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
long answer
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
um many different variables you know in
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
play but you know six months from now it
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be easier to have a number for
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
you other questions for the yes
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you thank you
 
02:15:08.669 --> 02:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions um we heard
 
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
earlier today that about 90% of cases
 
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
are settled um without um I can't
 
02:15:17.709 --> 02:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
remember whether it was prior to filing
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
suit or or before trial but 90% of cases
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
settle um and one could anticipate or
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
surmise that there are non-disclosure
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
agreements or um confidentiality
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
agreements and those kinds of
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
settlements and I'm wondering
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
whether uh assuming that's true whether
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
that would impact your ability to get
 
02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
the data that you need to then do the
 
02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:47.030 align:start position:0%
the data that you need to then do the
Actuarial

02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
Actuarial
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
analysis it's an excellent question I
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe it would those
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
confidentiality Agreements are certainly
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
specific to the parties involved I
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
believe we can actually request the data
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
in in unidentifiable format so that we
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
can get the genericized data if you will
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
I believe we can answer that for
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative Perez I apologize I was
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
late so you may have answered this it's
 
02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
my understanding that many states have
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
this uh and they have much higher limits
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
than we have presently in New Hampshire
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
because ours are quite low I think on
 
02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
the very very low and they haven't been
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
changed I believe since
 
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
1997 so how are other states handling
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
this when they have them up to a million
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
bills can you put on
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
premiums I think it's intuitive that it
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
affects premium how different insurance
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
companies approach that is handled
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
differently by different insurance
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
companies some insurance comp companies
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
may very well say hey there is a new new
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
law new cap we've worked under this
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
prior cap and with that assumption when
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
we set our rates last year this new year
 
02:17:04.439 --> 02:17:05.429 align:start position:0%
we set our rates last year this new year
new

02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
caps we're going to change our rates and
 
02:17:10.509 --> 02:17:10.519 align:start position:0%
premiums accordingly some insurance
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
companies will handle it differently
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
some insurance companies will say okay
 
02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
let's wait to see how it affects
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
settlements how it you know whether more
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
more claims go to a jury um and then in
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
three to five years we'll see how our
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
experience plays out and then we'll
 
02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:28.599 align:start position:0%
adjust premiums at that time insurance
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
carriers are are afforded that ability
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
to handle that situation as as they deem
 
02:17:40.509 --> 02:17:40.519 align:start position:0%
fit and it would be reasonable to to
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
believe that some might change their
 
02:17:42.559 --> 02:17:44.110 align:start position:0%
believe that some might change their
rates

02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
immediately yes so you don't have um uh
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
any idea or you haven't done any looking
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
into and saying so this state went up
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
and their rate this state increased
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
theirs and this is a very modest
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
compared to other states I understand
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
how much their rates went up so we don't
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
know you know oh the rates went up by
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
50% so you don't have any of that data
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
um no and that would be difficult to
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
ascertain just because there are many
 
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
many factors that go in into a a raate
 
02:18:24.509 --> 02:18:24.519 align:start position:0%
filing that you know may result in an
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
increase you know the situation in Maine
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
it was somewhat gradual you know it
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
appeared as if that there were step
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
increases every few years and that the
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
most recent one went from 750 to a
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars at that
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
level you're you're going to it it would
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
not be surprising to see less of an
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
effect than it would be to you know in
 
02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
this case more than triple the
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
cap I at least that's that's an that
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's that would not be a surprise that
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
there would be less of an impact or an
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
immediate impact in in that situation
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions for this witness
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes I just have one question it's
 
02:19:12.669 --> 02:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
my my perception and correct me if I'm
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
wrong that
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
this we're arguing over what is
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
generally a a relatively I mean it seems
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
like we're arguing over the tail rather
 
02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
than the dog in the sense that the
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's no cap on the on the wrongful
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
death claim itself right and typically I
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
would think the that will
 
02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
be the
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
Big Driver of the amount of of a verdict
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
or settlement and the and the loss of
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
Consortium would be a relatively smaller
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
percent of that and so just
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
wondering um I mean is that is that
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
generally true that you know we're we're
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
arguing over something that is is a
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
really uh relatively small percentage of
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
the of most damage claims sir I think
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
you said that quite well okay that that
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes that is the bigger issue without
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
question you know really when when our
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
testimony is really to indicate that yes
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
premiums would go up and I
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
believe and there's individuals behind
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
me who can give you data that the
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
essence of your point is spot on that
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
the the wrongful death claim is
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
certainly going to far exceed the loss
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
of Consortium component of any
 
02:20:44.590 --> 02:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
settlement other questions thank you
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
very much see none thank you thank you
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
folks uh I see Mr Fox I you signed a
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
card and I I appreciate that is there
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
anything else that you want okay no
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you right uh Marissa
 
02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:15.670 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you right uh Marissa
Chase

02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon m u Mr chair
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak to for the
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Marissa Chase I'm the
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
executive director for the New Hampshire
 
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
Association for justice which is a
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide Professional Association of
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
trial attorneys what I just submitted I
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
left I had left over in my backpack from
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing from one of our
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
members who um had a very tragic um case
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
um involving a loss of Consortium claims
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
so I thought while I had it and he went
 
02:21:43.630 --> 02:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
through the trouble to print it out on
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
fancy paper I would give it to you all
 
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to address a few points
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I want to Echo everything that Holly
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
Haynes had said earlier and for those of
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
you that were not able to um be here for
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
her testimony I I hope that you will go
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
back and watch um her presentation I
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
think those of you who are here will
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
agree that it was quite compelling and
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
illustrative of how these claims work
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
um we have spent so much time on this
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
one piece of legislation that is in my
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
mind just an issue of fundamental
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
fairness you have the situation where um
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
a defendant would rather see a dead
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
plaintiff than a catastrophically
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
injured one why are those two scenarios
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
treated so differently if you
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
effectively lose your spouse and
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of their life versus if they
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
are actually deceased um and that's what
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to remedy I do think
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation would not have any sea
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
change of impact on how litigation works
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
even if the cap were completely
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated but knowing that there were a
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns out there the felt more
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with trying to come to a
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
lower number and trying to get all the
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
parties together we were very willing to
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate and
 
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I will not speak for anyone
 
02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
um I will not speak for anyone
else

02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
um again I just want to reiterate this
 
02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
is the only cap that exists in any
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
elements of these
 
02:23:16.269 --> 02:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
claims and as someone noted earlier the
 
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
claim for loss of Consortium in a
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
wrongful death case would hope be few
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
and far between because hopefully there
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
aren't many um instances every year of
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
people getting killed by the negligence
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
of someone else and having a viable loss
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
of Consortium claim as a derivative of
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
that underlying claim again this is a
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
derivative claim so if the policy limit
 
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
against the defendant is maxed out by
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
the underlying negligence claim there is
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
no claim for loss of Consortium this is
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
not this is not a big deal um two other
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to say um I actually do
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
have data from other states and I sent
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
it to you all um you know in in Illinois
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
when they raised and then eliminated
 
02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:01.550 align:start position:0%
when they raised and then eliminated
their

02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
caps liability insurance rates actually
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
decreased over the next
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
decade in Maine they just when they
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
incrementally increased their caps and
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
now it's at a million dollars did a
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
comparison with the rest of the market
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
that is in your inboxes as well stayed
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
generally the same um litigate it's my
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
understanding and I'm not an actuary and
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
I don't represent an insurance company
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
but what happens in litigation does not
 
02:24:29.389 --> 02:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
I want to be careful about this word
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
does not drive the insurance Market I
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
also know that there is this talk about
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
a hardening Market that issue has been
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
raised by the insurance industry since
 
02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.230 align:start position:0%
raised by the insurance industry since
about

02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
2019 um yet at the same time as
 
02:24:44.429 --> 02:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
representative Smith noted earlier the
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
profits that insurance companies are
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
making across the country today have
 
02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
making across the country today have
increased

02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
exponentially so I don't know where the
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
need to raise premiums necessarily comes
 
02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:58.510 align:start position:0%
need to raise premiums necessarily comes
from

02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:25:01.469 --> 02:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
um two other points I wanted to make um
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
again um when this was instituted over
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
the um over 1997 1998 um when this
 
02:25:10.030 --> 02:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
became a cause of action 25 years ago I
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
was in first grade and we haven't even
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
looked at those caps
 
02:25:13.279 --> 02:25:15.070 align:start position:0%
looked at those caps
since

02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
um um representative Manos had asked
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
about the number of these cases that
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
exist per year um
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a wrongful death
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
action it was it's my understanding from
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
our members behind me that in order to
 
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
open up in a state to file a wrongful
 
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
death action you must file a rule eight
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
Motion in Probate Court and
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn please correct me
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
one I'm wrong um so I asked the
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the Courts for
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
that number of how many rule eight
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
motions were filed on an annual basis to
 
02:25:45.389 --> 02:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
try to get some sense of how many
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
wrongful death claims even exist that
 
02:25:49.469 --> 02:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
would not include loss of consortion but
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
just give the large larest possible
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
number and they indicated they do not
 
02:25:54.429 --> 02:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
keep track of that information so I'm
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have that for you um in
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
terms of um representative lonza earlier
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
you asked about Runaway Jury verdicts
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
our organization has a list serve um
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
that acts as a tool for all of our
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
members to ask each other questions it's
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
especially helpful for smaller law
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
firms a couple weeks ago our list serve
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
was a buzz because there was the rare
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's verdict in a personal injury
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
claim in Hillsboro South in Nashua um by
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
Dave goddman that verdict was for
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and our members were
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
celebrating that there was even a
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's jury verdict that came out
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
of Hillsboro South we do not have
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits we don't have large
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
Awards and payouts in New Hampshire
 
02:26:42.510 --> 02:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
because we're cheap Yankees
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
um let's see I just want to under make
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure I hit everyone's questions um so we
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
do have the data from other states that
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I think it's kind of an
 
02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
impossible task to predict the future
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
when we don't know how many people are
 
02:26:58.269 --> 02:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
going to be killed by the negligence of
 
02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
others and setting rates but we can look
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
historically at what has happened in
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
other states that went forward with
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
raising or eliminating their caps and
 
02:27:09.070 --> 02:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
those across the board show that rates
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
have either stayed the same or decreased
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
depending on National

02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
um The Grieving families act in New York
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
that was um mentioned a bill that passed
 
02:27:21.469 --> 02:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
in New York was actually vetoed by
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
Governor hokel so I don't know um and
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
that act changed the um statute of limit
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
so it passed through the New York
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislature that in expanded the scope
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
of LW of Consortium claims who could
 
02:27:36.429 --> 02:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
bring them increase the statu of
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
limitations increased the amounts it did
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
a whole lot this bill is absolutely not
 
02:27:45.269 --> 02:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
B this bill changes a number does not
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
change the scope who can bring claims in
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
what time frame they can bring claims
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
and again was vetoed so it has not been
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
enacted so if rates are increasing in
 
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
Maine it's not because of anything to do
 
02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
with loss of
 
02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
with loss of

02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
Consortium
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
um um I also want to say to the point of
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
how much time it's going to take to get
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial information I just looked
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
back through my email and um found notes
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I took from a meeting we had with
 
02:28:13.389 --> 02:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Insurance and some of
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
my members on January 26th so this bill
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
has been around for a while if we needed
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
to gather more data it went from from
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Judiciary Committee there was a
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing it passed the Senate then
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
it was referred to Senate finance and
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
there was an ability to take a look at
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
any fiscal impact there there was no
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
testimony um it passed out of Senate
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
finance and it passed the Senate came to
 
02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
the house and now there's a fiscal note
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
um so we we have had the opportunity
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
over months to look at any real hard
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
data points that we could point to that
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
says that this is going to you know
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
again make the sky fall and I just don't
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
see it so I will end my testimony there
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm happy to answer any
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Kiren Schultz I'm
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
here with my with my colleague Jim hadam
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're both attorneys uh with Nix and
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
peepy um we're here representing
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
presenting State Farm which is one of
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
the leading writers of auto and home
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
insurance in the nation and here in New
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're here in opposition
 
02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
to SB
 
02:30:03.630 --> 02:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
462 the reasons for our opposition of
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
the bill largely track uh what you've
 
02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
heard already as far as concerns from
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
other insurance IND industry
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and what you're what you
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
will hear from others after us um we've
 
02:30:16.429 --> 02:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
just submitted written testimony for the
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
record and I'll summarize its main
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
points briefly
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
every human life is priceless and the
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
current law in New Hampshire
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately recognizes that our
 
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
current law protects the interests of
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who seek relief through the
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
Civil Justice System after they've lost
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
a loved one a loss which is intangible
 
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.429 align:start position:0%
a loved one a loss which is intangible
non-pecuniary

02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
non-pecuniary
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
um it's it's really an emotional loss
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
and the emotional or amorphous nature of
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
that loss makes quantifying the damages
 
02:30:49.359 --> 02:30:51.389 align:start position:0%
that loss makes quantifying the damages
difficult

02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
our current law also uh you know for all
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the people in New Hampshire who
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
purchase insurance the law protects
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
Market stability and predictability and
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
important so in a wrongful death action
 
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the way it is now um
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
the law allows at deance estate to
 
02:31:15.790 --> 02:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
recover significant categories of both
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
economic and non-economic damages which
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
are not capped
 
02:31:24.349 --> 02:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
these damages flow through the estate to
 
02:31:27.309 --> 02:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
compensate the decedent next of kin the
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries heirs at law without any
 
02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
limitation on the amount of an award and
 
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
the Trier of fact is entrusted
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately with assessing those
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
damages what attributes to consider when
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
an estate seeks compensation for its
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
losses resulting from a decedent's
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
injury and
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
death and then similarly subject to
 
02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable caps New Hampshire law allows
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
damages for wrongful death claims
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
related to the loss of a relationship
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
with the loved one so these lost
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims uh the when when the
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
loss is caused by untimely death due to
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
negligence or other
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct and we believe the current
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire strikes the right
 
02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
balance on this really tough
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
subject um it permits meaningful
 
02:32:20.349 --> 02:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
compensation for family members economic
 
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
and non-economic damages and when you
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
consider the totality of the recoverable
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
damages for wrongful death and lost
 
02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
Consortium and on appropriate facts the
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
surviving family members might also be
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
able to bring claims for example U
 
02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
negligent or intentional infliction of
 
02:32:39.279 --> 02:32:40.590 align:start position:0%
negligent or intentional infliction of
emotional

02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
distress the availability of
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
compensation for these claims puts New
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well within the mainstream
 
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:51.389 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well within the mainstream
nationally

02:32:51.389 --> 02:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:53.710 --> 02:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
um and as we've discussed a little bit
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh questions from Representatives tour
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
and and Manos I believe about um the
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
data that might be available uh how
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
these Actuarial studies might be
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
conducted conducted uh it you know
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
accurate and
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive publicly available data on
 
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
wrongful death Awards is really
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to get um these cases are most
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
often settled the fact of settlement is
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
confidential the am of settlement is
 
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
confidential um and very few of them are
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
actually ever filed in court it seems
 
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
and then even fewer ever make it to a
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
jury uh or a tri of fact or to a
 
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
jury uh or a tri of fact or to a
verdict

02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
verdict
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
um we know that wrongful death claims
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
are relatively low
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
frequency but High severity claims um by
 
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean that wrongful death claims
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
are less common than uh non-death
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
personal injury claims but the wrongful
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
death claims result in substantially
 
02:33:58.750 --> 02:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
payouts and so we believe that
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the Caps as this bill
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
proposes to do uh risks materially
 
02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
impacting insurance rates potentially
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
driving them up even higher uh it also
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
risks driving up the volume of lawsuits
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
and settlements whether meritorious or
 
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
and settlements whether meritorious or
non-meritorious

02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
non-meritorious
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
and it risks striving up the ultimate
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
payouts of resulting Awards by
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
businesses and insurers and for these
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we oppose the bill and I believe
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
um my colleague Jim hayam has some some
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
more data points about um rates if if uh
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
we'd like to present that testimony
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
certainly Mr
 
02:34:42.349 --> 02:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
ha so thank you Mr chair Again Jim hayam
 
02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
representing State Farm for the record
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know I in the Senate heard a
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
lot of questions and concerns about you
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
know if this is going to Impact
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
Insurance rates and premiums paid you
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
know how much is that going to be and we
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
certainly heard that frustration uh from
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
this committee that um you know there
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
information this available uh and but
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
knowing something about how axies
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
operate I Echo what I think you heard
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
earlier about how what a complicated
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
analysis it would be um but I did ask
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
State Farm if they could just give me an
 
02:35:20.750 --> 02:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
estimate for purpose of this hearing as
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
to what they would anticipate their rate
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
increases would be now you need to
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
remember that State Farm is an auto
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
carrier so that's the most important
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
line or it's primarily an auto carrier
 
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
and a homeowner's carrier so we're
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the rate impact for
 
02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
automobile policies in New Hampshire and
 
02:35:42.990 --> 02:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
what State Farm estimate estimates is
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
that an additional 30 to
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
$45 of Premium per automobile policy
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
which is the equivalent of an additional
 
02:35:56.590 --> 02:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
4% of Premium if this bill passes so
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
again I remind you there's you know
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
State Farm is one of a 100 or so maybe
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
more companies that ride in New
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this is just a reflection
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
of what State Farm would do um and but
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
we also need to keep in mind that um you
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
know the impact on other types of
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
commercial lines um liability coverages
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
particularly medical malpractice would
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
likely have a much more dramatic uh
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
impact negative impact on the rates and
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
the premiums charged so I just wanted to
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
add that to this uh discussion and I'm
 
02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on Ann
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman good afternoon
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives um my name is an CI uh I

am with the law firm shardi and bacon

out of their Boston office um and I'm
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
here to testify an opposition of this
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill on behalf of the American tort
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
reform Association which is a
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
broad-based coalition of businesses
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities associations and
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%

02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
promoting greater balance and

02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
apologize to you ahead of time I'm a

fish out of water because my day job is
 
02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a

litigator fair
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
warning my hope today is to provide you
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
um some context for New Hampshire's loss
 
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
of Consortium caps as they pertain to
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
wrongful death claims context which
 
02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully will highlight why the current
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
caps ought to remain in place the
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
current caps keep New Hampshire's law on
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
loss of Consortium recovery in the
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
mainstream as to a broader picture Most
 
02:37:57.150 --> 02:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
states allow for some form of loss of
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
Consortium arising from wrongful death
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh and these might include some or all
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the following uh recovery by a child
 
02:38:08.269 --> 02:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
for the loss of a parent recovery by a
 
02:38:12.670 --> 02:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
parent for loss of a child and spousal
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
Consortium um some states only recognize
 
02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:17.230 align:start position:0%
Consortium um some states only recognize
spousal

02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
spousal
 
02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
Consortium uh and other states don't
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
allow for Recovery of loss of Consortium
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
in any form at all uh in the context of
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
wrongful death New Hampshire allows for
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
all three forms of loss of
 
02:38:33.790 --> 02:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
Consortium what's more of the states who
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
do allow for loss of consor and wrongful
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
death about a dozen only allow for
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
pecuniary Recovery which I believe has
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
come up earlier uh that's to say that
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
these states allow for Recovery as to
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
the amounts that can be certainly or at
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
least Le somewhat reasonably
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
ascertained in other words loss of
 
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
Consortium in these states is limited to
 
02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
economic harm like the loss of the VA
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
the value of the decedent labor for
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
instance as opposed to emotional loss in
 
02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
contrast New Hampshire's loss of
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
Consortium statute allows for subjective
 
02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
recovery like loss of comfort affection
 
02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
guidance companionship and it does with
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
the tradeoff of these caps
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
but perhaps most importantly we ought to
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that loss loss of
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
Consortium the one at issue is
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
derivative of a claim for wrongful death
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
and put plainly recovery for loss of
 
02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
Consortium is in addition to that of the
 
02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
underlying claim for wrongful death and
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
in a decedent estate the party bringing
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
the wrongful death action has the
 
02:39:46.910 --> 02:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
ability to recover for the mental and
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
physical pain and suffering suffered by
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
the decedent which is non-economic the
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
decedent's Lost earning capacity the
 
02:39:57.150 --> 02:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
decedent's probable duration of life but
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
for the injury and reasonable expenses
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
such as medical bills or funeral
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
expenses incurred by the estate on
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
account of the wrongful death but that's
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
not all New Hampshire is one of only a
 
02:40:12.309 --> 02:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
few States I think there are only six
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
that allows for something called honic
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
damages and honic damages are sometimes
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
referred to as loss of enjoyment of Life
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
damages and these esoterically named
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
damages are notably
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
uncapped to be clear currently in no
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
hampsh in New Hampshire there is no
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
limit to the non-economic recovery in a
 
02:40:37.389 --> 02:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
state can seek for a decedent's loss of
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of Life the only limits are
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
those on the loss of Consortium claims
 
02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
ones that are only recoverable in
 
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
addition to the the already uncapped
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
possible recovery for the wrongful death
 
02:40:53.950 --> 02:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
itself so taking a step back to view the
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
statute in its entirety reveals that not
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
only does the legislature not need to
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
raise caps on these derivative claims it
 
02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
should not after all raising these
 
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
claims could run the risk of confusing
 
02:41:08.349 --> 02:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
juries into rewarding duplicative
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
recovery to be clear this is not an
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
indictment on New Hampshire juries this
 
02:41:16.750 --> 02:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
is just the opposite this is a nuanced
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
area of the law one that attorneys
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that's to say that people who for
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason signed up to discuss and
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
argue things like konic damages struggle
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
to make sense of so viewed in the
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
context of the wrongful death statute
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the Caps as they exist make sense in
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
fact we submit that it's the current
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
caps on these damages that helps keep
 
02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the
 
02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
mainstream the current caps are
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable controls on highly subjective
 
02:41:48.030 --> 02:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
damages and as to Total Recovery there
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
appears to be no evidence that
 
02:41:51.309 --> 02:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in New Hampshire are not
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
already getting appropriate Awards
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
indeed a quick review of New Hampshire
 
02:41:57.550 --> 02:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs firm's websites reveal
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
Council boasting about wrongful death
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
settlement Awards some crusting $4
 
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
million and again this is
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
settlement I submit to you that none of
 
02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
my friends across the courtroom would
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
argue that raising caps on these loss of
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims would not cause them
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
to raise their bottom lines at the time
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
of settlement
 
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations for all of these reasons I
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully request the committee
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
reject this bill I thank you very much
 
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'll answer any
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
questions that I can help questions for
 
02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:29.269 align:start position:0%
questions that I can help questions for
this

02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
Forest thank you thanks for taking my
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
question so here's a concern I have okay
 
02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
we have a wrongful death and I file a
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
suit here in New Hampshire and the
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
attorney says well we're going to give
 
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
you 2
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
million um and it's going to cover you
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
know uh loss of wages blah blah blah but
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to get for loss of
 
02:42:54.190 --> 02:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
Consortium then you have to file that
 
02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
bill separately so we don't know how
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
much they actually get for each of the
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
different things we would know that loss
 
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
of wages potential wages would be very
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
documented correct um that type of thing
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
but would those say in them would the
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
settlement saying them and this is
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to have their
 
02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
L run around anymore that's a great
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
question representative um generally
 
02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
settlements um they generally are not
 
02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
divided out like that um settlements I
 
02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
think as others have discussed are
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
usually highly
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
confidential um there are more um for
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term legal jargon
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
Clauses that you would imagine are in
 
02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
there exact so you understand
 
02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives yes there's there's a
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of um legal jargon
 
02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
in these settlement agreements but
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
generally they are not parceled out um
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you're talking about
 
02:43:58.319 --> 02:43:59.309 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you're talking about
in

02:43:59.309 --> 02:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
settlement yep so you're saying that we
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
have no idea if they received any
 
02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
compensation for that particular portion
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
of the list of things that New Hampshire
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
allows I see that's no that's a good
 
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
question so that would be um something
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
that the attorneys would discuss back
 
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the the plaintiff's attorneys
 
02:44:24.750 --> 02:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
advocating for the plaintiff's side will
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
question yeah representative CH yeah
 
02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking the question
 
02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um and maybe I misunderstood I
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify something that I
 
02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
thought you heard earlier I had asked
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
sort of how these damages for loss of
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
Consortium are are generally derived and
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds I was understood that there
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
really is it's just purely subjective
 
02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
based on experience I thought you had
 
02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
said in New Hampshire there are more
 
02:44:57.269 --> 02:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
guidelines around how those are created
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if that was I heard
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
that correctly no I'm sorry if I if I
 
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
said that I misspoke you're correct they
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
are highly subjective the loss of
 
02:45:07.469 --> 02:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
Consortium um the loss of Consortium
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
recovery in New Hampshire uh is much
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
more subjective whereas in certain other
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
states um the statute may say for XYZ
 
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
and nothing else um you can recover in
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for highly subjective
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
things like affection Comfort Etc okay
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
so it's other states that place these
 
02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
these limits on it okay thank you other
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes I have
 
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
one question
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
the why does it make any sense to to
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
sort of follow up on Miss Chase's
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimonial why does it make any sense
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire to say there will be a
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
cap on the limit of Consortium damages
 
02:45:46.710 --> 02:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
in a wrongful death case but if instead
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
of uh Tor feaser killing someone they
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
just you
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
know uh injure him for life in a very
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
significant way but he or she is alive
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no limitation no it's
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question chairman um I
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
here only on on behalf of this specific
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
bill and I realize that there has been
 
02:46:11.269 --> 02:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about um the other but as to
 
02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
as to wrongful death specifically um I
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
think our fear would be double
 
02:46:20.429 --> 02:46:20.439 align:start position:0%
recovery um as as as far as uh loss of
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
Consortium goes on top of the uncapped
 
02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:24.070 align:start position:0%
Consortium goes on top of the uncapped
wrongful

02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
wrongful
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
death right but I mean that same double
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
recovery would exist where somebody
 
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.070 align:start position:0%
recovery would exist where somebody
didn't

02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
die it's very true okay yes chairman
 
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
other yes represent
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
stapled thank you for taking my question
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:43.309 --> 02:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative an example here
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
um a woman dies in an automobile
 
02:46:47.439 --> 02:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
um a woman dies in an automobile
accident

02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
accident
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
not her
 
02:46:53.309 --> 02:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
fault um she is the caregiver to a
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
dementia Alzheimer's person as a result
 
02:46:58.710 --> 02:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
he's got to go
 
02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
into um assisted living or nursing home
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
whatever is that case uh one of wrongful
 
02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
death uh or Consortium or
 
02:47:12.190 --> 02:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
both it's it's a very good question
 
02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative um it of course my my
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer self says it depends on how the
 
02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
complaint reads right so if you were the
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council you can you can lay
 
02:47:27.309 --> 02:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
your claims out as you wish um but uh to
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think to your question is to and as to
 
02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:30.750 align:start position:0%
I think to your question is to and as to
recovery

02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
02:47:33.469 --> 02:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
specifically um you know our our
 
02:47:37.630 --> 02:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
position would be there is a uh a there
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a tall order to ask of juries to
 
02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
parcel out your hypothetical and say
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
okay how would you award the wrongful
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
death how would you award the loss of
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
Consortium um again I think it is it's
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
something that me and my colleagues
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
debate um damages and and the like and
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
it it gets very very nebulous and very
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
very nuanced so it's hard to
 
02:48:07.230 --> 02:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
answer sure thank you other questions
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much thank you
 
02:48:21.790 --> 02:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Ben for the record
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Ben Bradley I'm the vice
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
president of state government
 
02:48:30.190 --> 02:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
Association I hope to provide some
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh our members concerns
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh as part of the broader
 
02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
discussion um the association is opposed
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
to S SP 462 I'm not going to read my
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
whole testimony I will submit it for the
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
record but I would like to make a few
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
points for our Healthcare System system
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
to continue functioning effectively we
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
believe the existing reasonable limits
 
02:48:54.429 --> 02:48:54.439 align:start position:0%
on liability must be sustained and I'll
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
tell you why we acknowledge all victims
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
of medical malpractice should have
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
access to the courts for the
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
compensation they're entitled to under
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
our laws medical liability is a subset
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
of a larger category of Industries
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill things like kids
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
camps other
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
nonprofits businesses anybody is a
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
purchaser of liability insurance I hope
 
02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
my my testimony on behalf of hospitals
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is included in your
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
consideration of the broader scope of
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders this bill
 
02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
effects if s SP 462 is amended by the
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
Senate became law we believe all
 
02:49:33.389 --> 02:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
Insurance buying consumers including but
 
02:49:35.229 --> 02:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
not limited to hospitals and Healthcare
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
Providers would experience higher
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
premiums leading to higher health care
 
02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
costs as noted by the Commissioner of
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
Insurance on several occasions and as
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
noted in the fiscal
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
note increased medical liability will
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
influence where providers decide to
 
02:49:54.190 --> 02:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
practice their chosen specialty and what
 
02:49:57.389 --> 02:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
procedures they're comfortable with
 
02:49:59.710 --> 02:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
performing this upward pressure on
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
medical liability has a chilling effect
 
02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
on providers of high-risk services and
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
most notably we believe obstetric and
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery services although
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
there are contributors many contributors
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the closure of 11 birthing units in
 
02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since 2003 and inability
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
to secure and afford malpractice
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
insurance is a leading driver of their
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
closures just last year the owner of the
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
conquered birthing center indicated
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
publicly that the reason for her closure
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
in July was because of a huge increase
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the price of malpractice insurance
 
02:50:39.150 --> 02:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
additionally just last year the state of
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
Maine as we've heard increased their am
 
02:50:44.429 --> 02:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh wrongful death loss of Consortium
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
claims award
 
02:50:49.710 --> 02:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
caps um in September a month before
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
those caps were due to go into effect
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
York hospital closed their labor and
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
delivery units the fragility of our
 
02:50:59.550 --> 02:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery services in our area
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
could not be more evident than these two
 
02:51:03.630 --> 02:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
examples however there is one additional
 
02:51:05.389 --> 02:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
scenario playing out in our North
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
Country where there is only one labor
 
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
and delivery unit in all of Coos County
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
they are currently well staffed with a
 
02:51:15.550 --> 02:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
team of providers and remain committed
 
02:51:19.790 --> 02:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
to providing access to uh maternal
 
02:51:22.229 --> 02:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
care however their biggest concern
 
02:51:24.229 --> 02:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
threatening access to their care is an
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
increase in medical liability insurance
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
I caution the committee s SP 462 may be
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
well intentioned but could be the straw
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
that breaks the camels back for many
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
Specialties and industries at which time
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
those affected may need taxpayer support
 
02:51:43.950 --> 02:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
to maintain their operations this exact
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
scenario has played out in New York
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
state where from 2003 to 2013
 
02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
malpractice premiums increased by
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
60% to stem the loss of doctors leaving
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
their practice or moving to other
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions New York State enacted
 
02:52:02.229 --> 02:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislation subsidizing the malpractice
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
insurance costs of
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%

02:52:18.269 --> 02:52:18.279 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire Hospital Association

ask you to put a lot of thought towards
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
this before moving it through the

legislature uh and we would ask the
 
02:53:17.790 --> 02:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
committee to move the bill in expedient
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%

02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
Primary Care DMC Primary Care is an
 
02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:52.760 align:start position:0%

patients I'm here today on their behalf
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
and opposition to Senate Bill
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
462 we believe that Senate Bill 462
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
would have the effect of increasing the
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
number of claims against our
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners where they're meritorious
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
or not the potential for increases in
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
claims and litigation would have the
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
effect of increasing our insurance
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
premiums this has a direct cost on our
 
02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
business at a time when access to
 
02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
Primary Care is critical we cannot
 
02:54:53.550 --> 02:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
support a proposal that could negatively
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to deliver primary
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%

02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
our current
 
02:55:05.070 --> 02:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
rates we believe that as you evaluate
 
02:55:07.150 --> 02:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
the potential merits of such a policy
 
02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
change all potential consequences should
 
02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
be evaluated including the consequences
 
02:55:16.349 --> 02:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
for independent Primary Care

02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
we would like to continue to offer
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
robust access to Primary Care at the
 
02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
lowest possible costs we would recommend
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill be inexpedient to legislate
 
02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%

02:55:44.349 --> 02:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
Marston not sure if I pronounced that
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
correctly if I did I if I did not I
 
02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
correctly if I did I if I did not I
apologize

02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.070 --> 02:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
I was way off but that's my fault
 
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
because I was writing in the hallway in
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
the card I'm James Monahan with the I'm
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the New
 
02:55:59.950 --> 02:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties I'll
 
02:56:03.070 --> 02:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
hand in a letter from the association um
 
02:56:06.269 --> 02:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
but to summarize it uh it uh Echoes much
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
of what you've heard from the those who
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
testified today about the upward
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
pressure on rates associated with uh the
 
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
passage of the legislation um in large
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
measure I think the the role we can play
 
02:56:19.309 --> 02:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
here is to remind the committee that uh
 
02:56:21.229 --> 02:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
it is public entities that would be
 
02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by um by these changes as well
 
02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
as the private voices you've heard from
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
today with that I'm I know it's well
 
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
into the hearing I'm happy to answer any
 
02:56:32.990 --> 02:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions you might have or provide
 
02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
additional information if the committee
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
needs it yeah uh representative
 
02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um good
 
02:56:43.910 --> 02:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon M Mr Monahan could you answer
 
02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
a question for me and maybe you can
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're now guess the third person in a
 
02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
row who's you know talked about all this
 
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
upward pressure that you want to try to
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
avoid um if New Hampshire
 
02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
already is so high in terms of how how
 
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
is it worded here let me see um uh the
 
02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
highest cost to Medical
 
02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.870 align:start position:0%
highest cost to Medical
liability

02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
um when
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
and if that exists now under current
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
pressure a current situ why would you
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
say that it's going to go
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
higher if in
 
02:57:36.830 --> 02:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
fact the cap is eliminated or raised
 
02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
when other states have the
 
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
Caps I'm not asking the question clearly
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
am I Mr
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
vahan and I understand that you're a lot
 
02:57:51.229 --> 02:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
SM than I am about it I just don't I
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
mean I see something of the
 
02:57:59.229 --> 02:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
child uh the childhood story book of
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
Henny Penney the sky is
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
falling in these
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
discussions I don't quite get the
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
relationship between what the situation
 
02:58:10.110 --> 02:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
is now and what it would
 
02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
become if we tend to conform to what
 
02:58:15.389 --> 02:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
other states are
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
doing was Henny Penney a hen
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
yes yes but it could be you know a
 
02:58:24.030 --> 02:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
chicken or a hen it really doesn't
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
matter the whole principle is that the
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
sky was not falling but Henny peny
 
02:58:33.429 --> 02:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
short predicted everybody that the sky
 
02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
was falling yeah I'm certainly not an
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
underwriter or Healthcare Economist and
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why I think the association
 
02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
was careful in this testimony which I
 
02:58:43.950 --> 02:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
haven't handed out I apologize um to not
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
be over dramatic about you you know what
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
might be perceived impacts but to
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
observe that there were up upward
 
02:58:52.910 --> 02:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
pressures uh we struggled to look at the
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
bill and see how it would cause downward
 
02:58:57.710 --> 02:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
pressure on rates but I can certainly
 
02:58:58.910 --> 02:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
speak with some of the county
 
02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
administrators and nursing Hill
 
02:59:02.910 --> 02:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
administrators who are responsible for
 
02:59:05.469 --> 02:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
uh for ensuring the county against um
 
02:59:09.070 --> 02:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
losses and exposure and rful death and
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
and just one quick thank you very much
 
02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:16.040 align:start position:0%

insurance premium is structured um I
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
would um need a little bit of time to
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that but I think for
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%

and Casualty Insurance that's written in
 
03:01:35.469 --> 03:01:35.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we are very
 
03:01:37.550 --> 03:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about this
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill I know it's been a very long
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
hearing uh you've been very patient and
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining interest in it uh I will try
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
to be brief but there are some points I
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that are important to make there
 
03:01:55.790 --> 03:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
have been it's one thing to have a
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
policy disagreement about where Cap
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
should be and what's fair it's another
 
03:02:03.630 --> 03:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
to disagree about the facts and the
 
03:02:05.229 --> 03:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
primary disagreement that I've heard
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
today is the trial lawyer is saying to
 
03:02:10.229 --> 03:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
you that this will not increase premiums
 
03:02:12.910 --> 03:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance department uh in its
 
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and its fiscal note saying
 
03:02:18.750 --> 03:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
that they're very concerned about the
 
03:02:20.510 --> 03:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
increase in premiums that this bill
 
03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
03:02:25.469 --> 03:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
produce and the concerns that others uh
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
have uh expressed about what the effect
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
on their premiums would be if this bill
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
were to
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
pass there's a way to resolve that
 
03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
dispute um the uh experts on uh pricing
 
03:02:43.630 --> 03:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
of insurance are not the trial
 
03:02:46.389 --> 03:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers um they are more the insurance
 
03:02:48.510 --> 03:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
department and within in the insurance
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
department the this field is Insurance
 
03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
Actuarial work that whose function it is
 
03:02:58.590 --> 03:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
to look at circumstances and predict
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
what future losses will be now this bill
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
did not come up out of nowhere in New
 
03:03:08.349 --> 03:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's part of a national effort
 
03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
that was uh bills were proposed in 11
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
states some in the last couple of years
 
03:03:16.269 --> 03:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
some states have enacted them States
 
03:03:18.750 --> 03:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
like New York pass a bill but Governor
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hershel vetoed that bill out of concerns
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the increase in New York
 
03:03:27.710 --> 03:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh Maryland uh had a similar proposal to
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
raise its caps and that bill was
 
03:03:31.950 --> 03:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
defeated uh in Maryland
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
recently in both Maryland and New York
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature had a the benefit of
 
03:03:40.510 --> 03:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
actual orial studies that predicted what
 
03:03:43.389 --> 03:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
the loss would be in New Hampshire
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
milman did a
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
study uh and a acttion o firm in
 
03:03:51.830 --> 03:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
Maryland also did exactly what uh is the
 
03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
subject of uh your inquiry today what
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
would this bill do to Insurance costs
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
how it will affect the nonprofits the
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the businesses in the
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
state that are doing business and that
 
03:04:07.229 --> 03:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
answerable um I should mention uh Mr
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
chairman that this bill was filed as a
 
03:04:15.550 --> 03:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
confidential bill and we didn't find out
 
03:04:17.429 --> 03:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
about it and I don't think anyone else
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
did until uh shortly before not long
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
before the hearing no one in the senate
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
had asked us or anybody uh to quantify
 
03:04:30.389 --> 03:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
the cost of the bill they've represented
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
that it won't cost anything you know can
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
I can I just interrupt for a second Mr R
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
did I I want to make sure I I think you
 
03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
might have misspoken or maybe I
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstood but did you say that
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
Millum had done a study of New Hampshire
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
rates no if I did I I I I have misspoken
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
mman The asial Firm did a study in New
 
03:04:54.990 --> 03:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
York of the effect on rates in New York
 
03:04:57.309 --> 03:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
and In fairness it should be said that
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh the the uh apples and apples
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
comparison is not easy because New York
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
has very restrictive uh recoveries right
 
03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
now unlike New Hampshire so the effect
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
in New York one might guess is is going
 
03:05:13.630 --> 03:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
to be greater than the the premium
 
03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
effect uh in New Hampshire but that
 
03:05:18.269 --> 03:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen
 
03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
and in the study and melan if I recall
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
correctly uh the projected increase in
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
New York uh if his bill went through was
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
something like an average of 11%
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
slightly higher for self- insurance
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
increase of costs and again I I'd be
 
03:05:36.750 --> 03:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you the the study if
 
03:05:39.309 --> 03:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
you'd be interested in seeing it but I I
 
03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
think it was as high as a 40% uh
 
03:05:44.190 --> 03:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
increase on medical malpractice premiums
 
03:05:46.510 --> 03:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
that was that was projected in New York
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
so because of of that the governor in in
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
New York vetoed that
 
03:05:52.439 --> 03:05:55.309 align:start position:0%
New York vetoed that
bill

03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
so the first question I think is what is
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
the cost and I think the answer is let's
 
03:06:02.910 --> 03:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
find out the cost before uh the
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislature goes ahead and makes a
 
03:06:07.830 --> 03:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
judgment about passing this bill this
 
03:06:10.990 --> 03:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill by the way uh is not just an
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
increase to cover the cost of living
 
03:06:19.630 --> 03:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.950 --> 03:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
but the increase I'm looking at line 15
 
03:06:26.110 --> 03:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
03:06:30.229 --> 03:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
in spousal Consortium claims is from
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
$150,000 to
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and the increase in parent
 
03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
child claims would rise from
 
03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to
 
03:06:44.990 --> 03:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so to follow the example of one
 
03:06:48.750 --> 03:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
of the Witnesses in favor of this
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
bill the consequence of this bill with
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
four children and a spouse the increase
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
would be $1.3 million higher than what
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
is allowed under current law in that
 
03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:03.030 align:start position:0%
is allowed under current law in that
particular

03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:04.550 align:start position:0%
particular
case

03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
so how can you not say that this is
 
03:07:10.349 --> 03:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
going to increase costs it may be uh a
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
low frequency uh occurrence but it's a
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
high severity occurrence to use uh
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
Insurance terms
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
so the next point that is
 
03:07:25.150 --> 03:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
suggested uh is that we're an outlier
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
somehow we're very cheap in what we
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
award to uh parents and and uh children
 
03:07:36.389 --> 03:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
and spouses and that's just not true um
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
we do have as is pointed out low um caps
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
relative to some other states but some
 
03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
states do not allow an action
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh for Consortium or for parent child at
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
all if you look and we've asked people
 
03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
to do that to to look beyond
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
the the surface and evaluate overall in
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
wrongful death cases where does New
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stand relative to other states
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the conclusion is that we're in the
 
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
mainstream of States some are higher
 
03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
some neighboring states are higher but
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
many are were somewhere in the
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
mainstream is the conclusion again I can
 
03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
provide you more detail if you want that
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
but don't think that uh just because one
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
element of the recoveries is limited
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
more than some other states do that we
 
03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
do not compensate people adequately uh
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
in wrongful death
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
cases and to that end again I know it's
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
late but there are three parts of this
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill the first part is wrongful death
 
03:08:48.030 --> 03:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
claims that the estate can bring
 
03:08:50.830 --> 03:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
and that is money that is shared by the
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
the surviving spouse and the children
 
03:08:57.070 --> 03:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
ordinarily and as has been
 
03:08:59.469 --> 03:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned that recovery is uncapped and
 
03:09:02.429 --> 03:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's very Broad and it includes unlike
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
most States uh an element of Damages
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
known as hedonic damages which is loss
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
of the enjoyment of life of the decedent
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
recoveries in wrongful death cases are
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
significant right
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
now and as chairman has pointed out the
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
parent child and the spousal uh
 
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
Consortium claims are an add-on to the
 
03:09:36.910 --> 03:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
made so our concerns and I think the
 
03:09:41.070 --> 03:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised by the
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department are not just what
 
03:09:47.469 --> 03:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
are the consequences on premiums but uh
 
03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
what are the consequences on
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
availability of insurance and I think
 
03:09:56.110 --> 03:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
uhu um that was uh suggested by uh Mr
 
03:09:58.349 --> 03:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
Bradley uh a concern of the hospital
 
03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
Association and it is to us as well and
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
moreover New Hampshire and I'll conclude
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
with this New Hampshire is a state that
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
has a balanced system of Civil Justice
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
in our opinion and I think in the
 
03:10:15.150 --> 03:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
opinion of of lawyers both plff and
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers it's a fair and balanced
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
system Our concern is not to disturb
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
that balance the benefit of a fair
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
system and one that's perceived as fair
 
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
is that it promotes
 
03:10:33.150 --> 03:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
competition uh uh for in
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh it it encourages insurers
 
03:10:39.550 --> 03:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
to write here and the result of that is
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
lower premiums and we enjoy lower
 
03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
premiums overall than uh most other
 
03:10:49.150 --> 03:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
states um so we're concerned about
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
sending a message if this bill were to
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
pass with these extraordinary increases
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh that it would uh uh it would uh be
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
detrimental to to that reputation and to
 
03:11:05.550 --> 03:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
new hampture uh as being viewed as a
 
03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
good environment in which to do business
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
so we we would oppose this bill but if
 
03:11:13.630 --> 03:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
you do want to look at it we ask you to
 
03:11:15.150 --> 03:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
be armed with the facts and then make
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
your policy judgment as to what in
 
03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
your policy judgment as to what in
approp

03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
approp
 
03:11:20.590 --> 03:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
change if any would be thank you very
 
03:11:23.070 --> 03:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
much Mr Russ uh questions for this
 
03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you sir thank
 
03:11:37.389 --> 03:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:40.469 --> 03:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon um Mr chair
 
03:11:41.710 --> 03:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Rob
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
Barry I'm general counsel to the New
 
03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Division of Medicaid uh we are
 
03:11:49.469 --> 03:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
here uh in a neutral capacity with this
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill but we did want to get um a point
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
out there for the committee's
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
consideration you've heard a lot of
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
testimony relative to Upward pressure on
 
03:12:00.349 --> 03:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
premiums uh and the effect on the
 
03:12:03.389 --> 03:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
potential provider Comm uh Community New
 
03:12:05.070 --> 03:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid's primary concern is
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our members have access to
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
Quality Care particularly in underserved
 
03:12:13.389 --> 03:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
areas um if this prediction were true
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about the effect of um
 
03:12:18.990 --> 03:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
driving out current providers and
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
thereby resulting in fewer providers for
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
our member Community uh obviously this
 
03:12:25.469 --> 03:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
is a very complicated issue um and I
 
03:12:26.830 --> 03:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
leave it to the uh committee's best
 
03:12:28.229 --> 03:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
judgment on that but we just wanted to
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
put this out there as a potential
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
consequence and I'm happy to take any
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
 
03:12:36.429 --> 03:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
03:12:39.070 --> 03:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative men sorry thank thank you
 
03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um how
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on how this would affect
 
03:12:47.950 --> 03:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid if there's an upward pressure
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
on the premiums as predicted by many
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
people here uh I know that's a source of
 
03:12:57.229 --> 03:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
contention uh and I'm not here to
 
03:12:59.550 --> 03:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
resolve that contention uh because that
 
03:13:03.190 --> 03:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
is not my um my expertise but the
 
03:13:05.910 --> 03:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
concern from Medicaid's perspective is
 
03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
if that prediction does bow true that an
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on premiums leads to
 
03:13:14.590 --> 03:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
Providers leaving the state results in
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
fewer providers for the Medicaid
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
community that's where we're
 
03:13:22.030 --> 03:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
at right other questions for this
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the the record my name is
 
03:13:50.190 --> 03:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
Dave juv I'm a senior vice president
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
Association we are a uh Statewide
 
03:13:56.750 --> 03:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce a membership
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
organization with over 400 employer
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
members and we are here on behalf of our
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
employers throughout the state we are
 
03:14:08.349 --> 03:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I'd like to
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
primarily address a number of comments
 
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
that have been made in the testimony up
 
03:14:14.429 --> 03:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
to now one of which chairman Lynn you
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
were asking um speculating why we would
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
have a cap at all when we don't cap any
 
03:14:23.710 --> 03:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
other types of wrongful death Awards and
 
03:14:25.950 --> 03:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is it was a
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
result of legislative
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
compromise uh previous to 1997 there was
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
no loss of Consortium award in New
 
03:14:35.710 --> 03:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at that time a bill was
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward to allow for that um one
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
side uh uh represented here today
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
supported that the other side
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
represented by many people here today
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
opposed it and the uh compromise that
 
03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
was struck that both sides could live
 
03:15:00.110 --> 03:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
with while not being uh necessarily
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
happy about was the cap of 150,000 for
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
loss of spouse and 50,000 for loss of
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
child uh previous witness talked about
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
the uh history of this specific Bill and
 
03:15:15.070 --> 03:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
they noted correctly that the bill when
 
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
it was introduced was uh a removal of
 
03:15:20.750 --> 03:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
all caps relating to loss of
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
Consortium um as you can imagine there
 
03:15:26.590 --> 03:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
was strong opposition to that in the
 
03:15:30.309 --> 03:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
Senate and uh the the uh witness
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
correctly said
 
03:15:35.070 --> 03:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
that I can paraphrase that they would
 
03:15:37.469 --> 03:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
have been happy with a cap of a million
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
which would mirror what we have in Maine
 
03:15:42.510 --> 03:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
but the senate in their wisdom decided
 
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
to lower it to
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
500,000 for loss of spouse and 300 ,000
 
03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
for loss of child want to make it clear
 
03:15:53.309 --> 03:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
that was not a compromise that those
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill could live with or
 
03:15:59.910 --> 03:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
could support we did not support that
 
03:16:03.630 --> 03:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
and most of us here today who are uh
 
03:16:06.830 --> 03:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
oppos to that or or continue our
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
opposition um just one other quick bit
 
03:16:12.309 --> 03:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
of information there was a previous
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
witness and and he was at the Senate
 
03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
hearing too who uh felt it was important
 
03:16:20.910 --> 03:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you clearly understood
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
that uh increasing this cap or removing
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
the cap entirely wouldn't affect workers
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
comp rates um I'm not an attorney but
 
03:16:31.710 --> 03:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
I'll use an attorney that or I'll use a
 
03:16:33.429 --> 03:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
phrase that attorneys use which is
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
stipulate we will stipulate that it
 
03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
won't increase workers comp rates no one
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
has suggested it would I'm a little
 
03:16:43.790 --> 03:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
mystified why he wants to continue to
 
03:16:46.349 --> 03:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
point to that but it won't affect
 
03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
workers comp rates it will I believe
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
affect other forms of Insurance
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
liability insurance or medical
 
03:16:55.229 --> 03:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance which is why we
 
03:16:58.590 --> 03:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
oppose it now I mentioned the original
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
Law setting this up was a result of a
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
compromise and it was something that
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
both sides could live with if not
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
support one thing that hasn't come up in
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this hearing so far is well it this
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
amount hasn't been increased since 1996
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
s and shouldn't we we be looking at an
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
increase and for those on the committee
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable killing the bill or
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
sending it to study but you're equally
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable on a dramatic increase
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
which is how the bill came over for the
 
03:17:39.870 --> 03:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
Senate there is um a Middle Road um I
 
03:17:42.309 --> 03:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
want to be clear Bia would support you
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
killing the bill or sending it to study
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
but the Middle Road that you might
 
03:17:46.399 --> 03:17:48.309 align:start position:0%
but the Middle Road that you might
consider

03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
is what would this be today if it were
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
tied to the inflation rate and I looked
 
03:17:57.229 --> 03:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
I used the uh Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the Federal Department of Labor
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
CPI calculator and found that the $150
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
,000 award in
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
1997 in current dollars would be worth
 
03:18:09.439 --> 03:18:12.349 align:start position:0%
1997 in current dollars would be worth
approximately

03:18:12.349 --> 03:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:14.510 --> 03:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
$294,000 and the
 
03:18:17.469 --> 03:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
$50,000 award for loss of child or
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
parent in
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
$224 would be approximately
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
$98,000 and I think you'll see that's
 
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
well below what the Senate uh Bill set
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
those awards
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
at I'm not suggesting those opposed to
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
the bill would support that middle
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
ground I'm pretty sure that those
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill would also not to
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
support it but in many ways that would
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
equal what probably happened in 1996
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
which is uh the legislature came up with
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
a compromise recognizing that there's
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
strong opposition on both sides of the
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue happy to answer any questions if I
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
can questions for this
 
03:19:01.710 --> 03:19:01.720 align:start position:0%

Hampshire 1994 maybe so not quite the
 
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
whole 40 years I would love to be able
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
to rebut or comment on all of the
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
different issues that have been raised
 
03:19:40.750 --> 03:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to 462 um but I'm not
 
03:19:42.269 --> 03:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
going to take your time it's been a long
 
03:19:44.110 --> 03:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
day already I'll will try to limit
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
myself to taking and make making an
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
argument and making some issues from
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a satellite view level the macro
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
level as to this issue and then
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
something on a micro more personal level
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
on the macro level um you've heard
 
03:20:01.229 --> 03:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
virtually all the talk today has been on
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of will this raise premiums
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
lots of Scare Tactics about pressure on
 
03:20:08.429 --> 03:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
premiums and all that kind of stuff you
 
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
folks all know much better than I do
 
03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
because you sit in these hearings all
 
03:20:16.750 --> 03:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
the time that argument is made day in
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
day out on so many different bills so
 
03:20:21.710 --> 03:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
many requests for immunity we want to be
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
able to do something but the insurance
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
will be so much we have to have immunity
 
03:20:28.110 --> 03:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
from liability um all sorts of things
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
are considered it's going to put
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
pressure the insurance industry has more
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
data available to it than anybody else
 
03:20:38.670 --> 03:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
in the world and yet somehow they always
 
03:20:41.830 --> 03:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
can only talk about upward pressure
 
03:20:44.590 --> 03:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
their customers are concerned that their
 
03:20:46.510 --> 03:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
rates might go up and that might put
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
them out of business doctors are
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
concerned their premiums will go up
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
nobody ever talks about the data that
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry could bring to
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
bear on the issue if they chose
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
to and you kind of have to wonder why
 
03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because the data doesn't
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
support the argument and they're better
 
03:21:07.790 --> 03:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
off just scaring their insurance
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
customers into saying we're afraid
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
please protect us let me just give you a
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
practical real world argument as to why
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry that this is
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge increase in premiums
 
03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
it'll be tiny if any at
 
03:21:26.830 --> 03:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
all these are wrongful death cases we're
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
talking about There is almost no such
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
thing as a wrongful death case that
 
03:21:33.510 --> 03:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
isn't worth at least a million dollar
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
settlement can we agree on that I don't
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
think anybody would disagree loss of a
 
03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
life whether it's an income earner or an
 
03:21:43.469 --> 03:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
atome mom or a child it's there has to
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
be compensation of at least a million
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
dollars you know how many insurance
 
03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
policies for liability that include
 
03:21:53.309 --> 03:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
death and uh and injury you know how
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
many of those insurance policies are
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
worth more than a million dollars in
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
coverage almost
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
none I don't think in 45 years I've seen
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
more than one or two cases where there
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
was more than a million dollar insurance
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
policy they're usually with major
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
trucking companies they have good siiz
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
policies major manufacturers have
 
03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
good-sized policies and I guess doctors
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
and hospitals have good siiz policies
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
but the vast vast majority of wrongful
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
death cases are going to settle for the
 
03:22:23.950 --> 03:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
policy limit of a million dollar before
 
03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
we even talk about loss of Consortium so
 
03:22:30.189 --> 03:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
in those cases whether there's a cap
 
03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
Consortium is totally irrelevant doesn't
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
raise anything there are however a few
 
03:22:38.110 --> 03:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
cases like Holly Haynes mentioned one of
 
03:22:41.710 --> 03:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
her own clients an at home mom who's a
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
caregiver to her kids doesn't work she's
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
killed instantly so so because she's
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
killed instantly there's no subjective
 
03:22:54.670 --> 03:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
recovery for pain and suffering damages
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
because she's not a wage earner there's
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
no recovery for a lifetime of lost
 
03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
income or the amount of that income she
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
would have shared with her family
 
03:23:06.269 --> 03:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
literally the only recovery available to
 
03:23:06.279 --> 03:23:07.550 align:start position:0%
literally the only recovery available to
that

03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
person is well to the family of that
 
03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
person is the loss of Consortium the
 
03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
things mom would have done for me as I
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
was rais
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
the things my wife would have done for
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
me as a husband taking care of the
 
03:23:22.319 --> 03:23:24.429 align:start position:0%
me as a husband taking care of the
household

03:23:24.429 --> 03:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
household
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
unless imagine in that situation your
 
03:23:30.189 --> 03:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
entire recovery is
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for the loss of your wife and
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
50,000 uh and each of the kids getting
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
50,000 for the loss of
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
Mom we have talked exclusively about
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
what chairman Lynn talks about calls the
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
tail of the dog haven't heard much about
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
the dog and the dog we should be talking
 
03:23:53.830 --> 03:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
about is what's
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
fair what's the right thing to do is it
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
fair for the family of that Mom who
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't work to be limited to a total of
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
what might be $200,000 in
 
03:24:08.349 --> 03:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
recovery every time every time there's a
 
03:24:09.630 --> 03:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
wrongful death actually every time
 
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's a serious injury there's going
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
to be some loss there's going to be
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to hurt monetarily
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the question is where do we put that
 
03:24:22.830 --> 03:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
hurt do we put it on the person who
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
caused it and perhaps on the insurance
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
company who just was agreeable to making
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
a huge profit in order to take the risk
 
03:24:33.189 --> 03:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
on themselves like someone said you know
 
03:24:35.309 --> 03:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
insurance is all about the premiums of
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
the many pay the costs of the few well
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid what they're lobbying for is
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
the premiums of the many pay for our
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
profit and only part of the loss of the
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
few that's what they're arguing for
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
so the question is where does the State
 
03:24:50.189 --> 03:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire come in on talking
 
03:24:52.349 --> 03:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
about what's fair when we do these do we
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
want full recovery or do we not let me
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
throw it a ridiculous hypothetical let's
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
assume there's a wrongful death and the
 
03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
only recovery will be loss of Consortium
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a whole lot but you know
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
this person's life was worth millions to
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
someone we've got a couple choices we
 
03:25:11.309 --> 03:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
could make the wrongfully acting
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
defendant the negligent person pay for
 
03:25:15.389 --> 03:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
it which means perhaps their insurance
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
company pays for it
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
what if the other option is well I know
 
03:25:22.030 --> 03:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
to keep prices down to keep insurance
 
03:25:24.269 --> 03:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
premiums down so we don't have doctors
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
leaving the state and we don't have
 
03:25:27.870 --> 03:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies choosing to do their
 
03:25:30.110 --> 03:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
business elsewhere to keep it down let's
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
just do a lottery Whenever there a
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
wrongful death we'll pick a name out of
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
a hat some resident of the state and
 
03:25:37.870 --> 03:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
we'll make them pay the millions of
 
03:25:39.309 --> 03:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of damage that was caused
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
to that family obviously that's
 
03:25:44.110 --> 03:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
preposterous but you know what we're
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
already doing it we're doing it because
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
the lottery winner or the lottery loser
 
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
has already been chosen she was chosen
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
when the negligent driver crashed into
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
her car and killed her she was chosen
 
03:25:58.590 --> 03:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
when the manufacturer made something
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
that was defective and something blew up
 
03:26:03.469 --> 03:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
and killed her instantly we have already
 
03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
chosen the loser right now and the loser
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
who has to pay all is the person who
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
just happened to be the Unlucky
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
individual who got killed and her family
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
and this time we recognize that's what
 
03:26:15.070 --> 03:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
we're really doing that's the equivalent
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
of drawing a lottery why not make it
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
that the person who did the bad thing
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
and the industry they're part of just
 
03:26:24.510 --> 03:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
all share the cost it's part of the cost
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
business I I submit that's really what
 
03:26:32.670 --> 03:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do we need to look at a fair
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
way of making sure these large harms and
 
03:26:39.550 --> 03:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
losses for a very few individuals are
 
03:26:41.790 --> 03:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
not stuck on those
 
03:26:44.910 --> 03:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
individuals so let me look at it now on
 
03:26:47.070 --> 03:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
the more personal level
 
03:26:49.469 --> 03:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
micro level when I was driving up here I

Hennessy I am the deputy secretary of

state I don't usually come before this
 
03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee most of my time is spent in
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
election law um and various other
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
committees in the house but I wanted to
 
03:31:36.070 --> 03:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
talk to you about this bill because it
 
03:31:39.790 --> 03:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
affects um your town clerks and um the
 
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
division of art art um Department um the
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
vital Record division
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
um I have some concerns away about the
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
way this is written just as um someone
 
03:31:56.189 --> 03:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
who unfortunately had to be an executive
 
03:31:59.309 --> 03:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
of a will um of of an estate um when my
 
03:32:01.630 --> 03:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
mother recently passed away and I don't
 
03:32:04.349 --> 03:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
understand how um one the executiv would
 
03:32:06.030 --> 03:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
know that they needed to do this within
 
03:32:10.030 --> 03:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
30 days um two who the clerk would be
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to reach out to um
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
is it they're um the person who passed
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
away city or town clerk um or is it just
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
any clerk um and what if they don't do
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
this what would happen to them um right
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
now the way that um death notice are um
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
people are removed from the checklist
 
03:32:32.429 --> 03:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist when someone passes
 
03:32:35.469 --> 03:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
away is that the um Vital Records
 
03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
database um is bumped up against the
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration database
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
and um matches are sent to your
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist and and
 
03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
they need to review those and if they
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
determine that it is a match then they
 
03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
will remove that voter from the
 
03:32:55.189 --> 03:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
checklist um sometimes there may be some
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
delays in this process because if a um
 
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
if the supervisors haven't met in a
 
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
month or so um then they won't be
 
03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
removed that quickly also if for some
 
03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
reason the person who passes away the
 
03:33:10.830 --> 03:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
person who fills out the um death
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
certificate puts them as living um as
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
their address as being where they were
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
living with them most recently versus
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
where they may be registered to vote so
 
03:33:23.070 --> 03:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
if I live in Littleton and somebody was
 
03:33:24.990 --> 03:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
living with me before they passed away I
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
may have put my Littleton address as
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
their address versus where they may be
 
03:33:31.750 --> 03:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
their voting um address may have been
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
someplace else and they just hadn't
 
03:33:35.710 --> 03:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
voted in a while um I'm happy to take
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions on this I know this is not a
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
normal process that um election law
 
03:33:42.269 --> 03:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
process that we talk about with this
 
03:33:44.110 --> 03:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
committee but any questions you might
 
03:33:46.750 --> 03:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
have I'm happy to answer
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horan and then
 
03:33:48.640 --> 03:33:50.110 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horan and then
representative

03:33:50.110 --> 03:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
Smith yes um how how common also this
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
way I read this bill well first of all
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
ret Dev vote is voluntary so I don't
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
understand these people but there are
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
some people who like say I don't want to
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
vote I don't want to encourage those
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
politicians so um what happens if when
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
one of those people's dies and then
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
there also course many people in the
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
state who are not citizens but still
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
when they die that has to be reported so
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
how how would the How would how would
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
that impact those situations like um how
 
03:34:24.110 --> 03:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
would they even know like whether the
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
clerk needs to get an announcement for
 
03:34:25.720 --> 03:34:26.710 align:start position:0%
clerk needs to get an announcement for
those

03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
people thank you for the question I am
 
03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
not the sponsor of the bill so I think I
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
would putting out to answer that I was
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
follow up maybe this one maybe you can't
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
answer have
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
there course you're not responsib but
 
03:34:43.950 --> 03:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
there been any allegations where a
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
recently deceased
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
were problems of people um voting um
 
03:34:54.110 --> 03:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
voting any are there any allegations of
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
deceased people like um having their
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
votes recorded improperly because
 
03:34:59.469 --> 03:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
somebody's impersonating them or for
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reasons those are actually a
 
03:35:02.670 --> 03:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
problem here for this bill to solve in
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
your experience
 
03:35:07.189 --> 03:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
or I don't know that there have been but
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
I think the AG might be able to answer
 
03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
I think the AG might be able to answer
that

03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:14.110 --> 03:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
better representative
 
03:35:16.389 --> 03:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
um I've been trying to keep track of the
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
systems that are being used is there um
 
03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
not a new system that is or a new effort
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
to coordinate systems that already
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
exists um in the Secretary of State's
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
office thank you for the question and if
 
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
I understand it correctly there is there
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
are already two systems that exist to do
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
this the um the nean system system is
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
the system that Vital Records uses for
 
03:35:50.910 --> 03:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
death certificates birth certificates
 
03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:52.189 align:start position:0%
death certificates birth certificates
marriage

03:35:52.189 --> 03:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
certificates and some other things as
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
well um and then there's the Statewide
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
voter registration system it used um
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're calling it Statewide voter
 
03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
registration system now because the new
 
03:36:04.269 --> 03:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
one's rolling out and should go live
 
03:36:06.389 --> 03:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
fairly soon and those two systems talk
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
to each other and that's how within the
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system the
 
03:36:13.870 --> 03:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors get notification when
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that is registered on their
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
checklist passes away is that is that
 
03:36:19.229 --> 03:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
what you
 
03:36:23.630 --> 03:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
asked yes yes it is and I guess I know
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's not your bill and you're you're
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
just here to talk about what you do
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
which is what I'm curious about does
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
that not mean that this is um a solution
 
03:36:40.349 --> 03:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for the question um
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer you know that
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know since you've sat on this side
 
03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
of the table also you know you don't
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to answer that I don't know I think
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
there may be some instances where maybe
 
03:36:56.720 --> 03:36:57.710 align:start position:0%
there may be some instances where maybe
some

03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:37:01.189 --> 03:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
supervisors didn't meet timely
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
and from what I was told there may have
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
been an instance where somebody's name
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
was still on the checklist but that
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
person had passed
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
away um but had they
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
voted not that I know of
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
no so I repeat my question yeah you are
 
03:37:22.510 --> 03:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
not aware of any need are you aware of
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
any need for this bill to be passed in
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we have a more
 
03:37:29.279 --> 03:37:31.389 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we have a more
um

03:37:31.389 --> 03:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:31.399 --> 03:37:33.710 align:start position:0%
um
accurate

03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh record of who is voting thank you uh
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
necessary yes representative
 
03:37:47.309 --> 03:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
um with somebody who has passed away
 
03:37:55.630 --> 03:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
their name still being on a voter
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
checklist um absent any notification
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
thereof would that not create the
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
potential for um misappropriation of an
 
03:38:07.950 --> 03:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot by some method by an you
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
actor if for some reason say somebody's
 
03:38:17.910 --> 03:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
name on the checklist is Robert um and
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
their name is noted on their the desri
 
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
is Bob with a different address then
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
those would not match up in our system
 
03:38:27.070 --> 03:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
and there is the opportunity for that
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
person to still be on their local
 
03:38:32.429 --> 03:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
checklist until the 10-year um automatic
 
03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
Purge y um then um there is an
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a bad actor to illegally
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot in that
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
person's name um that ballot will go to
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
that person's address so that person
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be living at their address
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
um and also vote illegally but there are
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
um things that would happen to that
 
03:39:03.790 --> 03:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
person if they were to do that and I'm
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer and I've never been on
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary one would hope yes
 
03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:09.309 align:start position:0%
Judiciary one would hope yes
representative

03:39:09.309 --> 03:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
Horgan well maybe I should saved this
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
for a theoretical work session but know
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
and know it's probably probably heard of
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
other incident incidents this uh Madam
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
SEC deputy secretary of state but in my
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
family actually the last conversation I
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
had with my mother who had a stroke a
 
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
few days before the N for primary where
 
03:39:28.110 --> 03:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
she was assuring me that she had um
 
03:39:29.710 --> 03:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
filled in her absentee ballot and
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
written and and uh like she told me who
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
she voted for and how she voted but
 
03:39:38.670 --> 03:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh but um but in that case she
 
03:39:40.510 --> 03:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
was alive when she requested the ballot
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
and live when she filled it out and she
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
was intending to still be alive on uh
 
03:39:46.750 --> 03:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
January 23rd when the ballots were open
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
and counted but uh unforeseen
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances prevented that but
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I then but this bill probably doesn't
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily affect that in so far as
 
03:39:58.590 --> 03:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
they might have stricken the name from
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
the checklist before the election day
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
but um actually do you have any data on
 
03:40:05.790 --> 03:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
how often that happens if somebody
 
03:40:07.469 --> 03:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
legitimately fills on absentee ballot
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
and then not dies before the uh date of
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
the election thank you for the question
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
I may be able to get data on that that
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
what would happen in that instance where
 
03:40:20.429 --> 03:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
um if somebody knew that that person had
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
passed away the absentee ballot would be
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
rejected and um the reason written on it
 
03:40:27.389 --> 03:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
would be because um the voter was
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
deceased and then um later when it goes
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
into the Statewide voter registration
 
03:40:34.110 --> 03:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
system to document the reason why that
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
ballot was rejected that would be the
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
reason in there um I think our new
 
03:40:39.870 --> 03:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
system will have a lot better um
 
03:40:41.710 --> 03:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanisms to actually get
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
that data for you but that unfortunately
 
03:40:47.070 --> 03:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
does happen quite often yeah I know I
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
can answer that like and I know like
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
years ago when I was uh working at the
 
03:40:53.670 --> 03:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
polls in Durham the moderator not the
 
03:40:56.590 --> 03:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
current moderator but previous one um we
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
got we actually that question arose we
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
got in a absente B for particular
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
individuals prominent person in town and
 
03:41:04.830 --> 03:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
we said um should we count this you know
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
like uh so and so is dead and actually
 
03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
the moderator gave what was a very uh
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
very very amusing answer that lightened
 
03:41:15.309 --> 03:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
the mood although it was incorrect was
 
03:41:17.469 --> 03:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
says like well Was he alive at the time
 
03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
when he filled out the ballot and we
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
said well as far as we can tell judging
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
by yes he said then we should count it
 
03:41:24.910 --> 03:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
which certainly emotionally feels like
 
03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do even though that
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
was probably not what the RSA actually
 
03:41:31.349 --> 03:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
said about it but
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank all right uh representative Manos
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just wondering about New
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who die out of state
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
and how the vital statistics system
 
03:41:47.790 --> 03:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
interacts with the voter system thank
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I believe for
 
03:41:51.790 --> 03:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
Most states and sometimes there's gaps
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
in there um those States would um send
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
notify our state um usually it's just in
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
paper copies of of death notices and
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
then our Vital Records Department inputs
 
03:42:05.429 --> 03:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
that information into our Vital Records
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
database and um then that matches up
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
with our Statewide voter registration
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
database and then your supervisor would
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative trip thank you chair um
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going have to show my ignorance here
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
because uh I
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
haven't ever requested an absente ballot
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't know uh can you request a
 
03:42:33.359 --> 03:42:34.910 align:start position:0%
so I don't know uh can you request a
absentee

03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.269 --> 03:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
mail uh you can request an absentee
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
ballot via the mail
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
follow up y well then uh is there some
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
sort of uh protocol that ensures that
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
someone who requests a absentee ballot
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
by mail is the person who's going to be
 
03:43:06.149 --> 03:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
voting um thank you for the question um
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
when you request an a an absentee ballot
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
you have to sign that um you are the
 
03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
person requesting the absentee ballot um
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
as well is when you return your absentee
 
03:43:19.830 --> 03:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
ballot um on the affidavit envelope you
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
are signing that you are the voter that
 
03:43:25.389 --> 03:43:25.399 align:start position:0%
is voting with that unless um someone
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
has assisted you which is legal um in
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
filling out that um ballot because
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
you're unable to fill it out yourself so
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
there was there's many times that you
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
are attesting that you are that person
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and when you do that ATT attestation
 
03:43:43.070 --> 03:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
if you're lying you're breaking a law
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
and sorry I don't have I didn't bring my
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
election law book was made to give you
 
03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:50.229 align:start position:0%
election law book was made to give you
the

03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
statutes other questions so I guess I I
 
03:43:54.750 --> 03:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
have and I and I apologize because I you
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
may have answered this already and and I
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't paying attention and I apologize
 
03:44:01.630 --> 03:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
for that but when it says in the part of
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that's not not subject to the
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
amendment Whenever there is filed in the
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
office of the clerk an official notice
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the death of any person over 18 so my
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
question is does
 
03:44:17.950 --> 03:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
somebody does does somebody have an
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
obligation to give the clerk that notice
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
in other words is there somebody if if I
 
03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
die today does does some does my wife
 
03:44:29.469 --> 03:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
does somebody have an obligation to
 
03:44:31.870 --> 03:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
notify the clerk that I
 
03:44:33.870 --> 03:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
died thank you for the question Mr
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um no the you you you do not
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
have the obligation the um the clerk
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
will know because through the death
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
certificate process that will be in the
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
vital record database that they they
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
have access
 
03:44:51.550 --> 03:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
to but so okay so I died by the there's
 
03:44:53.550 --> 03:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
a death certificate it goes to the vital
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
records the does does the clerk then
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to check the vital
 
03:45:01.560 --> 03:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to check the vital
records

03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
records
 
03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
every you know and if so how often do
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
that are you asking is the clerk have
 
03:45:14.110 --> 03:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to update the voter
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
checklist based on that
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
information well in other words does
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
does it does the clerk have some
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to to access the death
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
certificates and say okay you know like
 
03:45:30.149 --> 03:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
once a year once every three years once
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
do they have any obligation to do that
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
or can a clerk just not do
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
that so the only instances that the that
 
03:45:39.510 --> 03:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
I know of that the clerk would need to
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
do that is if the supervisors have asked
 
03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
them to do it to run they can run a
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
report of um voters who have passed away
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
in their town they have only have access
 
03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
to their Town um in V records
 
03:45:54.429 --> 03:45:54.439 align:start position:0%
information um and the supervisors can
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
use that to make sure that the matching
 
03:45:58.750 --> 03:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
system caught everyone and there were no
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
like Bobs or Roberts that slips through
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the matching of the database but
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
other than that it's not the clerk's
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility now sometimes it is in
 
03:46:10.469 --> 03:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
cities but most of the time we're
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
talking about supervisors of the
 
03:46:13.469 --> 03:46:13.479 align:start position:0%
checklist who have the obligation to
 
03:46:15.550 --> 03:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
update update the checklist
 
03:46:16.750 --> 03:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
so and so the supervisor's obligation to
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
up to update the checklist includes
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
checking the death the notices of death
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
correct okay all
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
right okay all right thank you very much
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Andress sorry
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:46:36.680 --> 03:46:37.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
my

03:46:37.590 --> 03:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
question I'm not up on the law what
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
clerks can do do you know what Authority
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
we allow the clerks that they can change
 
03:46:51.790 --> 03:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
a name on there like if I go in and say
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
so and so his moved
 
03:46:58.030 --> 03:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
away don't no longer lives in my house
 
03:47:00.510 --> 03:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
like they pass away can they take that
 
03:47:03.710 --> 03:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
name off or what what law allows them to
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
make changes are you asking to take them
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
name off the checklist or put in that
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
they've passed away take a name off the
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
checklist no um anytime a name is
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist has to be in
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
an open session of the
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
supervisors um of the checklist who are
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
elected election officials and they have
 
03:47:26.670 --> 03:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
to do that in public session um which is
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
noticed and they will note in the
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
checklist and the checklist is also
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
before you go to vote um when you go
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
into your clerks the checklist should be
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
there in their office if you want to
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
ever look at at
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
it oh yes representa I just wanted to
 
03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
supervisors what notices are they
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
03:48:05.429 --> 03:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
accept to take names off the
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
checklist that make sense yeah it does
 
03:48:09.790 --> 03:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering do you want are we
 
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
talking about death what this bill talks
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
about okay so for someone who is passed
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
away they are allowed to without sending
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
a 30-day notice to the voter if if when
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
they go into the system and they the
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system and
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
they've got the list from the match that
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
says this voter has passed away and they
 
03:48:32.830 --> 03:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
look at the two system information yes
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct that person
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
matches they can click off and that
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
person will be removed from the
 
03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
checklist and it'll be in their minutes
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
um the um the the supervisors may also
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
request the clerk to run a report for
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
them from the system just in case the
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
match didn't catch somebody who may have
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
passed away because um they used a
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
different name on the death certificate
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
than is on the checklist for example if
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
your middle name is Aaron and your first
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
name is Katherine and you go by Aaron
 
03:49:08.349 --> 03:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
but the death certificate says Katherine
 
03:49:11.149 --> 03:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
and some somehow sometimes names don't
 
03:49:11.159 --> 03:49:11.950 align:start position:0%
and some somehow sometimes names don't
match

03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
match
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
up yeah so I have one other question if
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
we um if we were to amend this I mean I
 
03:49:23.469 --> 03:49:23.479 align:start position:0%
understand the the the argument that
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
maybe this isn't sort of strictly
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
necessary on the other hand it does seem
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
like it would help to provide another
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
level of assurance and what I'm
 
03:49:35.149 --> 03:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
wondering is if we were to amend this
 
03:49:37.469 --> 03:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
bill to put in some language that said
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
something like um the uh judicial branch
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
shall provide
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh on shall provide notice on on a
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
form by which an
 
03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
estate uh is is initially opened of the
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
obligation of the ex executive or
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
personal representative to provide the
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
notice to the clerk um that would that
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
would sort of presumably would help to
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
provide to ensure that somebody who is
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
appointed executive administrator knows
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they have that
 
03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
obligation is that I mean is that seem
 
03:50:23.550 --> 03:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
reason well if to open in the state um
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
or personal representative I mean you
 
03:50:28.149 --> 03:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
would have to you'd have to go to the
 
03:50:32.149 --> 03:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
Probate Court would you not no because
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
think I'm not a lawyer and I don't even
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
play one on TV but whether you would
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
have to go to Probate Court would depend
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
upon on the value of of the if a very
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
small level well doesn't have to be very
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
small truthfully um and uh for example
 
03:50:58.429 --> 03:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
if if everything goes to the
 
03:51:01.070 --> 03:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
spouse period the end you don't have to
 
03:51:02.349 --> 03:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
go to
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
probate um and
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh somebody has to have filed a death
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
certificate and it's not going to be the
 
03:51:13.469 --> 03:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
person who died that's the only thing I
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be somebody else and
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't have anything to do
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
with the courts and um if everything's
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
happening in the same town the death
 
03:51:25.630 --> 03:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
certificate's going to
 
03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:27.389 align:start position:0%
certificate's going to
be

03:51:27.389 --> 03:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:51:33.469 --> 03:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
basically issued through the town or
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
um sure yes representative Wallace thank
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
you um having just gone through this a
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago on Easter the way it
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked presently is once someone passes
 
03:51:46.750 --> 03:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay whoever the Undertaker is uh this
 
03:51:49.630 --> 03:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
happened at home so the funeral parlor
 
03:51:52.030 --> 03:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
files the death certificate with the
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Vital Statistics and that can
 
03:51:57.309 --> 03:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
be acquired at any town in any
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
municipality in the state so the last
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
thing I want to be doing is having the
 
03:52:03.870 --> 03:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
family member or the surviving uh family
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
member doing all this paperwork so I do
 
03:52:07.389 --> 03:52:07.399 align:start position:0%
believe it is already automatically done
 
03:52:10.750 --> 03:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
and filed by the funeral par that's as
 
03:52:13.950 --> 03:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
of three four weeks ago and my personal
 
03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
experience if that
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
helps and all the copies we get are at
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the Town Hall so I would think there'd
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
connection all right other questions for
 
03:52:32.349 --> 03:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
you no it's not but my mother-in-law is
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
Katherine Aaron Hennessy and she goes by
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%

03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.439 --> 03:53:43.429 align:start position:0%
