00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
so the hour of nine o'clock having
 
00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 align:start position:0%
arrived I'm going to open this meeting
 
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
of the joint legislative performance
 
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
audit oversight committee and
 
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
um because it is the Senate's turn to
 
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970 align:start position:0%
um because it is the Senate's turn to
reside

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
reside
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
and because I am apparently the longest
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
serving continuous member on the
 
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 align:start position:0%
committee I have been asked if I will
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
open the meeting and the first order of
 
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
business that we have is to elect a
 
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
chair from the Senate who will serve for
 
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
the next two years so with that I'm
 
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
going to throw open nominations from the
 
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
going to throw open nominations from the
floor

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll nominate Senator Rosenwald that
 
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.009 align:start position:0%
I'll nominate Senator Rosenwald that
much

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh I would entertain a
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
motion that the nominations be closed
 
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 align:start position:0%
when we cast one ballot
 
00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.790 align:start position:0%
all in favor

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.710 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
congratulations Senator Rosenwald
 
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
um this is my first time on this
 
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.949 align:start position:0%
um this is my first time on this
committee

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.149 align:start position:0%
committee
so

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
um it will be a learning process but I
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
think and we have an agenda and I see
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
that our first order of business is
 
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the November 10th meeting
 
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
minutes lots of us were not on the
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
committee then
 
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
however because it's a new legislature
 
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
we can all vote on the minutes we don't
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
have to abstain so has everybody had a
 
00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 align:start position:0%
chance to read the minutes
 
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
I would move acceptance of the minutes
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
even though I wasn't actually at that
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
last meeting a second and I was at that
 
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 align:start position:0%
last meeting okay is there any
 
00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.890 align:start position:0%
last meeting okay is there any
correction

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 align:start position:0%
correction
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
well then all in favor of accepting the
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
minutes as presented please say aye aye
 
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
and he opposed
 
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 align:start position:0%
new minutes are adopted thank you
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
um discussion of performance auditing
 
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
sure we'll take it from here thank you
 
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
congratulations and could you introduce
 
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
yourself sure for the record I'm Steve
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
Smith the director of audits for the LBA
 
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
and joining me here is uh Jay Henry he's
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
our performance audit supervisor
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
so given that we have several new
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
members we thought we'd just take a few
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
minutes and just Jay's going to kind of
 
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
do an orientation for you he's already
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
provided some handouts when we emailed
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
the agenda Etc some of the statutes that
 
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
govern the committee and performance
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
auditing but Jay will kind of walk just
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
to give you kind of a general
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
30 000 foot level view of what we do
 
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
when it comes to performance audit but
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
also in particular what the committee
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
some considerations the committee should
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
take when they're evaluating and looking
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
at topics so great so with that Jay
 
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning good morning
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
as you may know the LBA has two
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
divisions the budget division the audit
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
division budget division helps the
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
legislature with the budget and the
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
audit division we do performance Audits
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
and financial audits
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
this committee decides the topics that
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to audit for performance
 
00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.710 align:start position:0%
we're going to audit for performance
audits

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
audits evaluate past performances and
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
provides information recommendations to
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
improve government operations for
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
leaders of the agencies and the
 
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.629 align:start position:0%
leaders of the agencies and the
legislature

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
audits help to provide transparency of
 
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
government operations
 
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
the legislature has given the LBA
 
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
authority to access all types of program
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
information including confidential
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
information when it's directly related
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
to our audit topics
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
we are basically able to look under the
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
hood of programs to see how things are
 
00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:55.850 align:start position:0%
hood of programs to see how things are
running

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
well we become knowledgeable about these
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
topics we are not experts in the topics
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are our value comes into knowing how
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
programs any government program should
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
be run and understanding the internal
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
controls that agencies should have in
 
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.070 align:start position:0%
controls that agencies should have in
place

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
government auditing standards which we
 
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
follow provides a framework for
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
performing high quality work with
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
competency Integrity
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
objectivity and Independence
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
government auditing standards require us
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
to consider fraud in every audit and be
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
aware of it and think about where is it
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
likely to happen and even though it may
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
not be the focus of an audit it's
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
something we have to consider
 
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
standards require that we review at
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
least elements of our program's internal
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
control system
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
these this includes the controlled
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
environment risk assessment control
 
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
activities information and communication
 
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
and monitoring
 
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
internal control is a process affected
 
00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
by the agency's management that will
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
provide a reasonable assurance that
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
objectives of the entity will be
 
00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
objectives of the entity will be
achieved

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
performance audits take time and
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
resources it's not like a reporter just
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
simply asking questions
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have to follow the government
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
auditing standards we research the
 
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 align:start position:0%
topics the industry that that's being
 
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 align:start position:0%
that the agency
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
is is in
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
we research relevant laws rules policies
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and guidelines we seek input
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
from the agency officials staff of the
 
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:32.650 align:start position:0%
from the agency officials staff of the
program

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
users or recipients of the program and
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders through interviews or
 
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.909 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders through interviews or
surveys

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
we test the accuracy of program data
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
when we need to we conduct file reviews
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
and we also try to write useful reports
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the audit and for legislative
 
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.249 align:start position:0%
for the audit and for legislative
oversight

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in statute that requires
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
an agency takes any actions on our
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.170 align:start position:0%
an agency takes any actions on our
recommendations

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
however there are executive orders that
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
require the agencies report to
 
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
transparency New Hampshire updates on
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
the audits that they've on the
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
how they fulfilled the uh the um
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
their uh recommendation our
 
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.089 align:start position:0%
their uh recommendation our
recommendations

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
now you have two things that are
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
important for this uh for this agency to
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
for this committee to do and one is to
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
um determine if the topic is suitable
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
for a performance audit
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
as prior members of the committee can
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
tell you they spend a lot of time
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
looking at a topic and deciding is this
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
worthy of a performance audit or is this
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
just a research question uh that you
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
know Senate research or house research
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
could answer if you have us do it it can
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
become very costly because of all the
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
um the other uh issue the other thing
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
you have to do is to decide what the
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
scope of the audit is going to be
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
now the scope of the audit defines the
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
extents and boundaries of what the
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
Auditors are going to examine
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh the number of elements go into this
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
including the question that you ask the
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
type of performance audit that you want
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
when the legislature wants the
 
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
when the legislature wants the
information

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
the availability of audit resources
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
what time period will be audited
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
do we need to sample do any samples that
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
are statistically valid
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
do we have access to complete and
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
accurate data
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
the size and complexity of the program
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
and the need to compare to other other
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
states programs around the country
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
the scope and the number of weaknesses
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
we uncover determine the size of our
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
reports and the time it takes to
 
00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.769 align:start position:0%
reports and the time it takes to
complete

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
complete
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
the size can also affect The Oddities
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
ability to deal with what we give them
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
recently we've had three audits that
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
have been over 300 pages one of them was
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
had 60 observations
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
where we looked at the entire agency
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
on the other end we've had audits that
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
just looked at the the medical cannabis
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
ID card and why it was taking so long to
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
be issued that ended up being a 30-page
 
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
report with a nine observations
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis report only took a thousand
 
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.550 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis report only took a thousand
hours

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
the Wetland Bureau took 11 000 hours
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
so the scope of the audit
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know is important to how much work
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
we do and how much time and resources we
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
put into it
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
so I'd just say keep that in mind
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
you know when you make your decisions
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's about it I don't know if
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
you have any other questions do you have
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
the handle questions nope you're good
 
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.949 align:start position:0%
the handle questions nope you're good
okay

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
well you do and I do but we do have new
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
people so let's introduce ourselves
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
starting with the senator from district
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
one Carrie gendro from district one and
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
district one I don't know if this would
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
be helpful or not but it encompasses 58
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
towns about 2500 square miles and it's
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
in Northern New Hampshire
 
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.090 align:start position:0%
in Northern New Hampshire

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.100 align:start position:0%

I have a I have a couple one um I mean
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
so you told us it couldn't range from a
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
thousand hours
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
to 11
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
000 hours how many
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
performance audits can you do a year
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
or do you do a year
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the size of those
 
00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:09.650 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the size of those
audits

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we have right now I think we have
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
three teams three audit teams that are
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
working we we have a new hire coming on
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I think July June
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
um so we've had a little we've had
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
trouble hiring uh it's been very slow
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
process taking many many months that
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
affects how many people are on the jobs
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
that we like to have at least one in
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
charge auditor and two staff we've been
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
doing some audits with just two people
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be starting one audit
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
right now with just one person uh who's
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
going to end up having using a financial
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
auditor for a few months as a staff so
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're able to to share some
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
resources uh between the financial and
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
performance side and occasionally we
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
also help the budget side during the
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
budget process I don't think we did it
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
this year but in past years they've
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
because that's where you know it's
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
really needed there so so about how many
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing this year past year
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
we do two
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
or three it's it's funny because they
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
could we had two giant reports that came
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
up two two of those 300 uh page reports
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
that came out on the same day and so not
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
you know we had a very slow year the
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
year before and then we ended up with
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
three two of those plus another one so
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
yeah again it's the size of the reports
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
if we're lucky a fast report is six
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
months one of those that like that
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
thousand hour unless we again if we put
 
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's a balancing act of what
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
resources we have and and what audits we
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess we'll have to keep that in
 
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.170 align:start position:0%
so I guess we'll have to keep that in
mind

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
um can we request Financial audits or
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
just performance audits
 
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.170 align:start position:0%
just performance audits
yes

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes the committee's responsibilities
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
just performance audits I mean certainly
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
um either through through my cane or
 
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.850 align:start position:0%
um either through through my cane or
myself

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
we we determine where we go on the
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
financial side but certainly where we
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
take input you know if there are areas
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
of concern things of that nature
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we can factor that into our
 
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.380 align:start position:0%
rotation we try to
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
depending upon the
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
findings that we have that I'm speaking
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
to the financial side now
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of material weaknesses
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies that we that we
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
uncover in one audit then chances are in
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
a few within five years we like to go
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
back to follow up with those
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
however if there weren't a lot of
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
significant issues then we may not go
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
back for 10 years
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
so and there are there are some we do
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
every year to support the State
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
financial audit and we also we also have
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
staff that support the single audit as
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
well so there's a lot of
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
our busy season is August through the
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
December because a lot of the staff is
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
supporting to keep
 
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.150 align:start position:0%
supporting to keep
um

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh professional accounting fees low as
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
well as give our staff the experience of
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
working with a national office and
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
things but like The Liquor Commission
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission we we have been doing
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
those every year so um okay so only
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
performance Audits and finally for for
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
people who are not on fiscal could you
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
explain what happens when uh recommended
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
is presented to the fiscal penny
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
sure when this committee let me go back
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
to the beginning when this committee
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
charges us with a topic they would like
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
like us to look at look like the first
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
one like excuse me weatherization
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
we uh we will draft a letter for the
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
chair to sign and that will go to fiscal
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal ultimately has to prove the topic
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
and once fiscal approves the topic then
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
it officially goes into our queue
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
and then we begin the process of scoping
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
it out based on our understanding of
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
what the committee has charged us with
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then we will come back to you with a
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
scope statement which we have one today
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
for you to approve which kind of
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
outlines what we plan to do we want to
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's in line with what
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
the committee wanted us to do
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and that begins the audit and then
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
typically other than a quick status if
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
if we have a meeting we we will provide
 
00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:41.660 align:start position:0%
that but once the audit is complete and
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
we will present it to the fiscal
 
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
we will present it to the fiscal
committee

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.490 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
and there will be agency Representatives
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
or Oddity representatives there to
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
respond to questions or respond to the
 
00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:53.570 align:start position:0%
respond to questions or respond to the
audit

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
so once um all of our work is non-public
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's confidential until such time is it
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee approves
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
accepts and approves
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the report for release to the public so
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
up until that time it's it's closely
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
held it's not public information
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
in order for the fiscal committee to not
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
approve a performance audit it has to be
 
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.220 align:start position:0%
a unanimous vote I believe so
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee so there are 10 members on
 
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.570 align:start position:0%
committee so there are 10 members on
fiscal

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
if one of them or even nine of them
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to do an audit
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
still gets done because it would have to
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
be all 10 members of fiscal
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
rep Weber and just
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear we don't see it
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
until after fiscal has accepted it too
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
right we don't we don't get we don't get
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
first grabbies no representative Weiler
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
has this wonderful statement about it's
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
you know if I heard what is it
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
I move that we accept the report place
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
it on file and release it in the usual
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
event there you go Senator Roswell I
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah thank you
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about how is there an
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the public to have input
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
about requesting certain audits do you
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
take those requests and then bring them
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
to us or is that's just something that
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
the public knows to bring to us if if we
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
are contacted directly then we will and
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
we believe it's a performance audit type
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
of a topic then we will forward that to
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for for your consideration
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
but certainly we prefer that in some
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
cases amongst the legislature that you
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
go through this committee through your
 
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.190 align:start position:0%
go through this committee through your
peers

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
peers
 
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.210 align:start position:0%
peers
um

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
so it's a combination of both but we
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
very rarely get someone contacting us
 
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.610 align:start position:0%
very rarely get someone contacting us
directly

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
but most of our topics I Believe come
 
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.850 align:start position:0%
but most of our topics I Believe come
from

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know build members legislature but
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
we probably hear
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
from kid institution yes yeah
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
occasionally we'll get a member that
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
will contact contact us directly
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
um a House member or Senator and we'll
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
forward them to this this committee and
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
in fact most of our topics will come
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
from from from you and you may hear it
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
from you know people in your you know
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
your voters and your people in your
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
districts or other members we also
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
present audits when asked to at other at
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
policy committees so we've done that in
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
the past
yes

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
and I would just add that uh in the
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
house at least we in the past I haven't
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
seen so many recently but in the past we
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
used to get several bills every year
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
requesting performance Audits and uh
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
when they came to a committee on which I
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
sat I always used to say gee we got this
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
other committee you could go there and
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
it could be put in line next time we
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
meet rather than waiting to pass a
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
statute and it just makes more sense
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
because this is the place where people
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh balance out the priorities for uh you
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
know you may have one very good idea but
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
there may be two or three more exigent
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
ones in front of us I'm remembering at
 
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:16.580 align:start position:0%
one point where we had a very emergency
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
audit of the veterans home oh yes uh I
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
remember because there were a number of
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
concerns raised from a number of
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
different directions and we felt that
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
that suddenly should leap ahead of many
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
of the things that were sitting before
 
00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:31.250 align:start position:0%
of the things that were sitting before
it

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this committee gets to
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
decide or you can tell us what which
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
audits you want first and you can also
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
you'll notice some some tabled audits
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
topics yes you get you can look at those
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
again you can decide if you want to keep
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
them table to put them in the put you
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
know or act on them and go forward or
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
take them off the table and and you know
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
suspend them or get all right not
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
suspend but basically delete them from
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
the table how generally how often does
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna say about five times it's when
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
we need you really or when you or when
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
you want that's great yeah or You have
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
topics and you want to attack monthly no
 
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.510 align:start position:0%
topics and you want to attack monthly no
no

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's at the call of the chair okay but
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
usually we will reach out when we need
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
the committee for a meeting but I'd say
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
last few years maybe three four times
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
right here okay any other questions
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
about the process and a referral morning
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you so you have I see you have
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
four that are tabled for uh on the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
topics do you currently have any artists
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
that you're working on right now that
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
will be the next section the status of
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
ongoing audits he was a good move to go
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
right in Segway Segway any other
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
questions about process
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right so please tell us about the
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
ones that are you're working on sure
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
so the weatherization assistance program
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
we've completed that and that was
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative fiscal last last month
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
you all should have received copies as
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
well as a link to the electronic version
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
the next one we're actually working on
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
is the mental health Workforce
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
requirements we're wrapping up our field
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
work on that
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
and we're about to begin observation and
 
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
Report drafting
 
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.370 align:start position:0%
Report drafting
um

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
one thing to keep in mind is that this
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
particular audit encompasses five
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
individual boards and they only meet
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
once a month
 
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.570 align:start position:0%
once a month
so

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
as we
 
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:37.700 align:start position:0%
as we go through the summer
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
our goal is to get a draft report to all
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
the boards by June but it's going to
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
take at least a couple of months for
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
process it act on it respond things of
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that nature so I think we're looking at
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
maybe uh at the earliest a fiscal
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
presentation in September for this
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
particular audit okay
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the next one special education dispute
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
resolution process uh we've completed
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
field work on that we're now actively or
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
in report and observation writing
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
um we hope to have a draft of that to
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
the department in late June July time
 
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.110 align:start position:0%
the department in late June July time
frame

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
the next one is the state oversight of
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
special education uh in a few minutes
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
you will consider the scope statement on
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
that one so that is the where we are
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
the next one Commission on human rights
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
we just began that we're actually in
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
communication with the director there to
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
try to schedule an entrance meeting so
 
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:42.860 align:start position:0%
we're just just beginning with that one
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the other topic just to make the
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee aware
 
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.630 align:start position:0%
committee aware
um

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
and as are as uh representative Weber
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned here's a situation where we
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
have a performance audit that was
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
dictated in statute so HP 1135 related
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
to the educational Freedom account that
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't become effective until October
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 so they basically the statue
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
wants a performance audit done but not
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
sometime after October 1st 2023 so
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's in our queue but not until later
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
so just to make the committee aware of
 
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.669 align:start position:0%
so just to make the committee aware of
that

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
so unless you have any questions on
 
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.730 align:start position:0%
so unless you have any questions on
those

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is move to the scope
 
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.409 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is move to the scope
statement

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:23.419 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
I know I'm going to ask the in charge
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
manager Steve Grady to come up and walk
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
you through that yes Senator Lane just
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
real quick on that last item HB 1135
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're not starting it
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
until after October 1st that's when
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
you're going to start though that's
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
correct we should get it sometime the
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
following year
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you depending upon we have
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to decide where after of
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
October 1st did
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
fits into
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
the schedule
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
sure yeah we're not gonna we're gonna
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's there as a placeholder for our
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
scheduling purposes so the earliest that
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to begin it will be October
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
okay if that's the if that's the
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
direction but certainly the committee
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
again it's in statute so we have to act
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
on it but again the committee can
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
re-prioritize start it until October
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay it's great
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
and with the corollary to that be that
 
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
at some time prior to October 1st ask
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
you to start it October 1st is that
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
is that within our power do we have to
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
wait until after October 1st to vote on
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
it at all
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's it the effective date of the step
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill is October 1st 20. oh I see
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
okay so got it so it sounds like we
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
brought it would have to wait yep thank
 
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.470 align:start position:0%
brought it would have to wait yep thank
you

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we looked at
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
so uh Steve grade is in charge and he'll
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
come up and walk you through the but
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
also commissioner Elder Blue from

approved a request from this body to
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
conduct a performance audit of the

the provision of special education
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
the topic was Broad and also it assumed
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we would subdivide that topic and
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
we have done that you heard earlier
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%

talking about now is the second audit
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
from that request that this committee
 
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.510 align:start position:0%
from that request that this committee
made

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
according to Department data there were
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
nearly 31 000 special education students
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as of October 2022 over
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
91 million dollars was budgeted for
 
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:01.460 align:start position:0%
special education in state fiscal years
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2022.
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
federal laws and regulations created a
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework with broad
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%

the state special education program was
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
required to comply with them
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
State also had flexibility to determine
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
how to comply with procedural
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%

Federal requirements and added to them
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
the state special education program was
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
expected to protect special education

education services to eligible students
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state's framework
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
the Board of Education had a governance

goals and these goals were primarily
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
procedural compliance or near-term

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
our proposed autoscope is how effective
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
was the Department's General supervision

and state advisory committee meetings
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to obtain perspectives from

management controls and other relevant
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
manners outside the audit period when

they affect program operations during
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
and after the audit period
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to examine board State

advisory committee and other agencies
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%

program
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
we will not among other things directly
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
audit local agencies compliance with
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%

requirements
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
we anticipate completing this audit and
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
presenting the final report to the
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%

2024.
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions for me at this
 
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions for me at this
point

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:00.620 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions if that's okay
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
but the first one leads to this
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
statement at the very beginning of the
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
document the state's special education
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
programs was expected to prepare special
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
education students for one further
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
education two employment and three
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
independent living is there any
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
expectation of the day audit will look
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
into whether these goals are being
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
achieved yes
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.089 align:start position:0%
achieved yes
great

00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
that's number one um and then an easy
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
one I don't know if this is relevant or
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
not to the actual audit but it'd be very
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
helpful to know how much total span not
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
right now but in general how much total
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
spending is done by the local of school
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
districts or the non-federal grants but
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know with what what schools have in
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
their budgets basically as a sum across
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state because I think it's
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
substantially if I'm not mistaken more
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
way more than what
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state is yeah I believe that the
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
localities spend the vast majority of
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
the dollars expended on the state
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
special education program thank you but
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
am I right in thinking this is going to
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
be one of our larger audits yes so this
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
is at the 11 000 an hour type yes
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully not 11 000 but uh it could I
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean how big a team do you
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
currently there are two of us decide
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
full time to the project with a third uh
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
expected to join us full-time probably
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
in another four weeks or so so we'll
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
have a total of three working on it for
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
of course but a special ed has a lot of
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
federal law attached to it also and
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
likely a a lot of sort of federal
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
overview and supervision so I'm
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
wondering to the extent that you all
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
will review uh sort of the requirements
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
and federal law for the Department of
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
Education and perhaps even look at any
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
reviews that the federal department of
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
education has conducted or not conducted
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
more questions Senator Brown
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm just doing some quick math in my
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
head here if this is a 10 000 hour audit
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
you only have three people on it you're
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
like three years before this is done is
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
am I doing my math correctly it probably
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
will not be ten thousand hours but the
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
estimates do you have us taking it
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
through uh the first quarter of calendar
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
year 2024 at this point okay thank you
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add I mean sometimes the
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
resources we have available affects how
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
much how deep we can go on any topic and
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of a normal part of
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
the or when we do audits I mean if you
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a big team you can do a lot of work
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and we can dig down really deep other
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
times you know we have to also think
 
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.950 align:start position:0%
times you know we have to also think
about

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know if you spend a year on an audit
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know is that that's a long time and
 
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't need to go down to
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
the you know looking for the penny you
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
know it's it's the bigger issues are we
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
can we find early on and it's really
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
documenting you know the problems there
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh so it's it's Balancing Act of you
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
know how much time we spend on every
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
audit I mean if you've let Auditors go
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
we'd go we could spend a lot of time on
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
every program every audit
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
how many people do you have in the audit
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
division uh for performance audits we
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
have 10. so it's not huge not huge and
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
you got three audits so you can do you
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
know you see why you know it's we're
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
lucky we get three people on an audit
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we pull in someone just for
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
a short time like someone's free for a
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
month or two and if the audit you know
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
there may be one part of the audit they
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think we're even doing that right
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
now with a financial auditor oh no you
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
and I know yeah as I recall having
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
looked at a lot of audits over the years
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
most of the observations don't require
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
to fix them
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
well you're correct yeah some of them
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
will will suggest the legislature may
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
wish to consider legislative act or
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
we'll tell the agency
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
you could you know do what the law says
 
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
you could you know do what the law says
or

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
change the law I mean that that's you
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
know we're compliant so we're going to
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
say loss is this you're not doing you're
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
not doing that you know first easiest
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
thing is to do it but it also could be
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
that there's something you know there's
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
an old law it doesn't make sense it's
 
00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
also a time for the agency to come
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
forward to the legislature and say hey
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Auditors found this and we've
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
purchased it the costly requirement we
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
don't need to do this as a better way of
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
doing you know doing that
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
and we're presented with things that are
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
really more urgent
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
urgent when we get the audit reports the
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah when you have significant
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency you have 40 observations an
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
agency cannot just do them all at once
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
they have to we talk about strategic
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
planning we hope that they take these
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
audits they bring they think about what
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
can we do what needs to be done right
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
away usually it's the law says to do
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
things you ought to be in compliance and
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
then you start worrying about being
 
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.589 align:start position:0%
then you start worrying about being
efficient

00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you're effective all you
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
know that's that's the important goal
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
making sure the program is doing what is
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be supposed to be doing
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
the court and acting within the the law
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the Auditors
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
because the Commissioners here I'm sure
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
he wants to speak to the proposed scope
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
before we take any action
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
commissioner

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Frank Ada
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
blue Commissioner of Education
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
um so I chose to come and speak to this
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
scope statement today because I want to
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
make sure that we achieve the objective
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
that we have set out relative to this
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
particular audit some of you who are
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
around last year remember Senator Reagan
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
who was a champion of this working very
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
hard to make sure that this state
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
and when I say the state I mean all
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
public entities involved are doing their
 
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.349 align:start position:0%
public entities involved are doing their
um

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
their best to make sure that we're
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
serving the needs of some of our most
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations in the state aka
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
some of our students with disabilities
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
the scoping was driven largely by uh
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
very concerned and active parents of
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities who came in
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
and expressed their concern that the
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
system was not serving them well
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Whitley has pointed out
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of rules particularly
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
Federal rules around this so there's and
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and was already mentioned here this is
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
the second audit in this particular area
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
I will let me just talk about that first
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
one which is around the dispute
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
resolution and I and I didn't I mean
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
I've expressed my concerns internally
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
but I hadn't expressed them to the
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee relative to that scope but
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
when we scope these audits we need to
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
make sure we scope it to get to the
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
underlying problem
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
and as an example in the dispute
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
resolution resolution audit
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
we are working with a population of
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
transactions so our sampling
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
of transactions that we're working with
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
are those uh
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
interactions between the the school
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
district generally and the family who is
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with whatever is happening
 
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.089 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with whatever is happening
there

00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that ultimately rise to the level of
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
reaching a dispute resolution
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
what is excluded in that process and is
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
widely known in this in the education
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
community and the special education
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
community in particular
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
is that a school district who generally
 
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:09.740 align:start position:0%
is armed with some very capable lawyers
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
and parents who are generally Pro Se
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
arguing and advocating for their
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
children when the school district
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
perceives that they're going to lose
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
right they've they've done some things
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
happened and they won't be successful in
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
some type of a you know a legal type of
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
a process they settle
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
they they result in a mediated
 
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.069 align:start position:0%
they they result in a mediated
settlement

00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
gets sealed locally never shows up at
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't show up on any of
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
the sampling plans and so a lot of
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are coming to share
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
their concerns with Senator Reagan and
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
other legislators
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
are subject to a process that would not
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
even fall inside the scope of some of
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
this audit activity that we do
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
now I want to turn to the current audit
 
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:03.140 align:start position:0%
um and again here I have concerns that
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
that the scoping of this work may not
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
get us to the answer that we're looking
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
for right it will feel good we'll do an
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
audit we'll look at all kinds of ins and
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
outs and we're happy to look at all of
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
our procedures but at the end of the day
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
we want to answer the relevant question
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is you raised a
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
question about the scope of this audit
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
and again the scope statement indicates
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
that there's 90 million dollars of funds
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
that are spent on special education
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
can I just tell you that that is a gross
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
Distortion in terms of how much is being
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
spent by the state and we did ask the
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
audit team to include a broader scope so
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
that had context you know when we talk
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
about 90 million dollars most of those
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
funds are passed through that are
 
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.710 align:start position:0%
funds are passed through that are
incorporating

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
incorporating
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
idea funds as well as special education
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
Aid right it's about seven million
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
dollars that is retained by the agency
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of administration that's 90
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
that what that doesn't include is all of
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out the local spending
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
which is over or close to 900 million
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars right so we're going to audit a
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
small portion of this what it also
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't include is the adequacy the
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid funds that go into
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
special education so I'm not sure that
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
we've completely encapsulated the full
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
scope of activity relative to this audit
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a it's an urgent audit
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree right we've got
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
families that the system is not serving
 
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
families that the system is not serving
well

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
and so by scoping the audit as it has
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
been scoped and and we totally
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the agency is you know
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're Limited in what they can do like
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
well if you're task to scope an audit
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
you Scope one that that you can take
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
care of right but if you're only looking
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
at a subset of the old the overall thing
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
are you really answering the question
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
that was asked to begin with
 
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
that was asked to begin with
um

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
I think as well uh just like the in the
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution audit in this work
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
there's a misperception that somehow the
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
agency is a pass-through entity can
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
somehow affect I mean we can have a
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
little bit of influence but can we
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
affect what's happening on the ground
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
for families and children in the state
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in the school districts
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they are what they are
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
experiencing whether or not goals of
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
individual education programs are being
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
achieved whether or not the school is
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
focused on making sure that those
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
children can be successful you know our
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
our enforcement activities sometimes
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
feel like a paper tiger I have to sign
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
complaint letters that I get and
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's just a procedural defect
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
right like I mean I can tell you actual
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
examples you know a student gets an IEP
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
and they say that they are going to be
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
receiving in that IEP this is just one
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
that came up in the last month you know
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
this student will have an Extended
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity in their IEP to get
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
them some work related experience
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
well you know what it didn't the student
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
has been the entire year and we haven't
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
seen any action on that and the response
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
from the district is well the IEP
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify when it has to happen
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
meaning it could happen on the last week
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
of school and somehow that's going to be
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay right so you know like we're
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here I'm wanting to say like
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
that's not what the intent was the
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
intent was to get this child the
 
00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:31.849 align:start position:0%
intent was to get this child the
experiences

00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
um but sometimes the rules and the
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
regulations don't allow that type of uh
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
of lean in in that particular case
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's a federal rule that we can't do
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
but I guess what I would I'm coming to
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
you today just make sure that I I
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
advocate for a scope of an audit that's
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
going to answer the Germaine question of
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
making sure that students with
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities are getting the best
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
possible services that they can and
 
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
I think it's partially a question and
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
partially comment and I'm seeking to
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
understand if I'm hearing you correctly
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
because much of what I was hearing you
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
say particularly in your introductory
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
remarks had to do with the cost of
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
special education and performance audits
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
are not to do with the cost and they're
 
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:25.700 align:start position:0%
not even
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily as I understand it and I'm
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
glad to be corrected to do with
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh efficient use of funds although I
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
think that comes into it tangentially it
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
seems to me that what we have here is
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
an actual what we're looking at as the
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
scope statement stands now
 
00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:49.970 align:start position:0%
scope statement stands now
is

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
the interaction of
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
your Department's supervision
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
with all these Myriad plans and rules
 
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.069 align:start position:0%
with all these Myriad plans and rules
and

00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:01.970 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
although I would love to think of a way
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
of doing that more narrowly I can't and
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like anybody else has
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
either but I guess I I would want to
 
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:15.260 align:start position:0%
just say
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
when when you came to your conclusion
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
which is we want to know we're doing the
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
best job which is certainly the goal of
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
all of us uh
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not sure that's the goal of
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
a performance audit because my
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
understanding is uh that actually
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
they're intended
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
to see whether you're doing the job you
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
were told to do by Statute Rule and
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
other regulatory things and
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
than the corollary to that is does it
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
make sense to do this this way and do we
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
need to make changes
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that or have I
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
gotten that wrong so I I appreciate the
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
comments but I and I also agree that
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
this is a performance audit and it's not
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
a financial audit but the finances
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
dictate where much of that performance
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
takes place and so what I would say is
 
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
that the way that we've scoped this
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
audit which carves out a substantive
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
amount of the performance right so this
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
audit doesn't include looking at how are
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
these students being served in our
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
school systems where the bulk of the
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
service is being provided knock
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
yourselves out you can audit away over
 
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
here at our 10 percent and some of our
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
processes influence the school but the
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
performance by and large takes place in
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
that local Lea and so even if there was
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
just a both end like let's look at some
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
of the school districts let's let's
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
reach outside of ourselves if that's
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
where much of the performance is taking
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
place to see what those interactions
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
look like to see how those schools are
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
supporting their students because I
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
agree with you it's a performance audit
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
and much of that performance takes place
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of the department
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so I just that's my so I think we're
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
saying we're in vmint agreement relative
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.609 align:start position:0%
to that
representative

00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
no I think it's very important that we
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
do look at how the the costs are done
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
because it's the only way you can really
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
assess this and
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's this it's this three and a
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
half times the average cost per pupil
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
which is about 75 000 and then it's 20
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
for the Local District and 80 percent
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
for the state until we get to 10 times
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
or roughly 200 000 and then the state
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
pays the rest of it and I think those
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
are very important things when you're
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
looking at the management one that has
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
always Disturbed me is when the The
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
Local District says we've spent seventy
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
thousand and three thousand of that is
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
this fund
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
and perhaps another twenty or thirty
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
thousand was Medicaid we've never been
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
able everybody hides behind HIPAA
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
and doesn't give us the true cost of how
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
much Medicaid fund the local district
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
has taken credit for that you don't know
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
you just get this we've spent seventy
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
thousand give me more and
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
they maybe they didn't spend seventy
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
thousand of local funds maybe they just
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
spent half that and so I think that's an
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
important aspect that's part of this in
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
my mind of looking at the scope of this
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
statement seeing how all the funds are
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
divided and I hope we can get more
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
information on HIPAA or not HIPAA but
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funds because it's always
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
avoided even if we just had it in total
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
like special ed includes 100
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
000 100 million of of Medicaid funds we
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
ought to know that because we're paying
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
for that in another place
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that's an important part
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
maybe that's maybe it's more than they
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
they want to take on the scope but I
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
think I would like to know it from a
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
from an aspect of auditing so where's
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
the real money coming from and it is
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
like you say huge amounts a lot more
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
than this 90 million that we're reading
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
here so anyway I'm hoping that can be
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
included Senator Bentley yeah I you know
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just sort of thinking about scope
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
and what is actually doable and I think
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm hearing is your desire
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
to sort of expand it to look at you know
 
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the Lea level and I
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
think you know while that would be
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
valuable information that would be
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
impossible to do to look at every Lea
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
and so what I think that this committee
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
needs to sort of focus on is the scope
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
of you know this audit is supposed to
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
look at the department of education's
 
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:33.970 align:start position:0%
look at the department of education's
um

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:33.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency or you know ability to to
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
conduct their monitoring enforcement of
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know these requirements right we're
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the department you know are
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
there policy the appropriate policies in
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
place to adequately meet their
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement requirements
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
like so I think that has to be that has
 
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
to be sort of the focus here because
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
they are you know there's very
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements for monitoring
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
and enforcement within federal law and
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
state law and I think that that needs to
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
remain the focus because I think whether
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
the um leas are appropriately spending
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
money and how much sort of flows from
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
that so I think it's more appropriate to
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
look within the department rather than
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
going to the leas and you know if if
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
you're doing your job the way that it's
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
required in federal law they I think the
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
Auditors will be able to see you know
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
whether that that the leas are acting
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately so if I just might respond
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
I mean so I was not advocating that we
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
audit all of the leas but in auditing we
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
have a an approach called Sam length
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
right so it is possible to sample leas
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
and understand better what is happening
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
in that sample of leas that's I guess
 
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying relative to the scope is
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
that it really I think you're missing
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
something if you don't go beyond it's a
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
little bit like the dispute resolution
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
like we're we've we've made a selection
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
of transactions to audit but we sampled
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
out of 10 of the transactions rather
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
than the whole pie of transactions and
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to reach a conclusion about
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
a population of transactions when we've
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
only looked at a subset you're going to
 
00:54:09.609 --> 00:54:09.619 align:start position:0%
run into the same problem I believe here
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to reach conclusions
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
about what's happening with where the
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
bulk of the performance is taking place
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
you'll try to reach conclusions and you
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
will have only looked at a very narrow
 
00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:23.870 align:start position:0%
subset of what's actually happening
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:27.290 align:start position:0%

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hartman is doing its job in terms of
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
fulfilling those requirements that
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
sampling wouldn't be necessary because
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
it would already be in the review of
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
what you are doing in your department so
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:42.980 align:start position:0%
there are questions
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
represented thanks Senator do you have
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations you can provide
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
the committee in terms of how you would
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
see extending the
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
the scope we have here so we're happy to
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
work with the lva in terms of trying to
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
design a scope that includes a both and
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a singular approach those
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
were conversations that we did have with
 
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.849 align:start position:0%
were conversations that we did have with
the

00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
um the uh LBA prior to this
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to engage in those
 
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
conversations with them so we're using
 
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.069 align:start position:0%
conversations with them so we're using
jaywood

00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
number of districts
 
00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:21.859 align:start position:0%
to see the interaction of the department
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
and the local school district and
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the performance in the local
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
school district in terms of meeting
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
again there's this body of you know
 
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.950 align:start position:0%
again there's this body of you know
regulatory

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.549 align:start position:0%
regulatory
um

00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh schema that is you know
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
required to be complied with and again
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have a role in that performance and
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
the Lea has a role in that performance
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
and is really a both end
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't be
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
looking to do a performance on it of the
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
leas because
 
00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
leas because
we

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
can't why can't well we can really do is
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
look at did the department do meat its
 
00:56:07.809 --> 00:56:07.819 align:start position:0%
regulation requirements
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
in how it interacted
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
with leas and so and I was at Point
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley was trying to bring up
 
00:56:20.049 --> 00:56:20.059 align:start position:0%
right that if you're meeting those
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
requirements then why would we sample
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
and that's in fact what the fiscal
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
committee approved was
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
to conduct a performance audit of the
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness of the
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
Department of education's oversight of
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
the provision of so so I think you would
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that if we would
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
broaden the scope we would have to go
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
back to the fiscal committee because
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
they were pretty prescriptive in their
 
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.690 align:start position:0%
they were pretty prescriptive in their
approval

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
I just have a a comment that kind of
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
meshes I think with Senator Whitley's
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
uh coming from small rural communities
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
rather than large urban communities I
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
think in order to have any kind of
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
Representative sampling
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
of how we're doing on the local level
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
we would need a lot more time and a lot
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
more Personnel than we have available to
 
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:22.750 align:start position:0%
more Personnel than we have available to
us

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh before we could actually get a
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative sampling of school
 
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.430 align:start position:0%
representative sampling of school
districts

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
because as we all know uh the Manchester
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
and Nashua districts are nothing like
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Fall Mountain School District
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin commissioner how
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
does your department uh
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh address that issue now do you have
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
people who actually go out and look at
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
the local operations we do do some
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring for the various districts it
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of a paper tiger in terms of
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of limitations on what we
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
can say what we can lean in on and even
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
we suffer from the we have no access to
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
these mediated settlements that take
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
place in the district so if there is an
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
issue and and a district decides to
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
settle that locally then that's out of
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
our hands and we don't see any kind of
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
an infraction so even if I'm monitoring
 
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
a district I'm not going to see that and
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
so I may I myself May reach an incorrect
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion in that process wouldn't that
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
be part of the dispute resolution as if
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
it gets to a dispute resolution okay but
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's the point is these are taking
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
place these happen these are settle long
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
before they get into that process so
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
again we're we're looking at a subset of
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
what state in place and reaching a
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
conclusion about the totality of it
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
which may be what was the the parents
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
who came to this committee and expressed
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
their concerns and the fiscal committee
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
Express their concerns are trying to say
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
like hey over here you're not hearing us
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
right and so I think that the objective
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
of this audit in my recollection of
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
sitting through those committee hearings
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
I think you were I think you were part
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
of that right there was a lot of concern
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
about you know how these um these things
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think for for Mr
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
Henry Mr Grady
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
to make a full-rounded report have a few
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
tables showing things like the the
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
formula three and a half times ten times
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
eighty percent so on and what I haven't
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
seen in quite a while is the very
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
numerous list of what an IEP is for I
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
mean I remember being seeing things like
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
anxiety which may or may not affect the
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
real academic achievement and and they
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
keep adding new things and I've been a
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
while since I've really seen a list do
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how many there are
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
there could be a hundred I do we have a
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
very discreet list of diagnoses yeah but
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's very extensive it's just been
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
so long since I've seen a complete list
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I think to have a rounded report at
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
least show the list even though you
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't don't have to go down and and
 
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
cover each one but there's some of them
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
that that seem a little strange to even
 
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
even be included in an IEP thank you and
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you letting me come in and
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
share my concerns about the scope
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:32.059 align:start position:0%
um if the goals are to further education
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
employment and independent living those
 
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:39.500 align:start position:0%
last two seem almost
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
retrospective like you wouldn't really
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
know until the end of someone's
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
High School career yeah well really all
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
of them whether they were furthering
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
their education whether they were
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
employed or living independently and
 
01:01:02.289 --> 01:01:02.299 align:start position:0%
those actions might take some
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
transition and time so get some curious
 
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:11.660 align:start position:0%
for the lva how would you measure
 
01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
for the lva how would you measure
those

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.250 align:start position:0%
those
three

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:15.260 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.210 align:start position:0%
three
goals

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
goals
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
manager Steve Brady again
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
um coming up Steve
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
so in IEP planning at the age of 14
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
years IEP teams are supposed to plan uh
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
students transition it is supposed to
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
include whatever objectives that
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
individual has in mind so whether it's
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
further education
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
employment and then an underlying
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
Independent Living so starting at the
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
age of 14 IEP should be moving a student
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
towards those goals
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and yes they transition out of the
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
program in any number of ways some may
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
drop out some may graduate some may then
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
go into subsequent education settings
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
they may go get a job afterwards they
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
and hopefully are getting uh moving
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
towards independent living
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
there is a survey that the department
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
does of post
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
program exiting students that measures
 
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
both education and employment in some
 
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
respects there are some methodological
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to that survey and
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
only gets to I think we were told maybe
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
two percent of the population and there
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of mechanical problems with
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
getting the survey to everybody that we
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
would like to see get that survey and it
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
is done once uh one year after they
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
leave the program and then
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
never again so systematically
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
it is something that is of a concern but
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
we do have procedural control concerns
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
around that so you're you're audit would
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
how the survey was administered how many
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
people responded
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay we expect to look at the life cycle
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
of a student's engagement with the
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
special education program so we expect
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
to pick that up somewhere around the age
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
of 14 look at the transition see what's
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
monitored with respect to transition
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
planning on the state level at the state
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
level yep because every every
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction most jurisdictions report
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
dated at the state if the state's
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
collecting those data we'll look at it
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
if the state's not collecting relevant
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
data we'll have something to say about
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
it and suggest that they actually
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think it might benefit the
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
as we're talking about the scope I think
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
that this committee would benefit from
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
looking at the federal requirements of
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
the sca the Department of Education
 
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.930 align:start position:0%
the sca the Department of Education
because

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
Ida which is the federal you know
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
special ed law place is pretty strict
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
requirements or responsibilities for
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement of the local
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
communities places that with the
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and so if I
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
think we it would help us understand
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
what the doe may already have in their
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
possession in terms of monitoring leas
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
if we saw that those requirements that
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be a suggestion of mine is that
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
something Nick you could provide us yeah
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
I assume that that would already be part
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner this I'm new to the board
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
here and I'm just trying to make sure
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding what you're asking is
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the audit scope as you know
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
how effective was the Department's
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
General supervision of the state's
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
special education program in producing
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes and from what I'm
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
understanding you're saying is this is
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
more of a partnership with you and the
 
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:37.940 align:start position:0%
districts themselves in achieving those
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes and it seems that
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a little bit more
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
depth in the scope here to make sure
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
that you're achieving those expected
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
outcomes and you don't feel that we have
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
quite enough in here to really gauge
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
that I worry that when we scope these
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
audits we scope them such that we're not
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually answering the the Salient
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
question which is the customer that's
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
being served and so we have a sampling
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
of convenience because this is what we
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
can cover my objective was none other
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
today was none other than to come in and
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
share with you my concerns about the
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
scope but assuming that the audit would
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
be conduct you know be going forward
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
um you know as an example you know what
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the scope statement when we
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
first got the scope statement relative
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
to those goals it said you know to make
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
sure that all these students had
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
post-secondary and would say well that's
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
not really the goal for these kids so we
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
expanded it working with the LBA to say
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
like no there's much broader goals for
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
these students right so again just you
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
know because if we I mean initially a
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
scope statement said to make sure that
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
every student is prepared for
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
post-secondary well some of these kids
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
are not going to do post-secondary and
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's not even the best pathway for
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
them so I want to make sure we don't
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
have kind of a a scope statement of
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
convenience because if that was your
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
scope statement and they came back and
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
said well the eight percent of the kids
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
went to post-secondary well that wasn't
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
even the goal for these kids right so we
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
have to make sure we get a scope
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
statement that answers the question that
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
the families of New Hampshire are asking
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's what I'm after a while
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the things that that I think
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
is is a success in special ed and it's a
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
note that I've seen through the years as
 
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
far more special ed in elementary
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
schools than there is in the later
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
grades and it's all due to not learning
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
to read
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
and so once that student gets gets uh
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
IEP for reading
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
and they really learned to read which
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
they maybe didn't learn in the first few
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
grades then suddenly they're a regular
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
student and it's the success of the
 
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:38.180 align:start position:0%
program we want all our kids reading yes
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
we wish they were all that easy yeah
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang thank you and I apologize
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
for missing some of the meetings of this
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
got asked I apologize I'm asking it
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
again so I I like said on the Pearl I am
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
concerned about that producing expected
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes statement in line
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
um because it's as I read this it seems
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
like it's related to the top part of the
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
page it talks about
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the department functioned as a pass
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
through entity for federal grants that
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
made through sub grants the local ages
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
it had to and it has about eight or ten
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
bullet points there that are basically
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
about the management of the federal
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
grants but doesn't talk about the
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
individual student right it doesn't have
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
the outcomes about the individual
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
student so I'm trying to understand is
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
this audit scope about the fact that
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
you've managed the money properly you've
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
done the Performance Management right
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
you've issued you've done everything but
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
you can't get down to the bottom detail
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
date of the student and the outcomes of
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
the student which so that word outcomes
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
is I guess my question what are we
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
measuring here as we look at this we're
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
looking at how the agency has managed
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
special education dollars and did it
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
make its way down given the leas saying
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
this is what we're doing right and
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
you've audited that because one of the
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
things in here is monitor the operations
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
of local agencies and it's a test to see
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
are you in fact monitoring but again it
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't get down to student outcomes
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's about the outcomes of the dollars
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the management of the dollars and
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
the management of getting it to the
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
students again I just I worry having sat
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
through some of the meetings relative to
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
the scoping of this audit and the
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with Senator Reagan and
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
the conversations with the families that
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
were coming in
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
the goal was that we had families who
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
didn't believe that their interests were
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
being served by a bureaucracy and so I
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
don't want to go say like well the
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy did everything it was
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for if the students haven't
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
the even larger sampling that we're
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
ignoring in that question
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
is all the families who aren't
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
complaining and who feel that they have
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
been well served
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
so there's that
 
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.169 align:start position:0%
so there's that
um

01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering first of all sometimes
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we have these meetings
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
suddenly a number of audits have wrapped
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
up and you're looking immediately for
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
more work
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
my first question is is it am I correct
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
in sensing that you have plenty of work
 
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
to be going on with at this point with
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
respect to this audit no I I mean with
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the other other audits that
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
are going on to defer to somebody else
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
but I I've been working on this
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
particular subject since November of
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
2022 in order to prepare this statement
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
and you you so I'm gathering that your
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
perspective as you'd like to proceed
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
forward with all deliberate speak I
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
would like to proceed forward with
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
whatever's going to satisfy this
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee's questions okay I need to do
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
something different I would
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I was trying to figure out whether we
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
have some time to
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
think about all the new things that have
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
been brought up because this is a very
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
different group of people than the ones
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
who approved the statement
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and while I don't want to slow
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
anybody down I don't want to rush it
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
either so I'm trying to figure out uh in
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the context of what we can do today
 
01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.150 align:start position:0%
the context of what we can do today
um

01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
whether what we really want to do is
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
Full Speed Ahead and I'm I'm actually
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
relatively comfortable with that but but
 
01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:07.460 align:start position:0%
willing to be persuaded otherwise
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
because my
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
my perception is that what we were
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.890 align:start position:0%
talking about
was

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
looking most specifically about how the
 
01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.590 align:start position:0%
looking most specifically about how the
department

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.370 align:start position:0%
department
interacts

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
interacts
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
with those it's supervising
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and we were not planning nor I think can
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
we appropriately with the staff we have
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
unless we want to employ a lot of other
 
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.970 align:start position:0%
unless we want to employ a lot of other
Auditors

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:36.980 align:start position:0%
Auditors
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
make any kind of a comprehensive
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation of how individual students
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
needs are being met and the percentage
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
of students whose needs are being met so
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
I I was comfortable with the scope as we
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
approved it I'm still comfortable but if
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
there are tweaks that the committee
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
wants to suggest
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to listen to them
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley uh Madam chair I'm also
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a scope and that's only
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
because I know that federal law is is
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
very specific that they place the
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility of monitoring and
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement of our leas on the doe and
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
so what what I think the committee is
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
interested in should be already
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
available if the Dewey is appropriately
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
doing their monitoring as required by
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
federal law so that's why I think this
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
scope is appropriate because it should
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
already be there representative
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
so I have a very different perception
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
um having been with the committee when
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
the prior chairman who was the one that
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
was requesting this uh
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
was speaking to it and it much more
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
closely matches what we're hearing from
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and that is what are
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
the results why are why was he getting
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
all these complaints regarding special
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
education specifically from parents
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
related to their children
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
I understand the issue of trying to get
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
to all of the children would be a very
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
big problem but during the presentation
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
that the LBA gave here
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
they specifically stated that these
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
performance audits relate to past
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
performance analysis
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
and that users can be included in the
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
in the analysis
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
so it certainly would seem reasonable to
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
me in fact I would expect it that they
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
would be talking to these
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
but the parents and the children
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
how have they perceived proceed and how
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
the outcomes continued past I don't know
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
what whether I say high school or
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I say but beyond this period of
 
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
time we're talking about what about the
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
kids that are the folks that have been
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
filed for five years where are they in
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
terms of this life cycle and where are
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
the parents or caregivers and how are
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
they seeing the process and has it
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
gotten better or worse or whatever so I
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
would very much like to see that at
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
least at some level that we would hear
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
more than just I'm sure they want to
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
know that the department is doing
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
everything correct per federal law but I
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
sat on the finance committee on our town
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I was on the school board part of it
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
and the biggest black hole
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
is with special education and I do
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be helpful if we
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
started to dig into it at the whole
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
level not just are we obeying the
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
federal law especially the federal law
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh you can obey the federal law as it
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
was sort of implied here and still not
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
get any good results out of the other
 
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.729 align:start position:0%
get any good results out of the other
end

01:13:45.729 --> 01:13:45.739 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that clarification and what
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
really thank you madam chair and what I
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
was saying is that you know I fully
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you and I think that
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
information is very valuable but I guess
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
my point was if the department was doing
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
like complying with Federal requirements
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
about monitoring they should have
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
already looked into those parents
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
complaints and looked into those budgets
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
that didn't work so I'm saying that the
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
information should already be there if
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're doing their work appropriately
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
I guess where I'm struggling on the
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
scope statement is with the two words in
 
01:14:20.699 --> 01:14:21.890 align:start position:0%
scope statement is with the two words in
producing

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
producing
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
because the department can only do
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
its part the local districts have to do
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
their parts
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
and the federal government has to do its
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
part so for me
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
the words in producing is it's giving I
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
think the department more power than it
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
actually has so I'm not sure those two
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
words are right representative Weber
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just reading what what you're going
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
to do with this and it seems to me that
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
a great deal of what I think I'm hearing
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative say are included under
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
the bullet points on page three of
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
obtain perspective from stakeholders
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
outside the department
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
and observe board and Sac meetings
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
do those not
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
sort of the end the end results and also
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the the work done the incorporation
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
of the work done by the committee to
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
study special education dispute
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
resolution options
 
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.530 align:start position:0%
resolution options
uh

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
do those not help us get
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
towards including in this the kinds of
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
interactions that representative erf is
 
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
they do created to advise the
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner on special education it is
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
also specifically composed of parents it
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be a forum for airing
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
concerns that Gap that the commissioner
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
has referenced of things that don't
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
manifest themselves in the Department's
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
radar those kinds of things should flow
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
through the state advisory committee if
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state advisory committee is working
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
correctly and providing the input that
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
it needs to
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
then the department should be well
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
informed as to the concerns that the
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
program may be facing if that committee
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
is not working well then we have a
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
systemic defect because that committee
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
can contribute to not just one or two or
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
a handful of students or local
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
educations efficiency and Effectiveness
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
but to the systems efficiency and
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness affecting 175 local
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and 31 000 students and
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's the locus of control in this
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
relationship that the federal government
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
has with the state and the locals
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
everything flows through the department
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
and to have 90 million dollars budgeted
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
at the state and to suggest that 900
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars is the real number we
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
should be looking at
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
is a little bit misleading because that
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
90 million dollars or that seven and a
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
half million dollars that's budgeted for
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
Department operations controls
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
the results of that 900 million dollars
 
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
and that's why we've chosen to scope
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
this audit the way it has because it's
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
going to have the broadest effect that
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
it possibly can because we cannot audit
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
175 localities we have statutory
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on the number of localities
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
we can actually look at in any amount of
 
01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:19.430 align:start position:0%
we can actually look at in any amount of
time

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
moreover we cannot individually review
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
31 000 IEPs we can't even take a sample
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
of 31 000 IEPs and do that in any time
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's practical so to hopefully address
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
some of your concerns we have targeted
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
targeted this audit to focus and the key
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
State control and that is the department
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
and its operation of the program
 
01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.490 align:start position:0%
and its operation of the program
but

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:45.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
it might be an over and overstatement
 
01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.850 align:start position:0%
it might be an over and overstatement
produce

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
produce
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
those extra outcomes and that's where
 
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling on this well and the
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
department is sorry the department is
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
obligated to take a look at the data
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
that he gets back and produce empirical
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
results from the data that it's
 
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
collecting from the jurisdictions to
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
identify successful and unsuccessful
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
approaches so if the department is doing
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
that correctly it should be identifying
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
good approaches at transition planning
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
for 14 through 21 year 22 year olds if
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's not collecting data on that then
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's a gap in the control framework if
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's not what we're seeing that
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
performance well then that's another Gap
 
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the control framework so that's again
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we're we're targeting it
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
where we're targeting it
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang so again I I guess I'm okay
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
with this going forward just with the
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that we're actually just
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
auditing department and not the
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes right there's no
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
educational component of this at all
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
alls are doing is whether or not the
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
Department's checked all the boxes the
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
way it's supposed to check all of the
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
boxes and my one concern would be that
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
we tell the audit comes out and says hey
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing their job and we have
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
parents screaming like no they're not
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it seems like a completely
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
contrasting discussion when we're saying
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to audit them and the audit
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
says they're doing their job and we have
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
parents but I will say that and I guess
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of timing on whether or
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
not you have the special education
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process audit that's
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
due out in in a few months on whether
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
this should be held until we know what
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
that looks like to see what the scope
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
should look like because that that
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
addresses the parents question right
 
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
there whereas this is just addressing
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
the business question
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
this scope addresses more than the
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
business question it is not a compliance
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
audit we do compliance auditing within
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
the context of a performance audit but
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking for results so we're going
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the effectiveness of
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
the Department's compliance or
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the requirements
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
that are imposed applying and if those
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
do not produce the results that we are
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
looking for from the program which is
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
articulated in state law we're looking
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that students have an
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get into subsequent
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
education to get into employment and to
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
achieve Independent Living if they're
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
not contributing to those results that
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's the focus of the audit does does
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
the system the department has in place
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
contribute to achieving those expected
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
outcomes that the legislature has
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
imposed upon it in RSA 186c it seems
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
like that word contribute to
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
is important Senator Whitley yeah and I
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
sort of feel like a broken record about
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
this but just to follow up on what you
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
just said the the department is required
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the leas are achieving
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
those outcomes and so that's what we're
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
looking for so I think it's Senator Lang
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're right that it's both you know are
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
they Meeting those requirements but then
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
um to know if they meet those
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
requirements they have to look at the
 
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
outcomes so that's that was sort of my
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
point is that correct it is and one of
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
the results that federal law and Rule
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
expects is improved results for students
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the things we're
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at is there a
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to examine whether
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
results improved over time or did not
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
improve over time if there's no system
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
in place for that then that's a systemic
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
law in the Department's control
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
construct and then we'll look at the
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
data to see whether there's actual
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
Improvement demonstrated or not and then
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there to see what might be
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
contributing to what we're seeing in the
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
data so if you were to expand this scope
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't take longer
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
it would definitely take longer I was
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
asked to calculate those numbers at a
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
minimum it would take four extra months
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
and another quarter million dollars
 
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
and another quarter million dollars
okay

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
what is the committee's pleasure
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative or
 
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
so just one other question there Senator
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
Whitley has made pretty clear that the
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know dictating on this one and I
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
totally get that
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
do you envision that in your audit
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
you might perceive weaknesses in what
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
the federal law allows the state to do
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.790 align:start position:0%
in terms of
uh

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
overseeing the local localities so we
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
might become aware of the fact that
 
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
there are areas there where the state is
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
incapable of
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
totally overseeing the uh localities if
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
we found something like that we would
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
certainly have something to say I will
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
note that the federal regulatory
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
construct gives the department a great
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
deal of discretion in how it implements
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
the program at the state level
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
so it is not it's not a checklist per se
 
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
that the state just picks up and runs
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the federal government places a
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
significant amount of requirements upon
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
the expenditures of funds and the like
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
but it does not specify how the
 
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
department is going to frame the program
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
how it's going to achieve improved
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
results for students how it's going to
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that the results at the state
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
because it's still fundamentally a state
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
program it is federally subsidized to
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
some extent but it is still
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a state program
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
so the federal government delegates
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of authority to the
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
department to construct a program to
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
effectively achieve those expected
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes so can I just comment I just I
 
01:22:58.130 --> 01:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
just want to end can I get to that yes
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
of course where does enforcement come in
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
that enforcement comes with the back end
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the department has an obligation to
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
identify aberrant performance in the
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
program and to address it through
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms if necessary
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
so those entities that are
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
persistently non-compliant are subject
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
to sanctions to include up to including
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
suspension of their Grant
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
so can I just clarify I mean because I
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
think it's an overstatement to say that
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
the department has significant amount of
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
latitude to enforce this I mean I am
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
regularly hemmed in by my own agency
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
saying you don't have authority to go
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
there like all I can do is work within a
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
procedural framework and I use as an
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
example this recent example of uh you
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
know a poorly executed IEP and a student
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
clearly everybody's intention was for a
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
child to be able to get this experience
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
this year and the district not doing
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that and I don't have the ability I have
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
no no legal authority to come in and say
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
like look give the people the thing what
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
we do is we work with schools you know
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
with our relationships to try and help
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
them to do the best thing for the child
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
but that would be an example of not
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
having the authority I would have been
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
happy to order put the kid in IP today
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
but I didn't have that Authority could
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
we give you that Authority I don't know
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
the answer to that and isn't that why
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about proceeding with
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
this performance audit right would you
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
be willing to entertain emotion
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
well are there more questions or is the
 
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.270 align:start position:0%
well are there more questions or is the
committee

01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
will to
 
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay I'm willing to entertain emotion
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
I would move that we accept the scope
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
statement as written taking into account
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
the explanations about all of the
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
aspects that members of the committee
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
have touched on that appear to me to be
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
part of what the audit is going to look
 
01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.610 align:start position:0%
part of what the audit is going to look
at

01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm good with that as long as the LBA is
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
good with that that they've been taking
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
copious notes and um they'll take that
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
into consideration when they're actually
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing the auditing work
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you'd like me to respond I certain we
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
will be so
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal descriptions yes we're going to
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
take a look at Trend data over time or
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
can we include such a table as to what
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
our IEP suitable conditions for students
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
we can certainly include that kind of
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
material in there and if there are other
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
specific concerns we can address those
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
as well and yes we'll go back through
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
our notes and make sure we've got
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
everything but fundamentally I just want
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
to state that what we've discussed here
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
today principally is what was in the
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
scope we intend to take a look at the
 
01:25:44.169 --> 01:25:44.179 align:start position:0%
results the department is facilitating
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
through the state system and see whether
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
it achieves those expected results or
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
not and given its limitations and we'll
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
take one closely look at what the
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
provisions of federal law and state law
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
provide as well as Federal rules State
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
rules and other authoritative guidance
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
and we will identify any gaps and if
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for this body to
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
suggest legislation or to for
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation here to be suggested we'll
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
certainly identify those as well Senator
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I think it
 
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
would be helpful Mr Grady if you would
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
share I think it would it would um you
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
know make the committee perhaps more
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the scope if you could
 
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
forward us those Federal requirements
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
regarding monitor enforcement because I
 
01:26:29.209 --> 01:26:29.219 align:start position:0%
think that's relevant to our
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
conversation if you're able to send them
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
on do that it might take a little bit of
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
touch because we're just scoping now
 
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.270 align:start position:0%
touch because we're just scoping now
right

01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
statements field work with and that is
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
something that we would work through
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
during field work but it is certainly
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
something that we could generate for
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
this body as soon as we recently can we
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
can certainly prioritize that part of
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
our plan work uh to occur sooner rather
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
than later and get you those citations

um

01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
okay what else do we need to talk about
 
01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:41.149 align:start position:0%
okay what else do we need to talk about
now

01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
the table then suspended items yep just
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
just very quickly on item number four
 
01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
there in terms of the um suspended or or
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
table topics just a
 
01:27:53.219 --> 01:27:54.590 align:start position:0%
table topics just a
little

01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
brief synopsis uh the Bureau of elderly
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and Adult Services
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
that was suspended November 21 by this
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
committee largely because
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
when we began the audit we became aware
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
of to to legal proceedings lawsuits that
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
were going to be Central to the
 
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.030 align:start position:0%
were going to be Central to the
autotopic

01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
autotopic
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
so so as not to interfere with that or
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
have that interfere with our audit we
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
the committee recommended that we we
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
suspend that for and whatever teams are
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
still on yeah yeah and probably will be
 
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
for a while is my guess
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh Public Access and bodies of water I
 
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
think as I recall discussion amongst the
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee there was going to be some
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
other legislative subcommittee that was
 
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
going to be looking into some of that so
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
it was decided not to move forward with
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
that at that point in time what's there
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.139 --> 01:28:46.689 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:46.699 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
your apartment did I get that right yeah
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
and Senator Pearl's not here so what I
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
think if I remember correctly with uh
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
those I I think you had someone had
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
asked you about public access to water
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
you brought it up as a topic that you
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
received and it was just sort of the
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
topic and at the meeting I believe
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
Senator guy to said oh I'm on a
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
committee that looks at that issue
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
and then but nothing happened like no we
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
didn't vote you didn't vote on whether
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
to kill the topic or to accept the topic
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
it was more it was just still there so
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
we kept it on the books for
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
for you to decide
 
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.610 align:start position:0%
for you to decide
anybody

01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
represented the Weber I think I raised
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
it at the request of a former
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative now that my memory is
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
being jogged and as I have heard nothing
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
further in this direction it may be one
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to leave for a little while
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
to see if anybody comes up with
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
something but
 
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
um if not
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable going either way with it
 
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.370 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable going either way with it
okay

01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
what about the Secretary of State's
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
archives and Records yeah that one is we
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
we do have a uh a limitation that we
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
cannot from performance out of
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
perspective go into a stat uh
 
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
perspective go into a stat uh
constitutional

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
officer like Secretary of State's office
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
in his duties so I think that that was
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
the reason that we table that or you
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
can't at this point in time
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
that office
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
correct yeah there's uh in our statute
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
it says that we're not allowed to audit
 
01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:29.219 align:start position:0%
the I think the Constitutional duties of
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
a constitutional officer and so you've
 
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
got I believe the Attorney General the
 
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.070 align:start position:0%
got I believe the Attorney General the
treasurer

01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.750 align:start position:0%
treasurer
and

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
well secretary of state right those are
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
three constitutional officers and we're
 
01:30:47.169 --> 01:30:47.179 align:start position:0%
unclear if we can audit anything they do
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
if everything in their agency is
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
considered a constitutional Duty which
 
01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
isn't which isn't um you know written
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
out in no one's defined what
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duties are at least we
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
haven't found it and we had Senate
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
research do some work for us and it's a
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
little vague so and why we can't look at
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
those offices as another one of these
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
questions of it goes way back to the
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of this this committee back in
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
like 87
 
01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:19.139 align:start position:0%
um it seems like it was a holdover from
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
there was a sunset review commission
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
that was in place before they they
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
created performance Audits and there
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
were certain
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that the sunset Review
 
01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:31.940 align:start position:0%
Committee couldn't look at including
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
Corrections and the Constitutional
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
officers so I think I think it was a
 
01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.669 align:start position:0%
officers so I think I think it was a
holdover

01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
holdover
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
from that but you know why we can't now
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure representative whoever
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
well if if we can't now because of
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
Statute and I think you probably
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
provided us with a statutory reference
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
but perhaps you could do that again
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that there's a
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh what we are prohibited to do by
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
Statute because we could simply change
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
the statute should we choose to audit
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
those uh branches of government if there
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional prohibition that
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
though uh that that is something we
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
can't stray into but it sounds from what
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's more of a
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
statutory prohibition than a
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional one and I
 
01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:28.820 align:start position:0%
I think from my perspective
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
unless there is a constitutional
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
separation of powers issue which doesn't
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
seem to me like there can be because
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
what we do is audit the executive branch
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
all the time and and we're the
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
legislature and we've always been told
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's office
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
sort of occupies a unique Niche between
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
those two
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that one of the
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
things we could consider is legislative
 
01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.450 align:start position:0%
things we could consider is legislative
action

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:01.460 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
on the statute
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
because it does seem to me that the
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional offices
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
have an enormous amount of effect on on
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
our government and our citizens and if
 
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:22.100 align:start position:0%
if nobody's kind of
 
01:33:26.169 --> 01:33:26.179 align:start position:0%
overseeing that it's perhaps an issue
 
01:33:26.179 --> 01:33:27.790 align:start position:0%
overseeing that it's perhaps an issue
also

01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
the number of different things those
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
agencies are doing at this point in time
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
is enormous so I I think that's
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
something for the committee to think
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
about for members to discuss among
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
themselves but I also want to say that
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really very pleased at the
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness and quality of the debate
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
that we've had here today because we've
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
spent a number of years coming in and
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
saying yeah we'll do that bang and
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
leaving and I think these are things we
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
really ought to think a little bit
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
harder about so thank you for bringing
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
it was chaired by Senator Reagan we
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
budge oh got it
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay budget
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
archives and records and I mean line
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
items in the budget we know it's not
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
like the judicial branch where we just
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
give them money and say here goes Bandit
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
so yeah if I may it's RSA 14 colon 31a
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
letter D where it states uh this is the
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
LBA audit division statute
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
um letter D is conduct such program
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
result audits of any Department board
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
institution Etc however further in the
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the uh the section says
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
this paragraph shall not apply to
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers in the execution
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
of their constitutional duties
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
so that's the limitation that we're
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
there may be one the only reason I can
 
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
think of is we don't audit the
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislature because that would be a
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
conflict you're our boss and so we we
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
audit everyone else I believe the
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
legislature has a role in picking those
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
positions and whether that's in some way
 
01:35:20.159 --> 01:35:21.649 align:start position:0%
positions and whether that's in some way
considered

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know you're picking that person in a
 
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
legislative role and then should we go
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
in there and audit them that may be
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
maybe the reason but that's just a guess
 
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
on my part so if we wanted if we were
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
hearing for example that
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
on all the papers in the archives have
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
water dripping on them and they were
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
getting mildewed we couldn't
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
audit how
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
handling the records of the state I
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
think it's it's questionable someone I
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
mean we'd have to seek legal advice on
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
whether you could send us in now
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
could you hire an outside consultant to
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
come in and do that
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
probably which is kind you know which is
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
kind of strange
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
but whether you could send us in to look
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
at that is is questionable
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair yes
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I I will volunteer uh for the
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know work with Senate research to
 
01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
see if we can get more legislative
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
history on the provision that they just
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned that would be great that would
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
put the lawyers on it the last topic
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
there is oblc oplc just a little history
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
on that um there was a lot of discussion
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
amongst previous committees
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
um obviously there's been a lot of
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
restructuring going on with oplc a lot
 
01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:50.649 align:start position:0%
restructuring going on with oplc a lot
of

01:36:50.649 --> 01:36:50.659 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
transition and turnover and positions
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature but the but
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the LBA also made them aware that there
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
has been several recent audits that have
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
touched on elements of oplc in
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
particular the the most recent Board of
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
dental examiners there was a very large
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
section there that dealt with oplc's
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
control structure environment and there
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
will be some elements as well coming out
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
in the mental health Workforce
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
requirements audit because you're
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with several boards there too so
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
so given given the work that we were
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
doing the committee decided just a table
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
of full-blown audit of oplc itself so
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's a little history with that one so
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
okay so does anybody wish to take any of
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
these days hold on it's
 
01:37:42.010 --> 01:37:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly
 
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber with reset
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
respect the office of professional
 
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.689 align:start position:0%
respect the office of professional
licensure

01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that's absolutely true that there
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
have been little bits of it looked at
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
um having sat on this committee
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
continuously the longest it seems to me
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
that every year we say we ought to do
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
something about that and they're still
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
restructuring and they have been
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
restructured uh continuously for as long
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
as I have served in this body uh so at
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
some point we might want to think about
 
01:38:18.719 --> 01:38:19.669 align:start position:0%
some point we might want to think about
um

01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:23.169 --> 01:38:23.179 align:start position:0%
a look at the current structure and
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing because
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
many of the things that are recommended
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
during an audit are actually very
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
helpful to an agency in their operations
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
and it's a fresh pair of eyes a
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
different perspective and uh sometimes
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
quite useful either either for the
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
agency or for us or for both
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
depending on everybody's mindset going
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
in and coming out
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
um so I I definitely don't want to take
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
this one off the list but I'd certainly
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
agree that this isn't the time to
 
01:39:01.850 --> 01:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
launch into something else and we may
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
decide to do it in within the scope of
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
those bytes of particular professions
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah I agree I shouldn't
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
come off I mean I know the house passed
 
01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:21.260 align:start position:0%
a 78 page about the restructuring of
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
oplc and I know I put a couple bills in
 
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:25.820 align:start position:0%
about oplc
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
we change the funding sources and a
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
bunch of things so I agree while it
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
might need something we first have to
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
get into a stable place before we can
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
any other business us that any members
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
want to bring forward
 
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.729 align:start position:0%
want to bring forward
okay

01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.739 --> 01:39:48.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
well I don't see this is a public
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
meeting it is not a public hearing so it
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
would be up to
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
the folks here for two minutes
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
two minutes Mr Huss
 
01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay one and a half minutes because I
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
two comments I want to make on the
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
commission of human rights to the office
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
from Gilman
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh just uh one and a half minutes here
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh on the commission of Human
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
Rights and also the office of
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
my comment is that I did attend the uh
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
house bill I don't know the number on
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
human rights at the house Judiciary
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
Committee and Ani ahni the black woman
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
in charge of the human rights came in
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
and she gave an excellent presentation
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
saying that there's 230 cases there
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
sitting and they have four five
 
01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:02.219 align:start position:0%
investigators four that actually have a
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
case load of 25 each
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
the other one handles the back load
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
and she asked for three more
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
investigators and she got two according
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
to the budget
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
not last I heard
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
also too the number of hearings they
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
have per year is less than one there's
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
four hearings in five years time
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
and so I make a comparison to the office
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
of professional that there's a
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
subdivision of that that's the real
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
estate commission so I would like if you
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
could to reopen to have another vote
 
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
maybe to have an investigation of that
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
because I've asked Lindsay Courtney is
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
the chair is the commissioner
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
she sent me an email the other day
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
because I got the Royal run around from
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
the underlings and the underlings all
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
they say is contact the right to know if
 
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
you have a problem so I contacted Thomas
 
01:41:54.649 --> 01:41:54.659 align:start position:0%
Kerr kehr at the State House Annex
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm going next
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get a comparison like what
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
I just told you on the human rights how
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
many cases do they have of complaints
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
that the Real Estate Commission I can't
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
get an answer of that
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
I mean right to know I can go and like
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
get a whole year Supply and do my own
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
statistics but I'm trying to find out
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
