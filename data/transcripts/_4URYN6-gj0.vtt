on today's
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
agenda um I'm going to open the public
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna represented Harrington to
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um representative
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington I represent straford
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
district 18 and I'm presenting Bill HB
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
135 which is pretty simple bill it
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
basically codifies part of our state
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 1 Section 12 uh
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
which is pretty clear about what it
 
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.829 align:start position:0%
which is pretty clear about what it
says

00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
um it says but no part of a man's
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
property shall be taken from him or
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
applied to public use without his
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
consent or that of his representative
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
body of people nor are the inhabitants
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
of this state controllable by any other
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
laws than those which we which they or
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
the representative body have given their
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
consent and this has to do with the
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
Wayfair decision having to do with sales
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
tax and in the way of a little history
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um some time ago there was a movement by
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
sales tax states to they want to impose
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
the sales tax on non-sales tax states so
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
if someone from New Hampshire
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
sells a product to say Massachusetts or
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
New York or or South Dakota then that uh
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
company in New Hampshire would be
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting and providing
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
that sales tax revenue to the state and
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
to put that in a little bit of
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
perspective the best estimate I've heard
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
so far is there's over 13,000 different
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
sales tax rates in this in the country
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
and that's because each state may have a
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
different one they have some have city
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
tax some don't
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh it varies on items I mean here's a
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
quirk to show that examples of how
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
strange some of these laws are if under
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
the Wayfare decision you would to sell a
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
um a charcoal grill to someone in
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you would collect tax on
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
the grill but if you sold them a bag of
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
charcoal to go along with it you
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't collect tax on the charcoal
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
because charcoal is called a fuel and
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
therefore it's exempt from sales tax um
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
another example from my friends in
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they just announced
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to put sales tax on candy
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
now PR previously food was exempt from
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
the sales tax I imagine there'll be two
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
or three pages of definition of what
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
constitutes candy I mean is Baker's
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
chocolate that's going to used to make a
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
pie is that candy or is it only
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
chocolate that's going to go into
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hershey's bars so it's extremely
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
complicated I see of no way anyone can
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
keep up on this because they're subject
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
to change constantly you'd have to hire
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
an outside service in order to keep up
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
with these 13,000 plus different sales
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
tax rates so what happened is a while
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
ago a bunch of States decided there was
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
a decision called The Quill decision
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
which was made by the Supreme Court and
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
it said no if you don't have a physical
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
presence in that state the state cannot
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
collect sales tax from it and that was
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
how everything worked for quite some
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
time a bunch of States decided we didn't
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
want this we want to get sales tax from
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
everybody mostly because of the
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
increased business through the internet
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
and 20 States actually passed laws that
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
said we will collect taxes from other
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
states basically saying we're going to
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
to defy the quill decision and that
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
eventually made it up to the Supreme
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
Court and the Supreme Court being pushed
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
by former Justice Kennedy ruled 5 to
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
four to overturn that and came up with
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
the Wayfair decision now the Wayfair
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
decision is of course not quite as
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
simple as just saying well you have to
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
keep track of all 13,000 various sales
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
taxes because many of these states have
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
caveats in the law excuse me could you
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
hold on a second um would you mind going
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
out and talk roing out in the hall
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay many of these states have caveats
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the law the most common one is that
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you do not have over 200 shipments to
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
a particular state or you do not exceed
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 you do not have to collect the
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
sales tax of course the problem comes
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
there is maybe you think well last year
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
I had 150 uh shipments to South Dakota
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to worry about
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
collecting the sales tax so I don't
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
November comes around and I go uhoh I
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
just hit 198 I can't go back and collect
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
all that sales tax from the orders that
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
I've already sent so the only thing I
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
can do is now stop selling my product to
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
any state with that uh limits coming
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
about so as you can see it's extremely
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to comply with this and I
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a real burden on our on our
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh business but it our solution what I'm
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
proposing is that we do just what the
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
other states did when they try to
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
overcome the the quill decision we do
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
that by overcoming the Mayflower
 
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
decision the Wayfair decision the same
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
way by simply codifying our Constitution
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill says and it says
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
that the basically it comes down to
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
therefore no New Hampshire business
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
retailers shall be required to collect
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
sales or use taxes for a foreign
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
government will provide any information
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the facilitation of collecting these
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
taxes unless such collect collection is
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
mandated by the Congress of the United
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
States in accordance with the commer
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
Clause Article 1 Section 3 CL laws three
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
of the United States Constitution where
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
the Constitution says specifically
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
Congress has the authority to regulate
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce not the Supreme
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
Court or by New Hampshire law and I
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
think this is would be right for an
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
overturn on the Supreme Court as Justice
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
Robert said in his descent uh basically
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
it should be left up to Congress and
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
Congress has the opportunity to do this
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
they have this specific constitutional
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
authority to do it and they've chosen
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
not to do it so what this would be is
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're just saying let's do the same
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
thing that the states did to get quill
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
overturned we want to do to get wafer
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
overturned a copy of this has been given
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general personally uh
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
back in December I haven't heard any
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
response from their office so I don't
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
know what their position is on it but I
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
think it's incumbent on the state of New
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to defend our Constitution and
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
by codifying that portion of the
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution it makes it very clear that
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
if you're in New Hampshire you're not
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
being governed by other states and it's
 
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
just again so we're clear it's not a
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
simple fact of just collecting the tax
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
and sending it to somebody else
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
obviously that costs that's going to be
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
time and cumbersome but you're going to
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
have to subscribe to some type of
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
service to keep track of these 13,000
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
plus various rates and you're also going
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
to have to keep track of every product
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
that you sell to every state so it
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't exceed that State's uh
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
particular uh caps and again that's not
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
Universal the most common one is 200
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
Sales or over $100,000 but there are
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
many states they have no caps at all or
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between so again it's
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
another complicated burden on our
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
companies that want to sell stuff and
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
clearly both the United States
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution which says interstate
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
commerce is in the hands of Congress and
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution which
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
says you have to do it by our elected
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
officials clearly back this bill and I
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
would hope you'd prove it and I'm
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
willing to take any
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative om
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative heritton
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
for your description of the Wayfair
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
decision I'm confused by the bill
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
however the bill as written talks about
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
collecting taxes for foreign government
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
makes no reference to the US states can
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
you clarify for
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
us the I was told by um office of
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
legislative service that foreign
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
government means any government other
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire cor
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Spar um with uh
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh if I understand you the purpose of
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is really to take some of the
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
owner's burden of of the regulation of
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
having to get collect these taxes for
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
these businesses and companies who work
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
here in the state is that correct well
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's twofold uh obviously to do that as
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
well but it's also to enforce our
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
constitution I I find it difficult to
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
believe that the Supreme Court's going
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
to rule that the longstanding state of
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Constitution is
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional okay follow up um the
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
other states that don't have sales taxes
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
I think like Delaware Oregon uh Texas
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
not Texas Alaska and there might be one
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
other I think but did have they done
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
anything like this uh not that I'm aware
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
of no but like I said in the past there
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
was a movement and we got about 20
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
states to pass laws to overturn I guess
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
that was some type of an organized
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
effort and South Dakota was the first
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
one that made it through the courts
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
hence South Dakota versus Wayfair is the
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision um but I mean
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with New Hampshire being
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
first and if other states want to on
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm I want to
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
try to make sure I understand the
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
arguments that you're making
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
here um I believe what you're saying and
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
correct me if I get this wrong I believe
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying is that since
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
the uh collection of taxes from non New
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from foreign jurisdictions was
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
a decision that came from the Supreme
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
Court and wasn't enacted there's no law
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
that the United States Congress passed
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
or the New Hampshire uh legislature
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
passed that says that those taxes need
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
collected then despite the fact that the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court made a ruling to that
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
effect we don't have to worry about
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
it that's basically what it is I'm
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
saying that I disagree with the Supreme
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
Court decision uh I think if you if you
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
look at the the uh Interstate commer
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
Clause it specifically says Congress has
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to uh regulate interstate
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
commerce uh it doesn't say the Supreme
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
Court it mentions there's no mention of
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court whatsoever they've
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
sort of invented this secondary Commerce
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
Clause that they apply to themselves
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
somehow and again I think uh this was
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
being pushed by Justice Kennedy big time
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
he basically told the states bring it to
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and we'll rule in your
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
favor but it was only five to four I
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
just think it's right to be overturned
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
and our constitution is very clear on it
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's very specific if it's not a person
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
or a person that they get to vote for
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
then nobody else can impose not only
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
just taxes but tell them what to do
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
basically follow up thank you all right
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not a constitutional
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
lawyer I think I remember from 10th
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
grade civics
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
has Supreme Court decisions are the law
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
of the land not of a particular state so
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand is if the
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court were to hand down any
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
other kind of decision that we didn't
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
like for whatever reason could we say
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
well we don't like it so you know we
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to honor it
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
no not at all because I mean you have to
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
look very specifically at the words in
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
our constitution nor are the inhabitants
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
of this state controllable by any other
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
laws than those to which they or the
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative body have given their
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
consent that's very specific so just a
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling of something that
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
we don't care for doesn't mean it's in
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
violation of our constitution what this
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
what the states did other states did is
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
they said we think quill should be
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
overturned the previous Supreme Court
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
ision that said you must have a physical
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
presence in the state in order to force
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
someone to collect uh the sales tax so
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
those States pushed the issue into the
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
court and the court changed that five to
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
four in Wayfair what I'm suggesting here
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
is powered by our Constitution which
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
specifically says this issue is not
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
allowed in New Hampshire if we're going
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
to enforce our Constitution that we
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
should take that and push it back to the
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and hope they overturn
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
Wayfair and say that it it was a mistake
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
just like they did with ro V
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
well I thank you for your comment but
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'll also point out that regardless of
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
whether a decision is 9 nothing or 54 a
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
decision is still a DEC decision thank
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
you well I agree with that but I'm just
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
saying 54 shows that it was not locked
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
in stone by the Supreme Court that's all
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
represent thank you represent Harington
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm right
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
here not across the a like we were were
 
00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.669 align:start position:0%
here not across the a like we were were
last

00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
year the uh question I have is since New
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ratified the Constitution of
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
the United
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
States does not the Constitution of the
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.230 align:start position:0%
States does not the Constitution of the
United

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
United
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
States have Supremacy over the New
 
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.070 align:start position:0%
States have Supremacy over the New
Hampshire

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution yes I believe it does but
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
you can also show me the part in the U
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the United States Constitution where
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
it says the Supreme Court Shall Set
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
limits on how you collect sales tax from
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
other states and if you sell more than
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
500 units to this state or 200 units
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
that or it's over 100,000 that this is
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
clearly legislation by the court and
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's not decare it's not saying a law
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional or constitutional
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's saying we're going to we're going
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
to substitute our judgment for the
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and we're going to
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
circumvent Congress follow
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you Mr chair uh
representative

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
um in order
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
to contest Court since we have the
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause in the United States
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution what would be the elements
 
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.909 align:start position:0%
Constitution what would be the elements
to

00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.590 align:start position:0%
to
trigger

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
contestation of a decision that is
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
allowed under the
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution that I'm going to have to
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
defer to so I'm an engineer not lawyer
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
but I am assuming whatever mechanism for
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
example South Dakota used to get their
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
law because they passed a law that said
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that disagreed with the Quintel decision
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
we're I'm suggesting the same approach
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
we pass a law that disagrees with the
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
Wayfair decision and that gets pursued
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
in the courts I would assume the state
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
would would file to represent uh our
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
companies in I guess federal district
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
court and it would move its way up
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
through that but I I the exact details I
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't know but I know it can be done
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
because it was done by South Dakota and
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
other states in the quill decision
 
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.789 align:start position:0%
other states in the quill decision
follow

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
up would not
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
individuals since the state has no
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
standing would not individuals in the
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
state have to be
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
harmed and would this bill give standing
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
to those
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
individuals to contest the uh Supreme
 
00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:25.830 align:start position:0%
individuals to contest the uh Supreme
Court

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
ruling well as again as far as the
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
technical legal issues I'm I'm not a
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer but harming they're they're
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
already harmed anybody who's complying
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
with the way decision is being harmed
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
right now because they're spending a lot
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of time and effort keeping track of who
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
they're selling to what and what the tax
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
rate is I'm sure they be paying someone
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
to tell them if you sell something to uh
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's a clock to someone in Los Angeles
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
California you have to charge
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
11.2% uh sales tax on it but if you sell
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
clocks to someone in Tennessee don't
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
worry they're EX EXT so there's already
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
harm being done and I would think just
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
like in the case of the of the quill
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
decision of the overturning the quill
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
decision it was called South Dakota
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
versus the versus Wayfair and that's who
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's who took it on and I would see
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
why I don't see why not New Hampshire
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
approach representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and good to see you Mike uh so
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
this sounds like another New Hampshire
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
first you know we're we're taking this
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
because we believe we have our state's
 
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.389 align:start position:0%
because we believe we have our state's
rights

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
versus the rights of all the other
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
states we're looking after our state
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
first it also sounds like an unfunded
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
mandate to require businesses and
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
whoever to collect these taxes my
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
question is has any state ever refused
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
to follow a scotus
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
ruling that I don't know I think there
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
has been some litigation on this and I'm
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
not sure if states are doing it or
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
individuals doing it I did get a call
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
from a couple of businesses and most of
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
them were small and they said we're
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
taking the position we don't do enough
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
business with any particular state to to
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
kick in their their um the the setting
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
where we have to start collecting it but
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are people in New
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that sell on larger scales so
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
when you're talking $100,000 that's not
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of money these days and some
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
states uh the limit is even lower so I
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know specific speically
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
how the uh how the individuals uh states
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
are how the individual companies are
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with it but I don't know maybe
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be somebody here from the Bia
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
or something that can speak on that so
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so I was thinking in
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
terms of the Bruin decision when the
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
Bruin decision came down against New
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
York state New York State Massachusetts
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of the blue State skirted the law
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court decision by
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
enacting their own laws their own
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
specific areas of safety or you know saf
 
00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.669 align:start position:0%
specific areas of safety or you know saf
zones

00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
zones
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
whatever uh I know for fact that uh you
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
know children are taken across borders
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
for abortion you know we pass laws in
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
different states limiting the rights of
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
young people yet you know we say that
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're not smart enough they're not old
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
enough they're not mature enough to make
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
decisions on whether it's gambling or
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's smoking or drinking yet we can
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
change their gender we can let them
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
change their gender I mean do you think
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
this is something for the
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
courts well I think that what we've got
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
here is in what I'm trying to put is
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
that our constitution is very explicit
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
on this I mean it's not just not just
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
collecting taxes but it says it's
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
controllable by other law by laws other
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
than those for which they are the
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative body passed so if
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts decides to pass a law that
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
says everyone's got to wear green hats
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday that can't be enforced in New
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and what I'm saying is
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
this Supreme Court decision which is a
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
result of laws passed in other states
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
cannot be enforced in New Hampshire
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
either thank
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question um there
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
was a comment made by my colleague uh
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
that this is an unfunded mandate I want
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
to understand is there any state action
 
00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.549 align:start position:0%
to understand is there any state action
involved

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of collecting these taxes no
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
there's no action by the state of New
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire involved in collecting the
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
taxes it would be between the individual
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
company and the state that they you know
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
the states Massachusetts they would send
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
the the when they collect their the the
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
involvement would be okay so they want
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
to get a pro purchase from Massachusetts
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
and it's something that's uh has the tax
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
on it so they would say it's $100 but I
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what the sales tax I think
 
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's 6% so they would collect $100 plus
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
6% tax that 6% tax then they would remit
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire I mean to
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts new state of
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would not be involved
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
right I I understand that but there is
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
no Government
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
funding that's involved in any way in
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
other states asking our citizens to pay
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
taxes in their states we're not involved
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
in trying to collect those taxes the
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is not involved
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
so there's no way that in terms of the
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
government that this is an unfunded
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
mandate right there's no yeah there is
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
no unfunded mandate thank
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
you representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
chairman so this may not be an unfunded
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
mandate but do you know are there costs
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
involved in recordkeeping and then
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
sending taxes across the country to
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
different states so on so forth I mean
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
it may not be specifically an unfunded
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
mandate but it sure sounds like there's
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of recordkeeping cost would you
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree I I think the
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
confusion here is we're talking about
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's unfunded mandate for the
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
state or individuals clearly this is a
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
mandate for individuals to spend money
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
as I said there over 13,000 sales tax
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
different rates and no one's going to
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
keep track of that no one's going to be
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
able to pull off the top of the head oh
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're coming from Dallas Texas you're
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
know buying a widget so I know exactly
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's a 3.8% sales tax on it uh nope
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
wait wait a minute there's a special tax
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
because it's in Dallas they add 1% on so
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's 4.8 obviously you're going to have
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
to hire some outside firm to keep track
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
of these thousands and thousands of tax
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
rates and this it's not only that but
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
some things that are taxable in one
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
state aren't taxable in another uh again
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
using Massachusetts I think the cut off
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
is if you buy a a jacket for $200 you
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
pay no sales tax on it if you buy a
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
jacket for $300 you pay sales tax on the
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
amount over $200 so there's all these
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
nuances in the law it would be
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
impossible to keep track of it plus
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to keep track of
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
the total amount because if you get to
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
that point where you say all right well
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
I know in South Dakota uh this is going
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
to be $98,000 and it's September I got
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
to stop selling stuff to South Dakota
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
because I can't go back and collect the
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
taxes that I didn't collect so the only
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
option I have now is not doing any
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
business with South Dakota until next
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair are you aware of any
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
database that does keep all that uh that
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
tax information and the ch es in each
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
state and locality I I'm not aware
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
specifically but I find it hard to
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
believe that there isn't one because you
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
know if you have a state with a sales
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
tax I'm sure they're they're doing it
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
already and I how I I can't conceive of
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
how anyone could comply with it without
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
having something like that but I don't
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
know of one specifically just a quick
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
followup follow up um you know meals and
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
room tax uh the state here allows uh my
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
understanding from businesses to keep 3%
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the six or seven whatever it is has
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
there been any thought as far as maybe
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh as I was thinking out of the box
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
saying you know for these businesses
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
this could be a not maybe not a profit
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Center but at least a
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
neutral I'm I'm not aware of any and my
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
understanding and again I'm not a lawyer
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
but my understanding of how the Wayfair
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
decision was is it allows every
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
individual state to set that so I mean
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
you could end up a situation where you
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
know uh Oklahoma says you can keep uh 2%
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
of this to cover your expenses and New
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
York says we want it all I I just I I
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
don't know but it could go that way
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
because the the Supreme Court basically
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
allowed the states to set their own for
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
example the amount of limit on it and
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
you oh yes we'll take one more question
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative I I had a
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
question uh just as an example so if
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
there was a requirement let let's say
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had a sales tax and a
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire was um selling
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
products with the intention of the
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
destination being
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts would uh and they they had
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
records of that what would prevent the
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts Department of Revenue
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
from uh conducting an audit of that
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire well under
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
the quill decision it was a physical
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
presence in the state and if I think if
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
you remember and I don't remember all
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
the exact details but there was a
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
situation on that with people buying
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
tires in Southern New Hampshire under
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch and he basically told
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
them you're not coming up here checking
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
out people out and you're not collecting
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
sales tax for sale for tires sold in uh
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that was back I don't
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
know five or six years ago anyways maybe
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
more more than that
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
up I I recall that but in that case the
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
fact they didn't collect those taxes
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
were they essentially in abled like if
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts sent them assessment for
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
loss Revenue did they have to were they
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
required to pay that money to
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I don't remember the
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
details but other than I think the way
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
it turned out is that they did the
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
governor made it pretty clear that
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
you're not collecting sales tax from
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
transactions in New Hampshire and uh go
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
away and that's why I think it
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
ended okay thank you very much for your
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for listening to me
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
for such a long time we'll now hear from
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
simp I guess I should start by saying we
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't take a formal position on on any
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill so we're not I'm not here to oppose
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
or or support this bill I'm not here to
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
weigh in on whether it's wise as a
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
matter of policy I think you've seen our
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
office um can be quite vigorous in terms
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
of Defending uh you know the tax
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
structure that we have in our state at
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
this point but but I'm not here for any
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
purpose other than to provide some
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
technical insight and to answer any
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions that that the committee may
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
have um I'm certainly sympathetic and
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen it at our office to a number
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the issues that representative
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
Harrington brought to to this
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
committee's attention Wayfair did upend
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
um the the pretty cleancut uh physical
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
presence rule to one that has what's
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
called an economic Nexus and that there
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
are tens of thousands of taxing
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and it created um serious
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
compliance burdens for for businesses to
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to comply with other states
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately um at least to some extent
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
states have started to become more
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
lockstep in how they are setting up
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
their tax structures so every state in
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
the country now does have a 1 $100,000
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
um threshold for an economic Nexus um
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
there aren't State not every state has
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
adopted the 200 um transaction threshold
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of local taxing
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um one example we hear all
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
the time is Alaska where you basically
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
every municipality within Alaska um can
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
have its own uh individual uh local tax
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
rate um but Alaska's also passed
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to try to create that to
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
make that more uniform to have their
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities um kind of buy into a
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
uniform tax structure it hasn't resolved
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
the question um or or the problem and I
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
I want to make that clear that we do
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
still uh in our um implementation
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
efforts and enforcement efforts for
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
chapter 78e which was Senate Bill 242 it
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
was passed in the wake of the W Wayfair
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
decision interact with New Hampshire
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that that Express frustration
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
with the compliance costs and the
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
complication of of complying with other
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
states um uh taxing regimes but I do
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
think um from where we were in 2018 or
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
2019 when I was first year to where we
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
are now um it is a little bit the the
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
the the things are a little bit more
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
uniform and and that's certainly an
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
encouraging development um in terms of
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
this specific bill um uh the concerns we
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
have at the Department of Justice are
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
legal concerns and they're legal
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that that kind of um run into a
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
a practical concern um the legal
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
concerns are really that and I think
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
that a number of the members of the
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee and representative Harrington
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
recognized this we're we're really in um
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
Uncharted constitutional territory when
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the interplay both
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal government
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
for for Taxation and the states Vis the
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
other states for taxation that's what we
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
in constitutional lawyers call vertical
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
federalism and horizontal federalism um
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
and so in terms of vertical federalism
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
um the Supreme Court has never
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
specifically said that a state can
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforce its tax laws against the
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
resident of another resident of another
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
state without an act of Congress but it
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
certainly strongly implied it that was
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
an issue that could have come up in
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
Wayfair it didn't come up in way fair
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court um adopted the
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
economic Nexus test there without saying
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
well Congress would need to pass a law
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and there are certainly other cases
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
older cases from the US Supreme Court
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
that contemplate for income tax purposes
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
and other things that one state can tax
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
the resident of another state in the
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
absence of an act of Congress and so
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
there is a I think a serious risk with
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
this law that it would be challenged on
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional grounds and as um
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative ol was pointing out could
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
be subject to a supremacy clause
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
argument that basically the Federal
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution supplants anything that is
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
in our state constitution in this Arena
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um and so therefore the the the the
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
effect of our state con constitutional
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
provision is is doesn't work in the way
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill would be designed to have
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
it work um the other complicating Factor
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh from my perspective is the interplay
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
with our laws and the laws of other
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
states because what we would be doing is
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
we'd be saying our constitution
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
authorizes the state of New Hampshire to
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
pass a state statute that exempt state
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents from complying
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
with other states laws other states I'm
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
guessing would take the position that
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
their laws um which uh flow from their
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
constitution allow them to to tax
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
residents of other states who are doing
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
business in their states and that
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
creates a a constitutional conflict
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
between one state and another state I
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
have no idea how that constitutional
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
conflict would shake out um we've done
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
some research into it it hasn't really
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
come up in a way that that gives me any
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
confidence that if our law was
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
challenged on those grounds basically
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
under either the full faith or credit
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
and Credit Clause of the US Constitution
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
or What's called the dormant Commerce
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
Clause the um negative Commerce Clause
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Constitution whether we
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to persuade a court and
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately the US Supreme Court that our
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
law should Trump the law of another
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
state I mean they would both be
 
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.309 align:start position:0%
state I mean they would both be
affecting

00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
our law would be affecting businesses in
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
another state that we're trying to
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
collect from our residents their law
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
would be affecting residents of our
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
state who are doing business in the
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
state and there's no clear answer to
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
that question um and so those are
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
serious constitutional questions and as
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
someone who does a fair amount of
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional law they're extremely
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
interesting academically I think you
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
know our job at our office is to defend
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
the laws that that the general court
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
passes and the governor signs and I
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
think there would be good faith
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
arguments at first blush to defend this
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
law but but it's certainly not a
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
foregone conclusion that we would
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
Prevail in that sort of defense and and
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to flag that um it would be
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
a complicated kind of Uncharted question
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
the Practical concern that that flows
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
from that and I raised that this to the
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee in written testimony last year
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
when a similar bill was before the
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee I wasn't able to come I think
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
I was out with a sick kid but did put it
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
into writing is what that where that
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
leaves New Hampshire taxpayers in the
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
interim because New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
would have a law that appears to assure
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
them that they don't have to comply with
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
other states taxing regimes um but there
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
would be a serious question whether they
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
in fact had to do so as a matter of of
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional law and that
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
creates um I think a practical risk for
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
businesses uh whether they're going to
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
have to be subject to other states laws
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding our law um and creates a
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
lot of uncertainty for businesses which
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
I know folks in the business Community
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
tell me anytime I interact with them
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
uncertainty is is not helpful for for
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
kind of promoting business within the
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
state um and and at a minimum I think
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
that creates confusion and uncertainty
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
um what it also will do and we've seen
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
this in terms of uh businesses that have
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
contacted us after Wayfair and um in
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
conjunction with uh chapter 78e is it's
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to drive up potentially compliance
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
cost for businesses they're going to we
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice are unable
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not unique to this regime to
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
provide uh either tax advice or legal
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
advice to to private parties and we
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to take a definitive
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
position on this anyway and so
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
businesses would be you know we would
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
recommend they hire accountants they
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
hire attorneys and there are obviously
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
significant costs associated with that
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
and so th those are really the Practical
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that flow out of the UN
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
uncertain constitutional ground here
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know that that I want to
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
express to the committee um it it's not
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
to one way or the other on whether this
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
law is a good idea as a matter of policy
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
but I do think there are serious
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions it would
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
generate and um and potential uh
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
Downstream effects for businesses um at
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
least at least until those questions
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
were resolved I welcome any questions
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you represent
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
elme thank you
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
um you know that this has been going on
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
for quite a long time and that the large
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
majority of states are on the side of
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
this issue and there is only one on this
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
side of this issue um but um we did put
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
in a law which uh I think you're in
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
charge of complaints to the department
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
about on what they consider to be
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
violations of their sovereignty most of
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
the businesses some the number the
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
biggest businesses had already before we
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
did that started
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
paying uh uh because it was cheaper than
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
going through a legal system and the
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
legal system the national one
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
on but on
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
how I forget how many years ago it was
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
you were last year four or I I believe
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
so it was I believe that was that it was
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
s242 passed I think in 2019 um it was
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
passed after I joined the office and
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's now RSA chapter 78e right and uh at
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
the time you had gotten very few uh
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
complaints from businesses that they
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have to obey this and
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
um you'd resolved them together I
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
believe but uh have there been a lot
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
more complaints since there haven't
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Al me um so so the the
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
statute you're referring to is RSA
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
chapter 78e it does a number of
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
different things one of the things that
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
it did is it provided an Avenue for
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
businesses um that were re receiving
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
Outreach or collection efforts from
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
foreign taxing jurisdictions to contact
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
our office um to bring that to our
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
office's attention to share that
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
information confidentially not subject
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
to 91a um so I can't go into the
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
specifics of Outreach that we've
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
received what I can say is it's still a
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
relatively small number um a lot of the
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
initial Outreach and some of the more
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
recent Outreach continues to be we don't
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
know how to comply um and whether we
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
need to what what do we do and those are
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
obviously hard conversations because
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
it's usually we need to advise you to to
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
talk to your own uh tax Authority or
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
your own attorney um we have received a
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
small number and what I can do if it
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be helpful is Supply this
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee with our annual report we
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue an annual report every uh November
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and I believe it probably went to the
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
the prior chair it was in November 1st
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and so what I can do is I can
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
certainly send that along after this
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
hearing today um but that what that
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
report details is there have been a very
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
small number of out of Outreach from
 
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
businesses um reflecting what appear to
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
be Bonafide uh collection efforts um and
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we continue to look into them I
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
probably can't say any more specifically
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
than that we have not found an instance
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
so far of either fraudulent efforts to
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
collect taxes or or efforts to collect
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
taxes that are clearly uh don't comply
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
with with federal law or or with state
 
00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
with with federal law or or with state
law

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
um what I will say too is I think you're
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
right and at least anecdotally that most
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that had the volume of
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
transactions that would have subjected
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
themselves to uh forign foreign taxing
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
effort collection efforts um have come
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
into compliance that or have made
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
efforts to do so they've hired
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
accounting firms or law firms um not
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
ideal I know for those businesses But
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately kind of in the uncertain
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
ground that we're in um I think has
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
driven down the number of um number and
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
then the only other thing I'd add and I
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't really have a great explanation
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
for this I only really have a few
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
hypotheses is that it doesn't appear
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we've had that many states making
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
concerted efforts to collect taxes from
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
our businesses and it may well be that
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many New Hampshire
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that are doing um enough
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
business in different states that
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're really Hing those
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 thresholds um it may well be
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
that uh passing chapter 78e kind of let
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
States know we're taking a close look at
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
this and and New Hampshire didn't become
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
a target for that reason um it it may
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
well be and this may be tooting our own
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
horn a little bit too much but when we
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
brought the the original action in the
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court against Massachusetts
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic with respect to
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
income tax that got a lot of press it
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
got a lot of press in in both kind of
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
nationally and in and legal
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
um journals and it may well be that that
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
states are aware that if if they run a
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
foul of what we think the constitutional
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
laws we're prepared um to to ask a court
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
to look at it but I I don't know that's
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
all speculative all I can say is that
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
the number uh is still relatively low
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
and we look into the ones that appear to
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
be bonified collection
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
ill U thank you Mr G appreciate your um
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
commentary thus far uh you brought up
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
the income tax and that uh was my
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
question um Massachusetts is able to
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
apply income tax to New Hampshire
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
residents who are working in because if
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
I'm understand it correctly IRS rules or
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps law say that income tax is
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
collected where the work is
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
done and that was the argument that the
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire made regarding the work
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
being done in New Hampshire not in
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
Boston is that correct correct with a
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
with a little wrinkle but but I don't
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
have to add it if you don't need it
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
follow up on that follow up so that
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
would be the core there was an existing
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
law currently you're saying that there
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
is no existing
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
law should therefore the effort be not
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire law but on New
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Congress
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
Critters um I I don't want to weigh in
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
on what I think would be kind of a wise
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
effort from a policy standpoint what I
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
will say is that Congress um I think in
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
in every term for as long as I've been
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
in this role so so for going on six
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
years now has considered versions of
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
bills that um that would have kind of
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
unified this it's certainly within
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
congress's Authority um and for one
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
reason or another they didn't gain
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
traction but that but that it's not
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
something that I think is lost on
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
Congress including New Hampshire's Cong
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation at least you
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
know four or five years ago when I was
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
interacting with them more directly
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
right after the Wayfair decision um and
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
so if there were folks who were
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
concerned I I do think that Congress is
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
the clearest way to to simplify this
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court noted that in
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
Wayfair and and um and it continues to
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
be the the clearest way to to create
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
uniformity across the country would be
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
through congressional action and I don't
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
think there's any real legal dispute
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
that Congress can do that um as a matter
 
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.349 align:start position:0%
that Congress can do that um as a matter
of

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%

thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%

that is all the pin cards I have for HP

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
our Pro business reputation are the
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
results of forward-thinking progrowth
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
policies like this one we know that when
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
we lower taxes we allow businesses to
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
keep more of their hard-earned money
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
which fuels investment job creation and
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
Innovation House Bill 155 continues that
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
tradition by delivering meaningful tax
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
relief to the businesses that drive our
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
economy and provide jobs for granted
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
Staters let me be clear this is not just
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
about cutting taxes it's about creating
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
Opportunity by reducing the BET rate we
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
are empowering businesses both large and
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
small to expand hire and invest in their
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
communities whether it's a local family
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
run shop or a larger Enterprise
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
employing hundreds this reduction
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
ensures that every business in New
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the resources they need to
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
grow and succeed economic activity is
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
not a zero sum game when businesses
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
Thrive the Ripple effects are felt far
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
and wide employees benefit from better
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
wages and more job opportunities local
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
economies are invigorated and our tax
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
base grows naturally ensuring that the
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
state has the resources it needs without
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
burdening taxpayers this is The Virtuous
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
cycle of growth that we know tax cuts
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
unleash critics May raise concerns about
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
the impact on Revenue but the evidence
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
is clear lower taxes lead to stronger
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
economic growth New Hampshire has proven
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
time and time again that reducing tax
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
burdens Fosters the type of dynamic
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
vibrant economy that benefits everyone
 
00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:38.799 align:start position:0%

increased economic activity

corresponding and corresponding revenue
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
from other sources that we expect
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
because of this policy and it really
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't factor in the BPT offset that
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
this policy would would still have in
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
place as stewards of New Hampshire's
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
future it is our duty to embrace
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
policies that position our state as the
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
premier destination for businesses
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
workers and families House Bill 155 is a
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
deliberate step in that direction
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
signaling to job creators that New
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is committed to their success
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
and open for business the message we
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
sent today is simple we believe in the
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
power of businesses to drive prosperity
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we trust the people of New Hampshire
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
to spend invest and innovate better than
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
government ever could I urge you to
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
support houseo 155 and help ensure that
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy remains a model
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
of growth opportunity and fiscal
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility and speaking for myself
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
as a member of the finance committee I
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
certainly know that any tax reductions
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
that are made in this committee uh will
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
be felt and responsible when we deal
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the state budget uh but I know that
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
we would be able to absorb such a cut
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
that this one represents uh thank you
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
for your time and I welcome any
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%

2000 or no it was
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
before uh it was in the 1990s I believe

be uh governor for one term Craig Benson
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh started a lawsuit against uh New
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we had put in a
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and it was being
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
paid almost entirely by the wealthiest
 
00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.510 align:start position:0%
paid almost entirely by the wealthiest
places

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
on that is how the
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
BET came to exist was that Governor
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
Merill decided that it was uh that we
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
had to solve this lawsuit by putting in
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
something that would be on all
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
businesses above a certain
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
threshold and we've maintained the
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
inflation effects on that threshold ever
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
since uh which do help the smaller
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to stay uh and
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
grow why would this not trigger
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
could this not trigger yet another of
 
00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.710 align:start position:0%
could this not trigger yet another of
those

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits thank you for the question I I
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
believe the initial rate of the bet when
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
it was introduced in the 90s was
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
0.125% if I'm not mistaken uh it has
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
grown exponentially from that point to
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
0.55 uh today this is a very modest
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
reduction to just
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
050 uh which is still well above what it
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
was when it was introduced to an answer
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
to that lawsuit um I'd be happy to
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor legislation with you
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative to bring it back down to
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
0.125% which was the original uh rate
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
for but this bill is a simply modest
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
reduction that I don't think brings us
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
in any uh trajectory or danger of
 
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.789 align:start position:0%
in any uh trajectory or danger of
triggering

00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
triggering
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if I could it was 025 025 your
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
your party increased it to 0. five is
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
there a and then 75 I think it was
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
we are now in a time when our revenues
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
are decreasing rather than
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
increasing and I'm wondering what you
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
think we ought to be on getting rid of
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
in order to do
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
this uh thank you for the question I
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
think there's a number of areas in state
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
government that the house finance
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
committee is looking at making
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
reductions at and I also commend the
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
governor for her Commission on
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
government efficiency that is also
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
examining a number of ways in which the
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
state government can become more
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
efficient and save taxpayer dollars uh
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a lot of potential
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
answers to that question as to where we
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
can find the the $22 million a year uh
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
that the analysis says this would uh
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
free up in taxation uh but we also know
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
that since 2015 uh We've T cut taxes
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
significantly in New Hampshire and we've
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
seen revenues grow year after year after
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
year uh so I'm confident that any
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
further tax reductions that we're able
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
to pursue in the long run will lead to
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
more economic growth and a and a
 
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
stronger tax base over time follow
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
up uh are you aware that all of the
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
growth that we've been seeing has been
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
floating on a sea of uh Republican and
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
then Democratic Federal stimulus
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
packages I I think I would just I
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
disagree with that assessment of what's
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
fueling the growth and I think it's the
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
growth in businesses in New Hampshire
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's particularly leading to increased
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
revenues for the business profits tax
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%

ORS thank you Mr chair the guy over
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
here that too yeah um I was just looking
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
at uh um the uh policy institute's uh or
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy institutes analysis of the
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax which shows some
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
23% uh reduction in revenues uh with a
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
concominant increase in profits and the
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
two offset each other and my
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bet is that that's
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
a tax on hiring
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
people so you're are you suggesting that
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
by reducing this by 05%
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're reducing the the cost of hiring
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
people which would then stimulate
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
businesses to hire people when there is
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
a monetary crush on the
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
business is have I gotten your argument
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
I I think that sums it up well
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you represent ORS
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good to see
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
you Joe my hero uh question for you is
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh I saw a presentation put on by the uh
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
AFP and a gentleman from Josiah Bartlett
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh I wish there was somebody here from
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
AFP that could uh maybe answer it oh
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
wait there is somebody here that's right
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
I do see him now sitting back there uh
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
but in that
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
presentation uh what I saw is data from
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire showing that as we've cut
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
the tax rate we've grown the revenue
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
especially to the general front and to
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund from 25% to 39%
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that I I am
 
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:01.039 align:start position:0%
representative and could you speak to as
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
to why that's happened maybe I I think
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
especially thank you for the question I
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
think we're in a special uh spot of the
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
country uh where we're a state that's
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
leading forward on more economic freedom
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
and lower lowering taxes while
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are going on the the
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
opposite direction the opposite path
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
where they're introducing new taxes
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
they're taxing millionaires out um and I
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
think all of that sort of our our our
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
ability to be that sort of economic
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
freedom is is in the Northeast has
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
really driven a lot of our our private
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
sector growth that is fueling uh
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
increased tax revenues um so when we can
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes we can grow revenues at the
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
same time thank you thank you represent
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you talk about
 
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.710 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you talk about
lowering

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
lowering
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
taxes one of the things that we can pick
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
and choose is how we Define things it's
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
true that it it may be true that state
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
taxes are diminishing but I can assure
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
you that in
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
Nashua which is the city I represent or
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
one one piece of it property taxes have
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
been going up pretty
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
consistently what happens is that the
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
state downshifts costs to people who are
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
paying property taxes I hear this from
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
my colleagues around the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
state and I
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
wonder how
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that property taxes are growing
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
growing pretty
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
consistently meshes with your statement
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
about taxes
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
lowering uh thank you for the question I
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
I would simply state that low taxes are
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
the result of low spending when it comes
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
to the local level and we have to have
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with our city councils our
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
town councils our school boards as to
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
what we're budgeting for what we're
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
spending locally I serve on the Salem
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
Town Council I know we examine every
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
dime uh that we can in Salem to keep
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes reasonable for residents
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so it is a conversation on property
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
taxes that largely is dictated by local
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
school boards local Town councils
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen uh and the voters who vote for
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
budgets and warrant articles that may
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
drive their taxes up um but I at the end
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the day low taxes would be the result
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
of low spending at the local level all
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
right so so may I follow up follow up so
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
I I want to clarify that the fact
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
that that your interpretation is despite
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
the state providing less Revenue to the
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
localities the problem is that
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
localities who are trying to maintain
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
services are the problem because we're
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
raising property taxes so that we can
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
fund the services that the state needs
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be is that true I I don't know if
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
that's true because you use the word
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
need and I think it's always a choice at
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
the local level as to whether they're
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to increase taxes or they're going
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
to cut spending so it's that
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that has to take place
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
locally as to what they want their
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
government to look like what they want
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
their tax rate to look like and that's
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
all up to local control and local
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
elected officials and local voters who
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
are supporting those policies and that
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
spending one
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
more one more followup and then one more
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
question from thank you Mr chair the
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
fact that the state is not supporting
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
public education we are the lowest State
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
support for per pupil for public
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
education in the entire country not
 
01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:28.039 align:start position:0%
something I'm proud of of and the fact
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
that my city nasua has had to pay $100
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
million to cover costs for retirement
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
benefits for First Responders that the
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
state had committed to and reneged on
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
apparently is a problem with nasua not
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing its job at managing its economics
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
is that true I would say all of that
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
spending you've just referenced were
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
decided locally to pursue that spending
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
levels the local governments can always
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
look to reduce spending if they want to
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
get tax relief tell that to our First
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
Responders represent opal yes thank you
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and uh thank you for taking
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
my question representative I I um wanted
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
to look back at a presentation we had
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
from the Josiah Bartlett Center um which
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
I found pretty pretty interesting um I
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
particularly found uh there were 12
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
slides that were
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
presented um
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
in in presenting these slides uh Mr
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
Klein was talking about economic freedom
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
and how nsha was rated highly on
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
economic freedom and in one chart it it
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
showed that the Commonwealth of
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was clearly not rated so
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
highly um I think
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
the organization that was presenting
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
that had a particular political bent but
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that aside in the very next
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
slide I was struck by the fact that uh
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
second uh in terms of growth of GDP
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
between 200 and
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
2023 would you care to guess who was
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
first having not seen the presentation
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to make an attempt to
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
guess at the the answer it was the
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth of
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts according to the slide
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
presented by Mr Klein theh abshire's GDP
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
growth over that 23-year period was 5
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
54 um while the Commonwealth of
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
61 over 23 years over those 23 years
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
correct I guess I would answer it as as
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
we've had a a a decent eight years for
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the last eight years
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
and we're continuing to grow on those
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
past eight years that would be my answer
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
follow up one last one last followup I
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't know of any significant policy
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
changes in either the Commonwealth or
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
frankly the state of New Hampshire even
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
in those 23 years but perhaps you
 
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.670 align:start position:0%
in those 23 years but perhaps you
do

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.549 align:start position:0%
do
taxes

01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
um no I'm not um we we still have three
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
more pink cards um and we're getting to
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
a point where we need to hear from them
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
um and I would just remind members that
 
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
um questions about the bill are fine we
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
should avoid how we feel about the
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
policy um thank you representative
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%

of maram Hillsboro 12 in 2022 I
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored a bill to cut the BPT and bet
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
and this committee amended the bill to
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
just cut a the BPT by a modest
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
amount um I the sponsor of this bill did
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
an exceptional job introducing the bill
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
talk speaking to it and answering
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
questions so I have nothing to add or
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
answer um I just wanted to be on record

to support the bill and I thank thank
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
Moore I love the comfy seed thanks for
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
the upgrade
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh hello my name is Greg Moore I am a
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
regional director with Americans for
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and uh I want to thank the
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing from me today uh
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
we are coming here in support of House
 
01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
we are coming here in support of House
Bill

01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
155 uh Americans for Prosperity began
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
the efforts in 2014 to really highlight
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's uncompetitively High
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
business tax rates at the time according
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
to the tax Foundation we were 48th
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
nationally we actually had our uh
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
corporate tax rate is half a point
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
higher than Massachusetts which is not a
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
distinction any of us I think would uh
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
carry as a badge of honor and subsequent
 
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
to that there's been five rounds of
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
relief for the business profits tax and
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
four rounds of relief to the business
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax as representative ner
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out she brought in legislation 3
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
years ago to reduce both the BPT and the
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
bet this committee chose the BPT uh at
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
the time I encouraged the committee to
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
focus on the BET as it impacts uh local
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
small businesses more more directly than
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the BPT um committee made a different
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
choice and you don't get to win everyone
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
so uh I would encourage you to really
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
focus on BET I don't want to be
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the sponsors uh the
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor I will say I will say in regards
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
to the question he received relative to
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh local
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
spending uh New Hampshire is sending a
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
record amount of money to local
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
governments record amounts both in
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
direct cash payments as well as in
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
education funding what has changed in
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
the last few years and I say this uh
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
because uh with America's Prosperity I
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually oversee the work of 16 States
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing this across the country
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that the the impact of The
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
Disappearance of federal money has made
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
a major impact on a lot of local
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
governments and a lot of local
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
governments uh did what they did what
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
happens when a A Rush of new money comes
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
in they spend up to the new money and
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
when that money disappears it has to be
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
made up by local tax dollars so I will
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
say that it's uh it's a byproduct of a
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
lot of Disappearing money that's that is
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
a fair statement but it's not State
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
money uh the state has been sending a
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
record amount of money to local
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
governments and has been for the last
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
few years so with that I'd be happy to
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
question we've had testimony or
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
presentations by a variety of groups
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
about finances one of which was the Bia
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
the business and industries
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
Association if the reduction of
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
taxes was CR a critical priority for
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
them can you help me to understand why
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
they are telling us that their
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
priorities are increased housing and
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
child care opportunities they are not
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
asking us for a reduction in taxes and
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to hear what your thoughts
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
are on that thank you for the question I
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it uh there'll be a speaker
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
after me uh who speaks for the national
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
Federation of Independent Business so I
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
think you'll get a very different
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
perspective from small business and from
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the larger businesses represented by the
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
Bia um small business obviously is
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
uniquely impacted by the BET versus the
 
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.590 align:start position:0%
uniquely impacted by the BET versus the
BP

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
BP
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I will say that that there's no
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
question that there are other challenges
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
facing the state of New Hampshire
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
housing is an enormous priority and then
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're and we at AFP are putting a large
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
focus on that in fact after I leave this
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to go to a lunch and
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're hosting with the uh
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
head of the National Association of home
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
builders to highlight that very issue so
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh two things can be true it I don't
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
think I don't live in a world where uh
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
just because one thing is a priority for
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
one group then therefore other things
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
are not a priority or that they will be
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
opposed I haven't seen any opposition
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
from the Bia to this legislation thank
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Southworth uh thank
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
you um just for my math a little bit I
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
think you are correct that New Hampshire
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
is currently um contributing the most to
 
01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh public education than it ever has
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
I've been here 10 years so I think that
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
is correct um would you also agree
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
though that our percent contribution is
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
the lowest in the United States and is
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
way off from some of the other
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring uh New England
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
states I will say that it that it is
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
lower than the other New England states
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
I could not say definitively if it's the
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
lowest I know that that uh a number of
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
the other New England states use other
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
direct taxes like sales taxes to
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
directly fund uh education so since we
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a sales or an income tax it
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
would be hard for us to utilize those
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
exist thank you for the question
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you uh Mr chair and
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I appreciate
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify in support of
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 155 today my name is John
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
Reynolds I'm the state director for the
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
Business in New Hampshire we represent
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
1700 over 1700 small businesses across
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
the state in every industry every
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
sector uh our members are typically very
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
small um and our mission is to promote
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
and protect their right to own operate
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and grow their business um I want to say
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
when I traveled around the state last
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
fall and this winter talking to our
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
members uh the number one thing I heard
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
from them is business taxes right they
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
have a lot of different problems and
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
challenges right now from uh trying to
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
find Qualified workers trying to pay
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
them more um you know making repairs
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
buying equipment you name it but the
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
number one thing the first thing out of
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
their mouth almost universally was was
 
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
the tax burden uh and then that shows up
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know in our surveys as well and one
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
thing I I want to hearken back to right
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
is uh Over The Last 5 Years small
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state across the
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
country have faced almost almost
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
unprecedented challenges at least in the
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
last 40 50 years and while the start of
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic kind of seems like it's
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
getting to be you know well in the
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
rearview mirror uh the reality for a lot
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
of our members uh we survey them
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
regularly we ask them questions about
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
their economic health and the state of
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the small business economy during the
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic we regularly surveyed them on
 
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
some unique questions and one of them
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
was uh how is covid affecting your sales
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
and it you know reported back like you
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
would expect in the first year or two
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
which are that you know half to 3/4s of
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
small businesses rep reported
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
significant declines in their sales but
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
I think what people don't necessarily
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
realize is that lingered on for a long
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
time we cut the last edition of that
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
survey was in January of 2023 and at
 
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
that point still a third of small
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
businesses were reporting that their
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
sales were down 25% or more compared to
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
pre pre- pandemic levels so digging out
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
of that whole um has looked a lot
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
different for a lot of our members a lot
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
of small businesses than than other
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
people uh which is why we support a
 
01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
reduction in the BET which to
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative ul's Point uh would allow
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
them to hopefully keep up put a little
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
bit more money back in the business
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
pocket to keep up with hiring to pay
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
their employees a little bit more to
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully retain them and attract new
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
ones to make repairs to buy new
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
equipment and invest back in their
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
business and and hopefully grow here or
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
allow more businesses start here and
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
continue to grow New Hampshire's economy
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
so uh we're happy to support uh House
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 155 thank representative Sweeney
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
for sponsoring it and I appreciate again
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to comment
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
today thank you representative elmy
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions if I could uh
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
one of them is Washington defines small
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
businesses as anything under 500 workers
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
that is a large business for New
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm wondering on what your
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
membership can actually consists of
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
within the New Hampshire version of what
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
small businesses are sure uh I mean uh
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you represent V me and Mr chair uh
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
80% of our members have fewer than 20
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
employees so when I say small I mean
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
very small you know talking hardware
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
stores small machine shops uh auto
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
repair stores uh small grocery stores
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a few General Stores um the US
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
small business administration does
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
Define small business across the board
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
generally as under 500 and then they
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
have industry specific categories that
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
range from 100 to 1500 employees
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
depending on what industry it is because
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
when you get into some specialized
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturing right you know you you you
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
could have a thousand employees and be
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
apple have a follow yeah thank you for
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
that I've been wondering for a long time
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the other question
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
is about whether you've had a
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with those people about
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
which taxes are their
 
01:15:02.679 --> 01:15:04.390 align:start position:0%
which taxes are their
problem

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
because uh there's quite a lot of
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
um people a lot of them are paying more
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
business than um uh property taxes than
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
they are any other
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
tax and do they regard are they talking
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
mostly about property tax or which are
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
growing because we are cutting we are
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
sending Services back down to the towns
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh to pay for or are they talking about
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
our business Enterprise taxs yeah I and
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
I represent Aly thank you for that
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
question um and that's something I would
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
like to dig into deeper with our members
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
and ask them specifically which burden
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
is the worst the most common answer I
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
get anecdotally is all of them uh
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know and any and any reduction any
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
relief whether it comes from property
 
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
taxes or or the Statewide uh bet BBT and
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
others um you know is very welcome and
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
then one other thing I did want to note
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
too you know at the end of this year a
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
really important Federal deduction the
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
federal small business deduction which
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
allows small business owners to deduct
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
20% of qualified business uh expenses
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
expires at the federal level and if that
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
goes away I mean that's going to have a
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
really detrimental impact on small
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
businesses in new Hamp sure um I hope it
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know we're working we have a
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
team in Washington that works very hard
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
on that I'm glad not to be here I'm very
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
glad to be here um but you know
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
certainly a reduction in the bet would
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
help offset the loss of that Federal
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
deduction representative ORS thank you
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
question so you may have touched on it
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
but you said that the small businesses
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
were really hurting due to the covid
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
where are they at presently have they
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
recovered or how far behind are they
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we um thank you uh reprentative for
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
the question uh we we stopped that P
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
specific pandemic era survey uh in Janu
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago this month um so I don't
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
have you know continuation of that where
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
their sales are but I just thought it
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
was striking that even three years into
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic that sales were still
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
significantly below pre-pandemic levels
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
for one and three small businesses um
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know what I would say right is uh
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
what I see in our current data we have a
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
great we have 300,000 members around the
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
country so we survey uh them regularly
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
every month kind of on this the health
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
of their businesses um and what they you
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
know continue to report are problems are
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
are wouldn't be a surprise right it's
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
inflation is one of the still one of the
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
top problems depending on what uh what
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
you do what line of business you're in
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues still might be a
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
problem for you and then uh the cost of
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
Labor and also availability of workers
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
right are just chronic problems that the
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic exacerbated thank you that are
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
still problems representative Southworth
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman thank you for
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um have you seen I
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
think it's from the Dr the chart that
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
shows where the tax reductions actually
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
go when we lower the taxes because it's
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
kind of an upside down triangle and the
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
top the big money is going to large okay
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
good so depending where you draw your
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
line about what's a small business you
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
can see on that chart that whatever
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past 10 years most of
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
the reductions have gone to
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations large
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
businesses New Hampshire and so on and
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
we we get that report from them uh every
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
two years when we do the budget so I
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted certainly I'm a strong
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
supporter of the small businesses but if
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
I look back I've been here 10 years most
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
them that's sort of a mix of a question
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
oh yeah sorry I was waiting I'm glad you
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
have that in front of you yeah no I I I
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
think it's a great chart thank you
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth for the for
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
the comment um I have not seen a
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
distribution of kind of you know buy uh
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
tax spur in or yeah I have not seen a
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
distribution of how this they have a
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
nice but I can you know you can pretty
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
easily do a back of the math calculation
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
and figure out that you know I just
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful information
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but say for 10 15 uh you know
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
employee businesses right you know
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether this saves them a few hundred
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
bucks or a few thousand bucks right
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's meaningful um so you know I'm not
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
knock it's it's meaningful to to our
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
thank you one last question from
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
represent elberger you miss thank you Mr
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
chair this is more of a Quest type of
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
question following up on representative
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
ORS I was struck by the fact that you
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
had stopped that survey in 2023 which
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
was sort of the end of the worst of the
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic and now I would ask if you can
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
do it again because I'm wondering
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
whether the responses might be
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
significantly different thank you happy
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
to we we are a uh uh I I like to think
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
of it as a lean But Mighty organization
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
but still lean so we kind of have to
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
shift our resources around when sort of
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
our our data research team is pretty
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
small but I will look and see what we
 
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
have and see if we can kind
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
of figure out sort of a line of where
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
sales are and where overall Business
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
Health is but as I mentioned to
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
represent or is you know it's it's the
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
concerns you all know
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
about thank you very

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
it um and a big part of that fiscal
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
crisis is the impact on our property
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um I had the opportunity as
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you did of going around
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
and talking to my constituents or my
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
those that I hoped would be my
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
constituents back last
 
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
fall and the number one issue that I
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
heard from them businesses and
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
individuals alike was property
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
taxes now it's easy to say well it's a
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
spending issue you know they just need
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
to vote differently but the fact of the
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
matter is uh we have a long tradition of
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
democratic decision making in this state
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
that is actually fairly
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
unique um and I take some issue with
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
people who suggest that voters in a
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
community who make a a
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
decision um are are somehow
 
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.270 align:start position:0%
decision um are are somehow
wrong

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
um those voters are doing their best to
 
01:23:16.239 --> 01:23:18.110 align:start position:0%
um those voters are doing their best to
provide

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
resources that this state is not has not
 
01:23:21.639 --> 01:23:22.510 align:start position:0%
resources that this state is not has not
been

01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
providing and that's not just my opinion
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's the opinion of several Court
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
years that's issue one issue two is the
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
fact that New Hampshire businesses are
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
not competing on a Level Playing Field
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
with multinational corporations
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
particularly foreign
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
corporations who continue to have the
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
ability to profit
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
shift and there are those who will say
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
well the tax cut and jobs Act of 2017
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
solved this problem it
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
didn't study after study has shown that
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
corporations multinational corporations
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
continue to use property or profit
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
shifting uh to lower or in some cases
 
01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
shifting uh to lower or in some cases
evade

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
evade
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
taxation um that's not a Level Playing
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
Field if I have a the Hampshire business
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'm paying my full liability tax
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
liability um it's a fairly simple
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
process to say shouldn't
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
everybody based on their activity here
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hamshire what this bill would do is
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
called complete corporate
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
reporting and it is true that no state
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
at this moment uses complete corporate
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
reporting alone but 11 states do offer
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
it as an option and the state of
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
Alaska requires oil companies to use
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
complete corporate
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
reporting to apportion their taxes owed
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the state of Alaska so this is not a
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
unique Concept in fact in the
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
1980s a number of States including the
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire had what was then
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
called worldwide combined
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
reporting it is the same idea as
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
complete reporting and we in fact
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
require compan ianes who do business in
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to provide us their
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
combined reporting for their activity
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
domestically the only thing we say is
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take a look beyond
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
the water's
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
edge and that enables companies to
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
continue to do what some call
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
euphemistically transfer pricing what we
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
all know as profit
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
shifting uh to low tax or no tax
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions like Ireland or the became
 
01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions like Ireland or the became
in

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.709 align:start position:0%
in
Islands

01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
Islands
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
um there was a study done by The
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
Institute for Taxation and economic
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
policy in
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
2019 that said this was a17 billion
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
problem for the
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
country and 177
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
million uh loss of income for the State
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know of any study more
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
recent than that
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
but I do know that study exists and
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot
 
01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.669 align:start position:0%
there are a lot
of

01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotal and theoretical discussions
 
01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
about what this would do whether it
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
would produce more revenue or not I'm
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
sure there would be winners and losers
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
as Dr said uh but the fact of the matter
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
is there is at least one documented
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
study that suggests this would produce
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
significant income for the State of New
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without impos imposing a new
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
tax simply by requiring everyone to play
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
by the same
 
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.350 align:start position:0%
by the same
rules

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
um and with that Mr chair I'll be happy
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
to try and answer any questions I'm not
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
an accountant I'm not a lawyer but I do
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
know what's fair thank you
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative Spar Spire thank you Mr
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
chair you say that they're shifting uh
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
these corporations large multinationals
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
are shifting profits uh to foreign
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
countries because of tax
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
purposes um what is uh the federal
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
government doing about that because
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
they're I would think they're trying to
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know that these corporations are
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
doing that because they don't want to
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
pay federal taxes not necessarily the
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire correct that is
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
correct there have been um uh at the
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
federal level there have been several
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
efforts um uh the the tax cut and jobs
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
act considered you know included
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
Provisions that were trying to claw back
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
um primarily jobs and and companies that
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
had moved
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
overseas uh there's also something
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
called guilty which I forget exactly
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
acronym um stands for but an effort to
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
to uh to tax some of this profit
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
shifting but there are several studies
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
that have shown that it it has not done
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it has not done what it hoped to do
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know uh ending the
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
profit shifting and and and allowing or
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
making sure the companies were paying
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
their fair share I know there are
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
several States um state of Oregon state
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
of Minnesota almost passed this uh the
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
state of Maine and the state of Vermont
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
and the state of Rhode Island all looked
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
at it
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that for example the
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
state of Minnesota it it passed one
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
chamber of their legislature and was
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
about to pass another and um there was
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
significant lobbying activity um
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
and somehow it
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
failed so there have been efforts at
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
both the Fate State yeah both the
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
federal and and many state levels uh to
 
01:29:06.639 --> 01:29:09.229 align:start position:0%
federal and and many state levels uh to
change

01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
Lori thank you for taking my question
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
you also testified at the commission
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
hearing that was chaired by uh um Mr
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
attorney spillsbury formerly of this
 
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
attorney spillsbury formerly of this
committee

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
um appreciate that and I'll ask a
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
similar question that I asked at that
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
time why does New Hampshire
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
care about a company that's in New
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and hires
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
people about a ship building operation
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
that is within the same
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation 6,000 miles
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
away that we would have that our Dr
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
would have to receive a report on and
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate to to determine it seems to me
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
that this particular Bill while being
 
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
fair would place an unfair burden on
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
large corporations to do increasing
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
amount of work in making New
 
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
amount of work in making New
Hampshire

01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
less popular place for large
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
multinationals to come and spend their
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
money well representative oy thank you
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
for your question um uh a couple things
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh first first of all I would suggest
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the argument that this is going to
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
place an unfair burden in terms of
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements on large
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
companies um if companies aren't already
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
collecting this data then my suspicion
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
is um it's either really egregiously
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
poor oversight on the part of the
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
company and its leadership um and that
 
01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
company is probably not long for for
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
business if they're not already
 
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.790 align:start position:0%
business if they're not already
understanding

01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
what their Global you know what the what
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
the scope of their operations are it's
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
also true that um in many other
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions including the European
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
Union for example these kinds of reports
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
are required so companies are already
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
gathering this this data now to the
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
first part of your question why is it
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
why would we care um I think we would
 
01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:19.870 align:start position:0%
why would we care um I think we would
care

01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
because whether it's tax policy or any
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
other issue that deals with
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the rule of
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
law ultimately what holds that up is an
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
understanding on the part of all
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
citizens that it will be applied equally
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
and fairly and if I have a New Hampshire
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
business and I'm being taxed at a
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
certain rate on all of my
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
sales um then it seems to me Eros ER in
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
potentially of my confidence in that
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
system if I'm allowing a multinational
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
corporation to use what are now
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly legal I will admit but I think
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
unfair accounting
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
techniques to transfer profits from
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire to uh a lower tax
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction let me give you one
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
example um the pharmaceutical industry
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
is sort of famous for this where a a
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
drug will be developed let's say and I'm
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to use OIC not because I want to
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
attack that drug or that company but I
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
just it's a drug we're all familiar with
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
advertising if if pharmaceutical company
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
X develops OIC and achieves $100 million
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
US that company's headquarters in the
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
Cayman Islands then charg es the US
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
affiliate a licensing fee to sell
 
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
ozempic and that licensing fee even
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
though the company has no employees or
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
or few employees in the Cayman Islands
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
and they had nothing to do with
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
developing or marketing the drug that
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
licensing fee then sucks a substantial
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
profit and suddenly that all those 100
 
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars in sales become
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
significantly less when it comes time
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
for our deal
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
or any other state taxing Authority or
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh to consider
 
01:33:29.679 --> 01:33:35.149 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh to consider
their

01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
liability representative ORS thank you
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you rep for uh taking
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
my question so I you know I've read
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
through this uh I I have to admit I
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
can't seem to get my head around it and
 
01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
being a controller a vice president of
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
Finance someone who's done taxes across
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
state lines I find this uh extremely
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
difficult to follow uh but my first
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
question is I I couldn't understand
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about leveling the
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
playing field and a complete corporate
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
reporting and so on what is complete
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
corporate reporting I mean it sounds
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
like you're asking to change the tax
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
code I mean do you know how many
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
millions of pages the tax code is
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
already I mean I'm not sure where you're
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
going with this other than that you're
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
trying to increase taxes on
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
businesses which could drive them out of
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so mik what is what is the
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
goal here there's so much going on here
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
I mean can you and give me in like five
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
bullet points what you're trying to
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
do I I will certainly try representative
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um the goal
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
is very simple um if you're a company
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire and
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
you're also doing business around the
 
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.629 align:start position:0%
you're also doing business around the
world

01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
all this asks is that you provide the
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
data that says okay we had you know 100
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
million in sales
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
globally and our sales in New
 
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
globally and our sales in New
Hampshire

01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
were I can't do the math in my head but
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a million dollars right
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that's 1% of my Global
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
sales okay so that would be based on
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
your your tax liability would be based
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
based on that calculation 1% of your
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
Global sales as opposed
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
to being enabled through accounting
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
techniques to take that million dollars
 
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
in profit and shift it elsewhere and we
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't look beyond the water's edge
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently and
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
so uh you know it's a it's a different
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
calculation if we can't compare what you
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
what your the totality the complete
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
report of of your operations this this
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill this change would have no effect on
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh any businesses that are not
 
01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.590 align:start position:0%
uh any businesses that are not
multinational

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
multinational
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
corporations um
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
and well I'm sure I enjoy uh purchasing
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
from multinational corporations like
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
Amazon um I'm I'm not going to feel
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
sorry for them having to add another
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
accountant a lawyer or two um and the
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
and as I say I think most of this
 
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.109 align:start position:0%
and as I say I think most of this
information

01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
if not all of it they're already
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
collecting they're just not sharing it
 
01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
collecting they're just not sharing it
with

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
Dr um follow follow so last year uh I
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
believe representative shamberg had a
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with waterers Edge and
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
taxing and again it was so complicated I
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't I couldn't get my head around
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
it and I've already mentioned my
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
background uh I spoke with a gentleman a
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative used to be on ways and
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
means I wish he was here uh spillsbury I
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
think is last name is and uh yeah I saw
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
you back there but uh you know he tried
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
to explain it to me and I think he's a
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
pretty sharp guy for a Republican and uh
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know I could I still couldn't
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
understand it I mean this this sounds to
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
me like I mean we're already generating
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
these businesses are already gen
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
generating tax reports why can you not
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
get the information from their tax
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
reporting which is quite substantial
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
having been in this Arena
 
01:37:25.229 --> 01:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
because under current
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
law we're essentially prohibited from
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
looking beyond the water's edge so any
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
activity by a multinational corporation
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
that takes place and Waters Edge I guess
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
is sort of a euphemism because I you
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
know it includes any International
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
including Canada or Mexico um we can't
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
that can't be considered
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
um so so we don't have the information
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
and we can't get the information that's
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
you know that's as simple and again I
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
will say that I think the issue here and
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
I highly respect repres representative
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and we had several
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
conversations about this um we don't we
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
don't agree we I think we've agreed to
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
disagree um but the fact of the matter
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
is uh it is not that complicated when
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
you look at it at it at its heart all
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're asking for is companies to provide
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
100% of the information of their
 
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.910 align:start position:0%
100% of the information of their
activities

01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
so that they can pay their full tax
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
liability to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
just like every New Hampshire business
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
has to do so we're just that's the level
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
of playing field your business if you're
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire you pay
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
your taxes uh if you're a multinational
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
you have means of of lowering that tax
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill and again it is currently legal but
 
01:38:52.589 --> 01:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
I don't think that makes it right I I
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
think it is it is legal excuse me follow
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one comment is I
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
think the solution is we need to change
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
the tax code if that's what you want to
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
do but I'm glad we cannot see past the
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
water's edge thank
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm going to take one more
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
question and then I know representative
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
spilsbury is here and he's also in a
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh meeting so yes
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative shamber uh thank you Mr
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking this
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
question uh representable
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
itself it became more complicated when I
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
was asked to add some additional issues
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
into the bill by outside
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
sources and I excuse me uh you'll have
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
to suspend you are on the bill you
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
should not be asking questions I can't
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
ask any question now oh sorry about that
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask about an amendment
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that till later okay if
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
if if May Mr chairman Just One Last
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
Point um what I failed to mention and
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
and is uh it it it is the intention of
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
Representative shamberg and myself if
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity um we got this
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
this last draft fairly late and there
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
was additional information um or
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
additional issues that were added
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the Statewide property tax
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
and um and issues related to the
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax that uh
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I believe introduced
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
last year he has now we found out I
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
found out yesterday that he has now
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
reintroduced that Bill separately and so
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
there are provisions of this bill that
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
we would seek to amend and strike um and
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
his bill is being heard by uh another
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee later this week is my
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
understanding so it's probably more
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for those issues to be dealt
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
with separately and removed from 502 so
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we can focus on the issue of uh
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
complete reporting thank
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
much all right uh next I've got
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury I saw him
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
filling out a pink card and the only
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
other pin card I have is Dr which we'll
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
invite them if there's further questions
 
01:41:14.159 --> 01:41:21.350 align:start position:0%
invite them if there's further questions
thank

01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
you good morning w and Means Committee
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
I've been missing you this topic uh
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
certainly brings me back to the last two
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
terms um I
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
would strongly ask you to itl this bill
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
I did notice it was more complex and I'm
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to confine what I'm going to
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
address simply to the worldwide combined
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
reporting uh we don't do commissions on
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
very many of our topics ICS two terms
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
ago we were asked to pass a bill to
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
commission and a commission meaning both
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate and the house as
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
well as a variety of outside
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
interests and give this a thorough study
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
and uh I was appointed to that and by
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
happen stance found myself as chairman
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
which I didn't anticipate but it
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
certainly forced me to take a deep dive
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
and I just want to uh ask uh the
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
chairman please to circulate the
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
commission's report and I want to ask
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
each of you to please take the time to
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
read the majority uh report is 16 pages
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
long it will give you the most
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh review of the topic I
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
think that you can find anywhere and if
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
you really want to go further uh the
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
report includes uh a very extensive uh
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
several page bibliography
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
I don't imagine that there are many of
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
you who want that but it's there I've
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
had many
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
compliments uh from people involved in
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
tax conferences and other states for the
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Clarity of that report and
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that I went out
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
of my way as chairman of that to make
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it touched every single issue
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
that surfaced regardless of whether it
 
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
was in favor or in
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
opposition they're spelled out what each
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
of the people who testified including Mr
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
Opel is laid out and it's a it's not a
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
transcript but it'll give you a very
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
very clear idea of what was said uh
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
during the various uh hearings and
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
held we basically when we tax business
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
in income are asked to tax what happens
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we know the world is
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
complicated and so we have allocation
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
formulas apportionment
 
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
formulas those add an enormous level of
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
complexity to business tax law when you
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
take those apportionment formulas and
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
you apply to the business activity
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
across 50
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
states that adds enormously to the
 
01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.390 align:start position:0%
states that adds enormously to the
complexity

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
and in fact the complexity in in is such
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we have different laws in the
 
01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
different states entirely different
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
approaches to taxing
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
businesses and we've recently uh tried
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
to simplify that apportionment formula
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire by going to the
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor this was to simplify
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
a ridiculously complex
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
process what worldwide combined
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
reporting would do is it would blow the
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
complexity up to an entirely different
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
level and for that
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
reason no State applies worldwide
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
combined reporting with the single
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
exception that in
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
Alaska they apply it exclusively to the
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
oil and gas
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
industry it's not that the other states
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
haven't considered it in fact just in
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
the last half dozen years proposal
 
01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:25.639 align:start position:0%
similar to this have failed in Minnesota
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
Maine Rhode Island Indiana and those um
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
those legislative activities are also um
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
addressed and links to them in our
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
report but most importantly the federal
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
government does not use worldwide
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
combined reporting the federal
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
government since the business tax was
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
created applies an arms length
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
adjustment process
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's very textured it's multivariant
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's subjective and it gives the IRS the
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
tools to make adjustments for things
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
such as royalties and licenses and
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual property and that's how the
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
United States government satisfies
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
itself that it's getting its fair share
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
of corporate income tax now the beauty
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire uh business tax is
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
that we use the federal tax return as a
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
Point of
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
Departure and you take your adjusted um
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh or your net taxable income and you
 
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
make certain limited
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
adjustments I don't want to go into all
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
the rationals in the description I want
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
to urge you to read the report the level
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
of complexity that comes when you say we
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
need to know what happened in New
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how to tax it and we're
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
going to find that out by learning and
 
01:47:01.149 --> 01:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
inquiring about the entire worldwide
 
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
operations of multinational corporations
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
is insane and for our state to do it
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
when no other state does it and when the
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
federal government isn't doing it means
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to get no assistance from
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
anybody the Dr testified to the
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission when we asked them what would
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
this involve the answer was more more
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
more of everything more staff more
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
training more tools more travel budget
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
Etc I
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is based on a conceptual
 
01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.229 align:start position:0%
think that this is based on a conceptual
theoretical

01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
theoretical
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
problem I think that the tools already
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
available through arms length adjustment
 
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.870 align:start position:0%
available through arms length adjustment
are

01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
ample I think that um steps being taken
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
recently in the uh oecd and the
 
01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
international environment are also
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
addressing this I think the fact that we
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
tax guilty
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
income and foreign earned
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
dividends dramatically mitigates the
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
problem the problem isn't sufficient to
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
Warrant the level of Warrant the level
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
of complexity that the bill would
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
require so the commission report doesn't
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
deny the existence of the problem or its
 
01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.709 align:start position:0%
deny the existence of the problem or its
potential

01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
but it very much puts it into scale this
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
is not worth doing for New Hampshire if
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
I thought that there was a sufficient
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
amount of cheating and that we really
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
had another source of income I would
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
have supported it but after all that the
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
commission went through I concluded that
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
on balance it could not be supported and
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
I think it's very unfortunate after that
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
level of study and after the vote that
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
was taken last term that it's come back
 
01:48:52.239 --> 01:48:54.990 align:start position:0%
was taken last term that it's come back
please

01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
itl uh what was the vote on that
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
commission the vote of the commission
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
was 7 to one I
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
believe to not to not do this 7 to one
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea of worldwide
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
combined reporting thank
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair nice to see
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
you again representative thank you
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
represent Elber
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
I believe and please correct me if I'm
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
wrong that at some point during our
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
conversations last
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
year uh we got information
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
about the effective tax rate for a local
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
business doing a similar business to an
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
international company and what the
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of tax rate was do
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
you recall that or is this something I'm
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
making up I'm I'm not recalling the
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion but when we say tax rates 7
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
and a
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
half% but in follow up what I'm trying
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
to remember
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
is did we ascertain or come up with the
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the notion that a local business was in
 
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
effect paying more than an international
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
corporation no I don't I don't know how
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
you could make that calculation or how
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
you would impute that outcome I mean
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
that from a the standpoint of available
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
facts in
 
01:50:25.239 --> 01:50:27.589 align:start position:0%
facts in
mathematics

01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
um what we know is that the net taxable
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
income is subjected to the same rate
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of what sort of a business or
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
business okay followup
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
follow it sounds to me as though you're
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
saying that the major objection to doing
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
something like this is that it would be
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
difficult is is that a correct
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation I I think that's a fair
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation and and I don't mean to
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
say that it's the only reason for not
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
doing it but I do agree that it's the
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
major reason for not doing it so if you
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
please read the report 16 Pages doesn't
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
take that long and I know it's a little
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
dreary but you are the tax committee um
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
the the complexity in uh accounting
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
rules which veryy country to Country in
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
currencies in languages in regulatory
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
regimes in tax codes is so great I
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
worked for a corporation that was in 78
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
countries I just can't even imagine how
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
that company could have squarely
 
01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
complied with this so when you have
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
something that involves as much
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in so far as the potential
 
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
benefit then I think you really do need
 
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
to weigh the certainty of how complex
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
and involved it would be not only in
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the resources that would be
 
01:52:01.629 --> 01:52:01.639 align:start position:0%
required of the
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
tax uh reporting entity but also of our
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much it's good to
 
01:52:18.069 --> 01:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
visit good to have you
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
here all right uh last um Lee but not
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
least I will invite Dr up well actually
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
let ask does do people have questions of
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
please good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Jennifer Ramsey I'm
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
tax policy Council for
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you and I'm looking forward to
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
soup because it's cold outside yes it
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
is you just heard representative
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
spillsbury talk about the cost to
 
01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.550 align:start position:0%
spillsbury talk about the cost to
operate

01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
this and I seem to recall that some
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
testimony was given both in the
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
commission and in the committee
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
regarding that cost what would be the
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
administrative cost to
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
review the
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
entire combined reporting
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
of even a small multinational
 
01:53:20.239 --> 01:53:22.830 align:start position:0%
of even a small multinational
corporation

01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:53:26.189 --> 01:53:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative ol I did sign up to speak
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
today because I had a couple of
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
um texal uh issues I wanted to bring to
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
your attention regarding the bill but
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
also I wanted to be sure that you uh
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
understood um Dr is not taking a
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
position with respect to this um with
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
this bill but uh we did want to be sure
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
to that you understood that there would
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
be a cost associated with administering
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
and implementing it um so we have taken
 
01:53:51.149 --> 01:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
a look at what it would take to
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
implement the bill uh we would need to
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
develop new forms um there is a
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
challenge with respect to section four
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill because uh as representative
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
spillsbury said um we currently start
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
from a line on the federal tax return um
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
but that line does not include um all of
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
the entities that this bill would expand
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
to include so that would probably no
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
longer be the right place to start so
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's a a logistical problem with with
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
that that that I would ask you all to
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
give some thought to um other than that
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think our cost would be in expanding
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
our audit division to try to figure out
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
how to audit um these taxpayers and we
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
estimated for purposes of the fiscal
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
note that that would would uh at a kind
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
of an intermediate level of auditing
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
would add three Auditors to our staff we
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
would need to contract initially at
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
least for services from professionals
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
that had foreign language expertise and
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
foreign U tax expertise um and there
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
would be additional travel costs uh
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
the the amount that we um estimated for
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
those costs would be in fiscal 26 an
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
additional uh m 164,000 in fiscal 27 an
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
additional M26 63,000 and in fiscal year
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
Robi yes I have a question it was said
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
that um this already exists in the
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
European Union but um legally could we
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh require this
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
only of the United States and the
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
European Union or and whatever other
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
group already had a
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
robust uh audit system of their own um
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I do think you could
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
um do this or something like this um it
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
would simply be a question of the
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
it right
 
01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:23.669 align:start position:0%
it right
represent

01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
elberger M thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
question how much do you are you
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
estimating would be the the cost I'm not
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
talking about the Personnel but the cost
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
of trying to implement this um so the
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
additional personnel and the uh cost for
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
contracted Services as well as travel
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
costs were the numbers that I just
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
provided earlier in add addition to that
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
um modifying the tax forms and creating
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh the portal I think was something we
 
01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:01.719 align:start position:0%
believed we could absorb um within our
 
01:57:01.719 --> 01:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
believed we could absorb um within our
ordinary

01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
ordinary
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
expenses of the
 
01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.109 align:start position:0%
expenses of the
agency

01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
and follow and I'm sorry
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
followup is this the chart you're
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
referring to here says uh for fiscal
 
01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.950 align:start position:0%
referring to here says uh for fiscal
2026

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
2026
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
1.64 uh a million 164 yes it's it's in
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note um I'm not sure if
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's made it to you yet I know uh it
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
was not originally attached to the bill
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you have the updated
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal fiscal note that was sent to the
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
house clerk but it's now in the fiscal
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
note as well as in the fiscal note quick
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
guide that we provided uh yesterday all
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
right uh followup follow up so we're
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
looking at a cost of
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
let's a million and a half
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
chances are that if we were to do
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
something like this to spend the money
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
and the training and all of that we'd
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
get a whole lot more than a million and
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
a half so I mean it it it just I
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
recognize the expense but I'm wondering
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether it might not be worth the
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
expense for the gain the we have not uh
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
attempted to estimate the gain I think
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
the belief is that there would be some
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
winners and some losers as
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury said um but
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
certainly if you all believe that this
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
would be a huge Revenue generator then
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
um I I follow your thought thought
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
process um it's it's just not something
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we would have a a way to estimate
 
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.069 align:start position:0%
that we would have a a way to estimate
thank

01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
you okay uh represent El me
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
yeah what we'd be looking at wouldn't it
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
be was would be we've got this bucket
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
of that that is the entire Corporation
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
we knew about this part of it down here
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the amount of Revenue that came in
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
from this part down here would be
 
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
divided by
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
um would be a result of of how much
 
01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:31.639 align:start position:0%
revenue they they got in New Hampshire
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
itself divided by the rest of that that
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
bucket piece of the bucket are you
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
speaking about the apportionment rules
 
01:59:42.669 --> 01:59:42.679 align:start position:0%
yes I think what you're saying is
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
correct with respect to apportionment um
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
that we do look right now at a unitary
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
group of of related corporations files a
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
single uh Waters Edge combined tax
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
return starts from the income for the
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
whole group and then a portions the
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
amount to New
 
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now based on Strictly on the
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire versus the sales
 
02:00:13.149 --> 02:00:13.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere um that's what representative
 
02:00:13.159 --> 02:00:14.350 align:start position:0%
everywhere um that's what representative
spillsbury

02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
meant if I could sure on everywhere
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
inside the United States correct so if
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
we used the whole bucket we would also
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
be having to use the
 
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.310 align:start position:0%
be having to use the
entire

02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue um gained from the whole bucket
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
So when you say the whole bucket are you
 
02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
talking about companies outside of the
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
waterers Edge group Outside The Waters
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
Edge group yes so um so we would be
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
again dividing what was New
 
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's to the entire
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
world and wouldn't there be some risk
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
there that New Hampshire relative to the
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
entire world was a smaller amount of
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
money than New
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relative to the US I think
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at if I understand
 
02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
it is the idea that there would be some
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
any more questions for
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
Dr okay seeing none thank you very much
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman may I may I point out
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
just really quickly two other small
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
section

02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
five of the the bill there's an
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
authorization uh to Dr to engage in
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting tax
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
practices um my audit team is telling me
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
they think that that would more
 
02:02:01.069 --> 02:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately belong in RSA 77 A2 or
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
A6 um and then also in section six of
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
the bill there's a definition of foreign
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
dividends um that is modified but I
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe you would need a
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
definition of foreign dividends anymore
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
because that would be included in
 
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
because that would be included in
foreign

02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else who would like
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
to testify on HB
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
502 seeing none we'll close the public
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
502 okay that concludes
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
the schedule for this morning so we will
 
02:02:59.709 --> 02:02:59.719 align:start position:0%

commission a commission Terry is very
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
good and that that commission voted 7 to
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
one and it was bip
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%

committee thank you for uh me me to
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
introduce the house bill 417 uh which
 
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
seeks to lower the communication
 
03:05:57.550 --> 03:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
Services tax in its first year and
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
repeal it entirely in the second this
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
proposal reflects a commitment to Fair
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
taxation administrative Simplicity and
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
reducing unnecessary burdens on New
 
03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's residents and businesses uh
 
03:06:11.469 --> 03:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
this testimony represents My Views and
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
most importantly the views and interests
 
03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
of my constituents in the towns of
 
03:06:16.510 --> 03:06:16.520 align:start position:0%

03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of any private employer uh nor
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
should it be construed to represent the
 
03:06:27.990 --> 03:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
views of any of my employers uh the
 
03:06:30.510 --> 03:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax today first
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
of all lacks a clear purpose uh or
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
incentive it's a relic of a bygone era
 
03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
enacted when telecommunications were a
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
luxury rather than an essential utility
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh communication services today are
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
Necessities for everyday life whether
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
for work education or social engagement
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
unlike other taxes designed to
 
03:06:52.750 --> 03:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize or discourage certain
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors the CST serves no broader
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
policy purpose and it arbitrarily
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
singles out communication services to
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue without aligning with a
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
public policy goal second the tax is
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
regressive the CST disproportionately
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
impacts low-income residents
 
03:07:12.870 --> 03:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
communication services are essential and
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
low-income households spend a larger
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of their income on these
 
03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
services compared to wealthier
 
03:07:20.590 --> 03:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
households by increasing the cost of
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
living for those least able to afford it
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
this tax exacerbates Financial
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
inequality in our state third it is an
 
03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
administrative complexity and a burden
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
on businesses it is complex for the
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
communication service providers
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
themselves to administer these vendors
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
are so frustrated with the complexity of
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
determining what is taxable and what is
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
exempt particularly when it comes to the
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
exclusion that we introduced a few years
 
03:07:49.710 --> 03:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
ago around internet services which are
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to be you know excluded of
 
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
course both with our law and with
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
federal law that they simply Tax
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
Services which shouldn't be covered and
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
when challenged admit their error and
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
continue to pay the tax anyway because
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
they cannot get their their systems
 
03:08:07.710 --> 03:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
right on the billing side for smaller
 
03:08:10.030 --> 03:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and startups the burden of
 
03:08:12.269 --> 03:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
compliance creates just one more barrier
 
03:08:14.790 --> 03:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
to entry stifles competition and
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
innovation in New Hampshire's economy
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire takes pride in its low tax
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
environment particularly uh when it
 
03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
comes to these kind of taxes that are
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
not apportion to a particular use or to
 
03:08:32.349 --> 03:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
align to a particular public policy
 
03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
purpose repealing the CST reinforces our
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
commitment to being an attractive state
 
03:08:39.630 --> 03:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
for residents and businesses and in an
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
era where remote work and digital
 
03:08:44.429 --> 03:08:44.439 align:start position:0%
connectivity are increasingly important
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
reducing the cost of communication
 
03:08:48.030 --> 03:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
Services makes new New Hampshire even
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
more appealing to businesses and to
 
03:08:54.670 --> 03:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
individuals seeking to relocate the bill
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh before you takes a phased approach
 
03:08:58.710 --> 03:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
which is a deliberate choice to balance
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility with the need for
 
03:09:03.389 --> 03:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
reform reducing the tax in the first
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
year allows time to evaluate and adjust
 
03:09:09.150 --> 03:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
for Revenue impacts while giving time to
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
transition smoothly full repeal in the
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
second year provides Clarity and
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
certainty for all stakeholders this
 
03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
approach ensures we can responsibly
 
03:09:20.910 --> 03:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
manage the budgetary implications while
 
03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
moving towards a fairer and more
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
Equitable tax
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
structure I urge the committee to
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
recommend HP 417 for passage and I'm
 
03:09:33.309 --> 03:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
happy to yield to questions thank
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you do we have
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
Aly thank
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
you I sympathize with you about
 
03:09:45.309 --> 03:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
communication Services text though I do
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
not understand how you know
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh about the effect of the complexities
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
on the the uh large uh corporations that
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
are paying it at this point it seems to
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
me that they're doing a pretty good job
 
03:10:05.110 --> 03:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
of hiding most of the cost that used to
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
be in the phone
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
tax uh beforehand could you explain how
 
03:10:14.910 --> 03:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
you arrived at all this knowledge well
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to and I certainly don't
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
pretend to be as well informed about uh
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
this source of Revenue as I'm sure many
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh folks on this committee are that have
 
03:10:26.229 --> 03:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
been on this committee for a good while
 
03:10:28.710 --> 03:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
um I did ask the legislative research
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
team to get me some information and even
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
they were unable to turn up as much
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
information as I might have liked what I
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you from my personal experience
 
03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh in dealing with uh Consolidated
 
03:10:46.389 --> 03:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
Communications is that uh in some cases
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh they explicit ly charge uh this tax
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
against Services which are data services
 
03:10:57.510 --> 03:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
that are used exclusively for internet
 
03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
um and the the reason behind that is a
 
03:11:02.269 --> 03:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
is a conversation that I've had at
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
length with their attorneys and and with
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
others and I use that example not to
 
03:11:09.030 --> 03:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
single them out as a bad actor I'm
 
03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
singling them out as an example because
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
to your point they found it to be
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
sufficiently complex and sufficiently
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
different than the billing systems that
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
they have off the shelf uh for for use
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
in other states as well um that they
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
basically turned around to me and said
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
well you know the the this is a few
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
years ago the $460 a year uh that I was
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
paying in New Hampshire communication
 
03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
Services tax uh we will make you whole
 
03:11:40.990 --> 03:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
for that by reducing our cost to you uh
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
but we're still going to render it to
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
the state because we can't figure out
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
how to fix it in our systems it's absurd
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
and and I think what you see is you see
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
today that there are some people who are
 
03:11:54.030 --> 03:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
charged for internet services where of
 
03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
course they're not charge this tax
 
03:11:58.269 --> 03:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
because the companies know not to charge
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
it on internet but under the covers uh
 
03:12:03.389 --> 03:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
those internet service providers are
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
often having to use Communications links
 
03:12:08.429 --> 03:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
where they are paying this tax and it
 
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
creates this this hidden uh complexity I
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
think was the word I used and I think
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's a fair word to
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
use followup good I have a a followup on
 
03:12:23.950 --> 03:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
this what bothers me is that um there
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
are several bills that are trying to cut
 
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
down different pieces of the revenue
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
we've got while the revenue is being
 
03:12:36.110 --> 03:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
reduced Naturally by the end of the
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
federal stimuli and um wouldn't it be
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
more logical to cut these Services once
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
we know what we can can uh reduce the
 
03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
cost of government to rather than
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
before so I I imagine this is a an
 
03:13:01.630 --> 03:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
answer that you hear frequently on this
 
03:13:03.870 --> 03:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh and in the finance
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
committees um my point of view is that
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
the way to manage a budget is
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
twofa first of all you should not spend
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
more than you bring in and second of all
 
03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
you should be prudent around what you're
 
03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
spending and I am looking forward this
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
year to us being exceptionally prudent
 
03:13:26.190 --> 03:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
with what we're spending uh I defer to
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
this committee to understand whether or
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
not we can afford to remedy uh this
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
concern now uh but I do believe as I
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
said that uh this
 
03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
um this Revenue source which has been
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
trending down for a number of years and
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
I know it's reported in the fiscal note
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
is currently $30 million uh was uh $50
 
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
million or so only a few years ago uh we
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
we know that this is not going to be uh
 
03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
A continuing $30 million per random
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source anyway um so I I think
 
03:13:59.950 --> 03:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
the question at hand is do you believe
 
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
this is the most appropriate uh way to
 
03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
need follow up thank you but given that
 
03:14:14.469 --> 03:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
on nobody is willing to raise a
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
tax on I think you ought to have a
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
conversation with your constituents
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
about what the property tax is doing to
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
them thank you I I'm well aware of uh
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
the the property taxes in my towns and I
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
think the the residents in those towns
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
would agree with you with with with me
 
03:14:35.910 --> 03:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe with you I don't want to read into
 
03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
what you were saying you you you talked
 
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
about the the fact that we're not
 
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
talking about raising taxes I I I
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
frankly think that those residents would
 
03:14:45.389 --> 03:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
not wish to see their property taxes or
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
any other taxes raised if if we can help
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
it we should be understanding that
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
people are having to tighten their belts
 
03:14:54.389 --> 03:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
at home uh that they have uh cost of
 
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
living which is increased uh
 
03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the last several years
 
03:15:00.030 --> 03:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
and we should be doing everything in our
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
power to cut
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
spending any other uh any other
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:15:11.910 --> 03:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.429 --> 03:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman to the
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is berie Dees I
 
03:15:27.750 --> 03:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
Association we are a nonpartisan
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit voluntary um membership
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
organization that each municipality and
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
city in the state of New Hampshire has
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
voluntarily uh joined and we represent
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
their interests here in the legislature
 
03:15:42.830 --> 03:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I am testifying today because the
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
municipal Association is a pose to House
 
03:15:48.269 --> 03:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 417 as currently written we are not
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the communications tax repeal
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
we have no stance on how the state
 
03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
raises its revenues or allocates those
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
revenues as long as it doesn't impact
 
03:15:58.189 --> 03:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
the aid that municipalities get but
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
where the revenue comes from we believe
 
03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
is completely in the purview of the
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
state we have no position on our only
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as it's
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
currently written is that um without an
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
update to RSA 72 8-a the
 
03:16:13.189 --> 03:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications polls and conduits
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
under our property tax statutes um the
 
03:16:16.560 --> 03:16:17.630 align:start position:0%
under our property tax statutes um the
current

03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
um telecoms companies that are subjected
 
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
their line subjected to the
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
communications tax they are exempt from
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
property tax we believe that if you are
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
to repeal the communications tax that
 
03:16:29.830 --> 03:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
you need to update the property tax
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
statute so they can be um a part of the
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
assessed property value in a community
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
like the electrical industry who's uh
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
subject to the utility properties tax so
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
we would kindly um our stance would be
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
to request the committee make an
 
03:16:44.910 --> 03:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill so then when the
 
03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
repeal is over that these uh that this
 
03:16:51.309 --> 03:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
real estate um would be treated the way
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
that the electrical industry is treated
 
03:16:55.229 --> 03:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
the utilities and um would be subjected
 
03:16:57.670 --> 03:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
to that tax um and there's also the
 
03:16:59.070 --> 03:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
issue that we kind of you know our
 
03:17:02.910 --> 03:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
assessors has raised with us which um is
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
it could be a constitutional unequal
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
protection argument because you'll have
 
03:17:08.349 --> 03:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
the electrical industry running lines
 
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
right next to the Telecommunications
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
industry and one is subjected to
 
03:17:13.790 --> 03:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes and the other one is
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
subjected to no tax and historically the
 
03:17:17.790 --> 03:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislature has argued that the
 
03:17:19.389 --> 03:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications line should not be
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
subjected to tax because there is a
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
Communications um Services tax so with
 
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
that I'll um I'll appreciate you guys
 
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I'll take any
 
03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
questions representa ORS thank you Mr
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
so do you have any idea I would hope you
 
03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
do how many properties are we talking
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
about what's the value of the properties
 
03:17:42.510 --> 03:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
and what would be the estimated Revenue
 
03:17:45.070 --> 03:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
to the state so this isn't necessarily
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
property it is the lines that are along
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
the telephone polls or the telephone
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
polls themselves I got that yep um you
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
would I I I would guess you'd have to
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
probably ask telecommunication lines
 
03:17:57.870 --> 03:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any specific
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
information from the municipality's end
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
of how much potential assessed property
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
value exists out there but you know I'd
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to Gander to say it's probably
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
around the same as how much there is
 
03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
electrical lines because most of these
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
telecommunication lines are right next
 
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
to the on the same telephone poll is
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
right next to the electrical lines for
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
the utility company
 
03:18:19.189 --> 03:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
so it's probably a lot of assessed value
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
yep follow up
 
03:18:24.429 --> 03:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
so the other side of that coin is the
 
03:18:27.189 --> 03:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
there are buildings and pieces of land
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
here and there like I see TDS has at
 
03:18:31.469 --> 03:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
least two or three in the Chai Chester
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
area so are those properties being
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
taxed that's a good question of what
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
property tax or if they're subjected to
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
adjust a telecommunications tax and I'll
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
take a note and I'll get back to you on
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
that yeah we like this is kind of out of
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
our wheelhouse but we do know that we'd
 
03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
like any assessed property in the
 
03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
community to be assessed equally with
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
other property and especially because
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
you would be able to burden shift from
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the property taxpayers to the
 
03:18:57.990 --> 03:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunications companies that
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
essentially wouldn't be paying a tax
 
03:19:02.429 --> 03:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
unless you made an update to RSA 72 call
 
03:19:04.910 --> 03:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
8-a yeah and I would be interested to
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
know if they're paying BBT or bet tax
 
03:19:10.990 --> 03:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
or I would guess they are but I'm not
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
100% sure you'd have to ask Dr but I
 
03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
would guess because they're a business
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be subjected to that
 
03:19:16.910 --> 03:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
tax and they makes that tax and they
 
03:19:18.910 --> 03:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
make enough Revenue but I will check to
 
03:19:21.309 --> 03:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
see um if they're subjected to you know
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
regular real estate
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
taxes representative opal excuse thank
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um and thank you for
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question I am sympathetic to
 
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
your argument um or
 
03:19:40.030 --> 03:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion my question though is my
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is there
 
03:19:43.710 --> 03:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
is excuse
 
03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
me federal law that bars taxation of
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
internet access and I'm
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
wondering we can't tax it under the
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
communications Services
 
03:19:57.790 --> 03:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
tax uh I think representative McFarland
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
talked about the complications there I'm
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
wondering what the what the federal law
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
versus if we change if we amend this to
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
allow Communications companies to be
 
03:20:14.189 --> 03:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
taxed by
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
property what impact that might have or
 
03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
how whether that would conflict with
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
federal law I'd have to defer to Dr I
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
mean they would be the ones that because
 
03:20:24.750 --> 03:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
I know there's specific statutes in the
 
03:20:27.309 --> 03:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax law that does
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
explain what is exempt so then it isn't
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
arai with federal law we don't have a
 
03:20:34.269 --> 03:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
stance on that currently um I haven't
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed those statutes closely follow
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair um no what I'm asking is Dr
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
already um says and I think
 
03:20:45.550 --> 03:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland talked about
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
this we do not
 
03:20:51.229 --> 03:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
tax um the communications tax is not a
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
tax on internet access it is only a tax
 
03:21:00.030 --> 03:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
essentially on landlines um uh so
 
03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
federal law bars taxing internet access
 
03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
the lines that you're talking about were
 
03:21:09.389 --> 03:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
this were were this bill to be amended
 
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
as apparently the municipal Association
 
03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
would like and again I'm sympathetic to
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
the argument but I'm wondering ing if
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the argument from the utility from the
 
03:21:22.510 --> 03:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
communications companies would be the
 
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
lines that you're prepared to Pro to to
 
03:21:28.990 --> 03:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
include as a property tax are lines that
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
provide not just phone service but also
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
internet access I mean for example in my
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
situation I have Xfinity whatever
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're calling themselves these days
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
that that provides both phone
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
service and my internet access but it's
 
03:21:49.229 --> 03:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
the same line and I don't know how I
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how you'd apply a property
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
tax to that I'm
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
just yeah I'm just wondering no that's
 
03:21:57.150 --> 03:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
an that's an excellent question um
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's the first time that's been raised
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
to me and I can bring that back to our
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
team at the municipal
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
Association um so I'll do some more
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
research and maybe I can send a letter
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee and provide some
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
clarification on how exactly maybe
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
exemption language need to be written in
 
03:22:11.790 --> 03:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
the federal statutes um we just know
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
that um it's been raised To Us by the
 
03:22:15.070 --> 03:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
assessors that there's a lot of assessed
 
03:22:17.790 --> 03:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
value in these land in these lines um
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the lines and the the
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
different telecommunication equipment
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that currently utilities um you know
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
electrical utilities are subjected to
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
the tax and it's been common for the
 
03:22:30.030 --> 03:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
exemption to exist and you know the
 
03:22:31.469 --> 03:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
justification for that exemption in our
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
property tax law has been the existence
 
03:22:35.950 --> 03:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
of um the CST the communication Services
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
tax so if that goes away we would like
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
that to come under um assess value in a
 
03:22:42.990 --> 03:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
community to tax so and I can try to
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
figure out more about it so we can make
 
03:22:45.790 --> 03:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
some clarities to make sure we're not
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
making recommend that run a foul with
 
03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
making recommend that run a foul with
federal

03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:22:53.229 --> 03:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
law representative Malloy thank you Mr
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
question this I think this follows up
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
with what we're just talking about would
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association be comfortable
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
then with uh an increase
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh property tax levy on the utilities
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the uh that would would the
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
municipal Association be in favor of
 
03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
that you said you weren't in favor of
 
03:23:18.189 --> 03:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the house bill as its r WR but if
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
if there was an increase burden on
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
business the the the utilities to pay
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
this tax would the municipal Association
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
be in favor of that well the utilities
 
03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
or you're talking about the util sorry
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
let me the property tax that they would
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
be paying if you had the bill change the
 
03:23:37.469 --> 03:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
way I think I understood what you wanted
 
03:23:41.070 --> 03:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about you maybe I didn't
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
understand it maybe you need to clarify
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah I so I can clarify um
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
currently tell Communications that are
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
subject to the communication Services
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax are Exempted from the utility's
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
property tax under um you know and it's
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
the specific exemption is the last
 
03:24:00.750 --> 03:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
sentence in RSA 72 8-a we believe if you
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
get rid of the communication Services
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
tax that like before the communication
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
Services tax existed that that those um
 
03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
telecommunication lines like utility Lin
 
03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
should be subed to the utility property
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
tax thank you my my misunderstanding
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
Thank you for clarifying appreciate it
 
03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
Thank you for clarifying appreciate it
represent

03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
elme thank
 
03:24:22.269 --> 03:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
you I think you ought to talk to the
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards
 
03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
Board on I believe they're the ones who
 
03:24:30.030 --> 03:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with this with the
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
telephone polls and have also been
 
03:24:36.070 --> 03:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
dealing in general with making
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
assessments Equitable
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
across and I think that they did finish
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the telephone polls so they
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
could give you an answer I appreciate
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
that and I was planning on we uh we
 
03:24:50.429 --> 03:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
contact a lot of our assessors and some
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
who do serve on that board to help with
 
03:24:54.429 --> 03:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
clarifications but they were also the
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
ones who raised this concern with us and
 
03:24:58.510 --> 03:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
also the Constitutional concern which is
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
not our primary concern we're more
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about the um the you know the
 
03:25:04.349 --> 03:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
potential loss of assess value in a
 
03:25:06.429 --> 03:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
community um that could decrease a tax
 
03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
burn under the property
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it sounds like a fair
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.309 --> 03:25:20.319 align:start position:0%

District
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
13 um I'm speaking in opposition to the
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
repeal of the communications tax
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
for a more General reason um I have had
 
03:26:01.670 --> 03:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
the honor of serving on the governor's
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
transition team and in a meeting
 
03:26:09.389 --> 03:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
yesterday with the LBA her legal counsel
 
03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
the chief of staff and the budget writer
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this repeal of the communication tax
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
was brought up in
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
conversation um that did not go well
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
they are extraordinarily concerned about
 
03:26:25.229 --> 03:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
the loss of revenue from this in order
 
03:26:28.750 --> 03:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
to create a state budget and I am as
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
well I I think when we're already
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
looking at shortfalls in revenue and
 
03:26:37.710 --> 03:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
projections that are are off if you will
 
03:26:41.309 --> 03:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
from our prior budget simply
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
repealing what amounts to almost $30
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
million seems doesn't seem like a good
 
03:26:50.309 --> 03:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
idea in these times so um so I I sit
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
before you in opposition to the repeal
 
03:26:54.189 --> 03:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
simply out of the sake of being able to
 
03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
create a a state budget that
 
03:27:00.189 --> 03:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
works thank you um do we have qu
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative elme yes uh we have
 
03:27:04.990 --> 03:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
already listened to a bill that was
 
03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
going to be cutting a tax again does
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
this cover blanketly or just no I'm
 
03:27:15.150 --> 03:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically to this to the
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
and this is one that would actually help
 
03:27:25.229 --> 03:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
the towns to make up losses that they've
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
been given from the state I mean how how
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
that money is used and how that goes
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
into the state budget is is currently
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
the purview of the governor's office I
 
03:27:36.550 --> 03:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to speak to how they want
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
to do that but you know like I said when
 
03:27:41.550 --> 03:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at when we're looking at
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
shortfalls here I I just don't think
 
03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
this is the time to do away with a
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.150 --> 03:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
Source represent
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
Opel um representative McFarland
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
testified and
 
03:27:59.710 --> 03:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
I'm um I don't have the statistics in
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
front of me but just recognizing the
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
landlines are going the way of telegraph
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
polls and Pony
 
03:28:11.790 --> 03:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
Express um and you just referred to this
 
03:28:14.469 --> 03:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
as a consistent source of Revenue I'm
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
are you really sure of that it seems
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
like yeah the numbers have been fairly
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
consistent over the years it is
 
03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
regressing it is shrinking but it's it's
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
not falling off a cliff so we we still
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
have use of this Revenue source for now
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
I mean we're looking at a two-year
 
03:28:31.710 --> 03:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
budget it's a it's a two-year
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
projection I I understand we're looking
 
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
at a two-year projection but you would
 
03:28:38.469 --> 03:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
agree that the numbers have declined
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
over time sure thank
 
03:28:45.070 --> 03:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
you yes represent yeah thank you you
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
understand there's concern about the
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
repeal of the tax at this time is there
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
a concern about a repeal at this tax at
 
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
a later time or a phase in
 
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
repeal like I said I I've we exist in
 
03:28:58.510 --> 03:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
twoyear Cycles so I'm I have to look at
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
the now which is which is
 
03:29:04.349 --> 03:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
today and and that now includes the
 
03:29:05.790 --> 03:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
entire cycle of the budget so even
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
though this might be phased in over two
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
years uh the position is that you prefer
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
not to be addressed at all during this
 
03:29:13.590 --> 03:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
two-year period correct I would prefer
 
03:29:15.150 --> 03:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
that the communications tax stay exactly
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%

03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
do that and like I said the discussion
 
03:29:46.269 --> 03:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
was solely around the communic the
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%

HB

03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
4177 seeing none I will close the public
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:34.269 --> 03:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
417 and we now
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
have 15 minutes until the next uh public
 
03:30:43.189 --> 03:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
1:45 yes May
 
03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:49.189 align:start position:0%
1:45 yes May
um

03:30:49.189 --> 03:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:49.199 --> 03:30:51.070 align:start position:0%
um
speaker

03:30:51.070 --> 03:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead um is there a protocol for
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
when we look at the
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
signin is my question because some
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
committees actually say how many signed
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
in which way but now that you can sign
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
in all day my suggestion would be when
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
we do the exec maybe somehow the clerk
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
or someone would say say on this bill 80
 
03:31:20.469 --> 03:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
signed in for 20 against so cuz I think
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to record
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
that um I mean some committees used to
 
03:31:26.670 --> 03:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually hold up the pink sheets well
 
03:31:29.070 --> 03:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
not the pink sheet the the blue yeah the
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah the blue sheet yeah and and you're
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
exactly right the issue is that now they
 
03:31:34.630 --> 03:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
can sign in all day us to you had to
 
03:31:36.910 --> 03:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
sign in but maybe if we do it around the
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
time that we exec at least it's part of
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the record that we know how the signin
 
03:31:43.309 --> 03:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
went yeah is that something you can get
 
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
Bill and I think your clerk would be
 
03:31:47.229 --> 03:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
great at doing that talk to Karen about
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
I know they have to fill up sheets
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
somebody has to keep that normally that
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
would put into the file yeah they keep
 
03:31:54.750 --> 03:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
it in the folder yeah up to the chair
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether we announced that or not okay
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
good practice I didn't know if there was
 
03:31:58.239 --> 03:31:59.429 align:start position:0%
good practice I didn't know if there was
a

03:31:59.429 --> 03:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
protocol it seems fair to the public
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but you guys I'm sure you can work
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
out a system but I mean some committees
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
really make a big deal about reading the
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah we'll see what we can
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
I don't check it off till the first
 
03:32:34.239 --> 03:32:37.790 align:start position:0%
I don't check it off till the first
speaker

03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
goes so I want a free appertizer that's
 
03:32:43.229 --> 03:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
why it was late did you get one yeah we
 
03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
got um the arti choke dip yep those good
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.030 --> 03:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
Rich understand some of the the chairs
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
that well um they don't pay anything
 
03:33:05.469 --> 03:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
people people don't pay any attention to
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
it I mean I've heard people say oh
 
03:33:08.670 --> 03:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
they're out of state
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
or so they don't care especially on
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
things like um Universal
 
03:33:17.229 --> 03:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
vouchers I mean it like thousands to you
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:44.720 --> 03:34:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%

I'll open in the public hearing on HB

03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone uh thank you for
 
03:47:51.070 --> 03:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
your time today uh here today to
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
03:47:57.870 --> 03:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
596 um and if if you were a
 
03:48:00.030 --> 03:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative from the North
 
03:48:03.269 --> 03:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
country or really any tourism driven
 
03:48:05.149 --> 03:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
area in the state of New
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you've likely had a
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
constituent approach you and ask what
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
seems like a really innocent question
 
03:48:16.590 --> 03:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
which is how much meals and rooms
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
revenue is collected in our
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
town that seems like it should be a
 
03:48:23.229 --> 03:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
pretty simple
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
question what happens next is a journey
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
down a rabbit
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
hole searching for this data which
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
you'll eventually learn quite simply
 
03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:36.149 align:start position:0%
you'll eventually learn quite simply
doesn't

03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
exist and why is
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
that so our current meals and rooms
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
reporting practices do not require
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
operators to report the municipality
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
where receipts were
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
collected the data simply doesn't
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
exist and additionally we allow
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
operators with facilities in multiple
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to consolidate receipts
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
under a single Master license
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
attributing all their revenues received
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
to a single
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
County so receipts collected in one
 
03:49:12.189 --> 03:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
County are frequently reported in
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
another leaving the public with no reli
 
03:49:18.750 --> 03:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
ible way to understand where the revenue
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
originates and in other words we have an
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
incomplete picture of where the revenue
 
03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:26.590 align:start position:0%
incomplete picture of where the revenue
comes

03:49:26.590 --> 03:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
comes
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
from and those reports which are made
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
available actually share misleading data
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
attributing this Revenue received in one
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
County to
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
another if you're like me who comes from
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
a management background in the private
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
sector this is a really surprising
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
discovery you know imagine running your
 
03:49:51.630 --> 03:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
business and not knowing where your
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue comes from how do you plan how
 
03:49:56.189 --> 03:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
do you invest how do you allocate
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
resources effectively and this is the
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
same untenable situation that we face in
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and HB 596
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
seeks to remedy
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
that so at its core this bill this bill
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
intends to uphold the principles of
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
government transparency and
 
03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
accountability by ensuring that meals
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax revenues are tracked and
 
03:50:24.910 --> 03:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
reported at the municipal
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
level in my opinion transparency
 
03:50:31.189 --> 03:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be a bureaucratic
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
ideal but we should look at it as a
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of public
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
Trust And while I am far from the first
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative to tell a shocked constit
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
consent asking about this question that
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire will not make
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
this data available to them I hope to be
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
the last it just seems like this is a
 
03:50:58.269 --> 03:50:58.279 align:start position:0%
question we should be able to answer for
 
03:50:58.279 --> 03:50:59.950 align:start position:0%
question we should be able to answer for
our

03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
constituents taxpayers have a right to
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
know how and where their money is
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
generated and used and just as a
 
03:51:10.189 --> 03:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
business owner relies on accurate
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue data to make informed decisions
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
our state our towns and our local
 
03:51:19.389 --> 03:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
tourism organizations need precise
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
information to measure the impact of
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
effectively the granular reporting that
 
03:51:30.189 --> 03:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow will help us to
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
paint that clearer picture of which
 
03:51:36.510 --> 03:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
communities are driving tourism related
 
03:51:39.229 --> 03:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
income additionally this level of
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
specificity will make it easier to
 
03:51:43.870 --> 03:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
identify emerging Trends and adapt
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
quickly to grow grow opportunities
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring a more targeted and impactful
 
03:51:51.630 --> 03:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
approach to strengthening our local
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
economies among those who will benefit
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the longitudinal data set this
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
reporting would create are our towns
 
03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
themselves our tourism related
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and even our state division
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
of travel and tourism this is data that
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
will be valuable to
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
all so how do we achieve these goals
 
03:52:17.790 --> 03:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
this bill makes two targeted changes to
 
03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:18.710 align:start position:0%
this bill makes two targeted changes to
current

03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
statute first it requires the Dr to
 
03:52:23.149 --> 03:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
update its reporting forms so that
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
operators include the municipality where
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
receipts were collected in addition to
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
the total revenues and we could still do
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
this on a Consolidated
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
form second to address privacy concerns
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
in smaller communities with very few
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
operators which I take seriously the
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill includes a narrow exemption to
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
confidential rules the Dr the Dr will
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
disclose Municipal Revenue data only for
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
communities with 10 or more operators
 
03:52:56.670 --> 03:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
ensuring taxpayer privacy while still
 
03:52:58.950 --> 03:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
providing accurate and useful data
 
03:52:58.960 --> 03:53:00.990 align:start position:0%
providing accurate and useful data
wherever

03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
possible by requiring the Dr to collect
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
and disclose aggregated tax data by
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
municipality while protecting taxpayer
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
privacy in smaller communities this bill
 
03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
balances the need for public access to
 
03:53:18.030 --> 03:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
data with reasonable confidentiality
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
protections it's my goal that HB 596
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
would Empower towns tourism
 
03:53:25.710 --> 03:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
organizations and the state's division
 
03:53:28.590 --> 03:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
of travel and tourism to make datadriven
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
decisions that strengthen infrastructure
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
attract visitors and boost local
 
03:53:37.149 --> 03:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
economies all while giving our
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
constituents confidence in how revenues
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
are managed and I'm happy to take your
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions I'm I'm also um happy to turn
 
03:53:49.229 --> 03:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
it over anytime to my colleague rep
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
Tierney who we have a a large number of
 
03:53:54.269 --> 03:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
co-signers uh on a letter on this bill
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking forward to him
 
03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
sharing R ORS thank you Mr chairman
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so is
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
there a problem in your opinion with the
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
revenue being collected and not being
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
reported being withheld by a business or
 
03:54:16.030 --> 03:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
is this beyond that
 
03:54:17.550 --> 03:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question I'm not
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
quite sure I understand yeah I I wasn't
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
quite sure if there's a a reporting
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that's not you know business
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
are collecting the taxes but not re not
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
retaining them and giving them to the
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
state they're so I I wasn't sure if it
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
was that and or
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
more that's not that's not my goal that
 
03:54:38.149 --> 03:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
may be something this committee may be
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
concerned with but it's not what this
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill deals with this bill is strictly
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
about ensuring that when these revenues
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
are reported that we understand where
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
they were collected which is currently
 
03:54:52.750 --> 03:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
simply not the case um we both don't
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
know the municipality where they were
 
03:54:56.149 --> 03:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
collected but we also often have
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect data about the county in which
 
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
they were corrected you can be you can
 
03:55:03.149 --> 03:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
be an operator with 10 facilities across
 
03:55:05.229 --> 03:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
the state you could have nine of those
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
facilities in Coos but report them all
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
out of Grafton right so we the the data
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
we get is very misleading and the data
 
03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the public receives and is relying
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
Opel um I understand this is not the
 
03:55:31.149 --> 03:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but I'm wondering
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
what assurances you might give
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
particularly smaller
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
communities um while I certainly would
 
03:55:41.229 --> 03:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
agree that it's good management to
 
03:55:43.389 --> 03:55:43.399 align:start position:0%
understand where your revenue is coming
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
from and where your expenditures are no
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
matter where it
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
is um could this not be a first step
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
toward some communi saying hey we're
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
doing twice the amount of rooms and
 
03:56:01.870 --> 03:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
meals tax as our neighbor we should be
 
03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
getting a larger share back and thus
 
03:56:07.830 --> 03:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
punishing communities who may not have
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
the natural resources the mountains or
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
the ocean or whatever um and and wind up
 
03:56:15.630 --> 03:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we're pitting
 
03:56:18.990 --> 03:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
neighbor against neighbor sure I guess
 
03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
my answer to that
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
is this is a little bit of a copout but
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's a question for another day um I
 
03:56:28.590 --> 03:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
think the the question on my mind is
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
should the data be available do does the
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
public and do those towns people
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of what they feel once they
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
have the data deserve to have access to
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
that information I will say coming from
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
a rural tourist Community I certainly am
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
going to advocate for for additional
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue solutions for my town but what I
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
see as the revenue solution may be
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
different than what my co-sponsor
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Ros for sees or what another
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
person sees is the appropriate solution
 
03:56:57.870 --> 03:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
so I would say we need the data and I
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
hope that we can agree that that we need
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
the data and the public deserves the
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
data and then we all do need to come
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
back for a separate conversation about
 
03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
how do we ensure that small towns have
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
the resources they need and the revenues
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
they need but I'm not advocating here
 
03:57:19.790 --> 03:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
Tierney good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:57:40.800 --> 03:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
Tierney good afternoon Mr chairman and
uh

03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives okay I'm not a
 
03:57:46.349 --> 03:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill but I've been
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
asked by the Coos delegation to read a
 
03:57:53.550 --> 03:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
letter uh that they have all jointly
 
03:57:56.189 --> 03:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
signed uh dear committee chair and
 
03:57:58.149 --> 03:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
members the letter requests the
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
committee to support HB 596 relative to
 
03:58:04.149 --> 03:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for entities that
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
collect meals and rooms
 
03:58:08.550 --> 03:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
taxes uh change the next couple of words
 
03:58:10.990 --> 03:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
to say the Coos County delegation
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
unanimously supports this bill our
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
district Senator Dave roachford is a
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill given the
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
substantial impact turm has on our
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
region and it is substantial it is
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
essential to consider the benefits of
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
identifying these taxes at the municipal
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
level as opposed to countywide our
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
Region's tourism sector is vibrant and
 
03:58:33.790 --> 03:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
healthy and highly concentrated in
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
specific municipalities each
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
contributing differently to the overall
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
tourism landscape by quantifying meals
 
03:58:42.750 --> 03:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
and room taxes at the municipal level we
 
03:58:44.670 --> 03:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
can achieve more accurate meaningful
 
03:58:47.590 --> 03:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
data on where tourism res revenues are
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
being generated and how budgetary
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
decisions can best support these
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
impacted communities below are several
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
important benefits of quantifying these
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
taxes on a municipal scale accurate
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue attribution quantifying meals
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
and rooms taxes at the municipal level
 
03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
allows for a more precise allocation of
 
03:59:07.469 --> 03:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
tax revenue directly correlating it with
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
the specific localities that generate it
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
this enables municipalities to track
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
exactly how much tourism Revenue they
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
are producing as opposed to relying on
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%

and

accountability regarding the fiscal note
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
we would like to formally note that the
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
$50,000 fiscal impact for each for such
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
an improvement appears rather excessive
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
considering the minor technical change
 
04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
required in the system even if the cost
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
is near this amount the return on
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
investment for 13 cities and 221 towns
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
would amount to just
 
04:01:31.830 --> 04:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
$214 per Community which seems like an
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
excellent value in conclusion the
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
ability to qualify to quantify meals and
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
rooms taxes at the municipal level
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
provides local governments with the
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
tools to make more informed data-driven
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
decisions it ensures that the revenue
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
generated from tourism is tracked
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
accurately and used efficiently
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately benefiting the local economy
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%

04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
provided by both residents and visitors
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your consideration of
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
the matter I would be happy to further
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
discuss the potential benefits of
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
quantifying Tourism related taxes at the
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipal level and how this approach
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
could positively impact our region and
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
it's signed by rep Davis which is uh

seven and with that thank you you want I
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
will take any questions if you've got
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
them got a lot of good ones for
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
you I think does does anyone have any
 
04:02:48.950 --> 04:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions actually since no one has any
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
question I do have one question that was
 
04:02:54.510 --> 04:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
swirling around my mind is I'm listening
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
to all this testimony and that
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
is the whole point is to get data for
 
04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh cities you know
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
whatever on an individualized basis but
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't each municipality know they know
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
how many restaurants they have in town
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
they know how many uh hotels they have
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
in town uh planning boards planning
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
board members typically have a really
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
good feel for how things are going um it
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that individual towns
 
04:03:28.510 --> 04:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
because I know one of the concerns was
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
if a town has 10 or fewer establishments
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
then um you know they would be exempt
 
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
from this
 
04:03:39.389 --> 04:03:39.399 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's not like
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
I mean in my mind I'm just think just
 
04:03:43.389 --> 04:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
thinking as I'm talking that it would
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
seem like each municipality or city they
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
know exactly what they've got in their
 
04:03:52.149 --> 04:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and um they can make
 
04:03:55.389 --> 04:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
decisions based on how much traffic they
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
have going to these
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
establishments correct they can but the
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
problem they've got is uh my town for
 
04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
example we don't have 10 entities we'd
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
be we wouldn't get the
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
information um but uh other ones do and
 
04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
their question question is it goes back
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
to what I call the nonsense that was
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
created with swept donor
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
towns any tax you can think of income
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
sales doesn't make any difference swept
 
04:04:30.269 --> 04:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
there's a donor in every single one of
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
them be it a wealthy community sends
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
more income tax in or a community that's
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
got a whole bunch of stores there's
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
contributing more sales
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
tax other ones don't contribute as much
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
so everything has a donor Town we're not
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking to find out who's a donor Town
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for is to find out
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
how much that town is bringing into the
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
area in regards to how much they're also
 
04:04:58.349 --> 04:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
getting back then maybe they yeah they'd
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
ask for it or do we throw more money
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
into that because this was asked for by
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
our uh economic uh development adviser
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
for the county she's the one who uh
 
04:05:12.510 --> 04:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
requested the bill be put in and she's
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
the one who G up this letter that the
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
nine of us signed she's looking for the
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
information to find out where do we
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
concentrate our uh monies that we're
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
investing in the uh County or in the
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities where do they go which
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
one are we getting the better uh bang
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
buck that's what she's looking for okay
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh represent
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
ol the way I understand it each
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
Community receives a check or transfer
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
for funds yep correct
 
04:05:47.560 --> 04:05:49.550 align:start position:0%
for funds yep correct
um

04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
routinely they have a record going back
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
years as to how much they make they know
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
that if a
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
new um restaurant opens
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
up then there should be an increase and
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
if there isn't then somebody's
 
04:06:09.550 --> 04:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant failed and somebody's
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
didn't by the way don't go into the
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant business a lot of them fail
 
04:06:14.880 --> 04:06:17.790 align:start position:0%
restaurant business a lot of them fail
yes

04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
but the information is there if you look
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
for it you've got a history of how much
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
is coming in and it's not just how much
 
04:06:33.070 --> 04:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
is coming in from the town or to the or
 
04:06:36.269 --> 04:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
from the town and then going back to the
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
town but it also has to deal with what
 
04:06:42.990 --> 04:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
the overall economic environment is so
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
having to specify this out to me and I
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
sit on the planning board in my
 
04:06:50.960 --> 04:06:53.429 align:start position:0%
sit on the planning board in my
town

04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
unimportant because you have to deal
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
with the entire operation not just how
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
much is coming in from the
 
04:07:01.319 --> 04:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
much is coming in from the
MWR

04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
MWR
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
it it's it's
 
04:07:10.830 --> 04:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
just unimportant data is that because
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to say it's one we were
 
04:07:14.110 --> 04:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
told not to ask
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
believe it it may be unimportant to the
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
planning board side of the house or but
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
to the economic development side of the
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
house um they seem to want the
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
information and all we're attempting
 
04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
with this is to get it for them when we
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
get meals and rooms taxes and I'm on the
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
select board in Northland okay we get a
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
single check and if I remember correctly
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
it comes once a year towards the end of
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
the year it's not I don't think it's a
 
04:07:43.239 --> 04:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
the year it's not I don't think it's a
month

04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
transfer and uh so we get our
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
check um how much of that came from
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
the I think it's three hotels we've got
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
in town
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
motels uh versus uh how many for the
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
four or five restaurants that we've got
 
04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
in town uh nobody knows which restaurant
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
is doing well which restaurant is doing
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
bad okay uh with the size of Northland
 
04:08:12.750 --> 04:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
you can tell by how many cars are in the
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
parking lot you usually but is that
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
because the cook is not up to standards
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
or do they have the wrong type of uh
 
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
Cuisine that they're offering in other
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
words are they tie and nobody up in that
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
neck of the wood say wants it don't know
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh and that information isn't going to
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be in there well it would be
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
in there because we'd be getting it by
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh restaurant so this one's failing for
 
04:08:39.149 --> 04:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
this reason that one's failing for that
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
reason it just gives the economic
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
development folks the ability to figure
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
out what way to look at it do we need
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
more fried chicken places versus do we
 
04:08:52.750 --> 04:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
need uh more Korean
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
ones follow
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
up is it the job of the community to go
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
out and select and pick and choose what
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
they need or just say here we are if you
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
want to come here come here if you don't
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's your choice but is it the job of
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the community to go out and pick and
 
04:09:16.349 --> 04:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
choose what restaurant they want to have
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
in town or what motel chain they want to
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
town not the community but the economic
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
development yes because if they can tell
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
you that this restaurant or that type
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
hotel is going to do better wouldn't you
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
rather invest and put that one up than
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
04:09:42.030 --> 04:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
Bolton would you believe that I agree
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
with both representative and our chair
 
04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
and um I just have a question like maybe
 
04:09:49.630 --> 04:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
the the one benefit that might come out
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
of this probably can't because I
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
understand that um if it's a um provider
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
that has multiple facilities in
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
different towns they might have an
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
aggregate um you know transmission other
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know M&amp;R to uh excuse me Dr but um
 
04:10:09.389 --> 04:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative we we can't excuse me
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't hear you I'm sorry okay
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
which part did you miss me agreeing with
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
chair so um I I just think the one thing
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I might conceive of as a value as
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
being um a select board member in town
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
of Plymouth is um more granular
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
reporting but apparently that's that
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
can't happen or doesn't happen you know
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have um you know Alex Ray uh has two
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
facilities in Plymouth and a hotel but
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
he ALS I don't know how he Aggregates
 
04:10:45.109 --> 04:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
his uh revenues um of all the things he
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
has but that might be of value and I'm
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
not certain if uh if this can be met um
 
04:10:54.030 --> 04:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're aware of that or
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
maybe Dr could let us know no I know it
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
it took uh uh the folks up at the County
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh about a week to finally get reports
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
out of Dr that just told them okay
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
here's how much meals tax you got and
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
here's how much rooms tax you got
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
but not what communities it came from
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
just how much the county got uh and or
 
04:11:23.109 --> 04:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
actually how much the county collected
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
and paid in uh from it what ones came
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
from there they'd like it broken out by
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
municipality to assist them and my
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
daughter works for the common man and I
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
believe they've got 10 or 12 restaurants
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
here in the state spread all over the
 
04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
place so where he puts them out from I
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't know either follow follow up so
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
why couldn't it be maybe it's a question
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
for Dr obviously but why couldn't it be
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
broken up into um you know more granular
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
level uh not countywide but maybe
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
townwide I have a sneaking suspicion
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
from the bill and in talking with some
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the others that the reason for this
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
is Dr won't do it unless they're told to
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.109 --> 04:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
it representative Southworth uh thank
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
question which is kind of broad um I
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
should have this memorized I think I do
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
but my understanding was that the meals
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax is collected again with
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
these problems you've mentioned but it's
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
given out per capita it really has
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do if you have if you have no
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants in your town you get you
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
know meals and rooms and if you have the
 
04:12:39.389 --> 04:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
most restaurants in the whole Sea Coast
 
04:12:42.030 --> 04:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
you don't get so so some of what we've
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
said got a little bit off I think
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
because it has nothing to do with what
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
you have in your town to get meals and
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
rooms money and someone's talking about
 
04:12:51.550 --> 04:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
the select when people can look at how
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
much you get each year you can and you
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
can see if it went up or down from the
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
State but has nothing to do with your
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
businesses at all um so I think your
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill is very important um I think that
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be useful data for lots of things
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
in fact here on this committee we've
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
been interested in this data for 10
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
years that I've been here but anyway
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
04:13:20.590 --> 04:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question to get
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
even more specific about this and Dr is
 
04:13:25.710 --> 04:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
here if I recall this committee has been
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
told that by getting very granular with
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
this in terms of knowing what restaurant
 
04:13:33.790 --> 04:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
is doing what and their sales here their
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
hotel sales there would provide
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
competitive information to uh uh their
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
competitors and then people would find
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
out just exactly how much of a
 
04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant is making how much he's
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
losing so on and so forth so that's been
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
from what I've recalled that's been a a
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
position that the Dr has explained to us
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of confidentiality and
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and tax collection Dr is here
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
and perhaps they can address that again
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
but that's my would you believe that's
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding I'm sorry sorry thank
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
you sorry well like I said our town
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even get it the information
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
simply because we don't have enough of
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
10 May I follow up well my my question
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
Still Remains would you believe that if
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
this was released there would be
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
competitive information wherever you are
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
in in Portsmouth or Keen or conquered
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates to the competitors
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
what your particular restaurant or hotel
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
is making and that would be a
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to the owner that might be
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage and and if that were the
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
case then I could see where um this
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
could become
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh not subject to a
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
91a so that the town wouldn't have to
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
give the information out to anybody but
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
the one who came in and asked about
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
their particular restaurant and they
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
should know the information themselves
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
anyway but it would not be subject to a
 
04:15:07.640 --> 04:15:11.950 align:start position:0%
anyway but it would not be subject to a
91a

04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
request so it would simply
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
stay with the board of Selectmen a town
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
manager Town Administrator whatever and
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
around okay representative ducet yeah
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman to to
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
accentuate the point at least the way I
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
I read this it's talking about reporting
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
from the municipality not from
 
04:15:42.990 --> 04:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
Individual businesses yeah individual
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
Enders so I can see in a smaller
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation where it was
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
11 uh people that paid into you might be
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
able to do that but I I don't know that
 
04:15:55.870 --> 04:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
that argument holds water in at least
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
legislation okay thank thank you next up
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:16:19.640 --> 04:16:21.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
duet

04:16:21.630 --> 04:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
duet
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
on I would ask to talk about the
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
confidentiality part of this first uh
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's the only thing that anybody but the
 
04:16:36.750 --> 04:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
Dr would see would be aggregations of
 
04:16:36.760 --> 04:16:38.510 align:start position:0%
Dr would see would be aggregations of
the

04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:38.520 --> 04:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
the
the

04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
from uh over
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
10 from 10 or more uh uh restaurants or
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
hotels and hotels so it would not
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
provide it might provide somebody who
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
was creating a chain from
 
04:17:08.269 --> 04:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh to decide that gee I want to
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
go put one in Lebanon and I want to go
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
put one in in uh
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
sale them but uh because they seem to be
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
doing quite a lot of
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
business um but it would not provide
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
enough information for any kind of
 
04:17:27.630 --> 04:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage otherwise that I
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
can think of um what I wanted to do was
 
04:17:35.309 --> 04:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
expand this a little bit because it is
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
not just
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
tourism it is as some people were saying
 
04:17:40.399 --> 04:17:41.590 align:start position:0%
tourism it is as some people were saying
Economic

04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
Economic
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
Development and how how you chart the
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
different towns chart their courses
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
depending on what
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
um what resources they've got relative
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
to other places but
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
also uh a question of fairness that the
 
04:18:01.800 --> 04:18:02.990 align:start position:0%
also uh a question of fairness that the
in

04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:18:06.429 --> 04:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
the the restaurant and hotel business is
 
04:18:06.439 --> 04:18:07.590 align:start position:0%
the the restaurant and hotel business is
spread

04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
spread
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
out uh highly unequally around the state
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it concentrates in the
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
largest uh population areas but it also
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
concentrates in the middle-sized towns
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
that are hubs for a very large area
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
Lebanon is a
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
metropolis uh uh what do you call
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
micropolis of a 100,000
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
people of whom at this point we're
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly growing 16,000 and uh live in
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and sleep there but everybody
 
04:18:53.429 --> 04:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
else about I think probably half of them
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
come in Daily to
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
work um they stay afterwards they get
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
drunk they run into each other's
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
cars uh they they start fires they screw
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
up the plumbing they do all sorts of
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
things that the town then has to deal
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
with with um and and then they go home
 
04:19:21.790 --> 04:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
and they have a child that has mental
 
04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
health issues child comes to Lebanon
 
04:19:26.670 --> 04:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:19:29.309 --> 04:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh homeless people that can't figure out
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
what to do they come to
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
and on they they so they're the also the
 
04:19:42.429 --> 04:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
hub for a lot of Social Services which
 
04:19:45.550 --> 04:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
and representative Bolton can tell you
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh are usually tax exempt uh from
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
property tax for good reason
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
um we have the largest uh Regional
 
04:20:02.429 --> 04:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
thrift store in our region uh and huge
 
04:20:04.750 --> 04:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
numbers of people are coming to it now
 
04:20:07.229 --> 04:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
and and the money from that thrift store
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
goes to helping all of those people that
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
are looking for for monit AR
 
04:20:18.910 --> 04:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
Assistance or or assistance with how to
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
turn their lives around which is given
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
without money except for the salaries so
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
hubs get per population just like
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
everybody else but the hubs have a lot
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
more costs than anybody
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
else and for us to turn around and try
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
to ruce ourselves to having a police
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
department the size per capita that
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
everybody else in our sector of Grafton
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
County does um would create a major
 
04:20:58.439 --> 04:21:00.269 align:start position:0%
County does um would create a major
crime

04:21:00.269 --> 04:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
crime
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
wave because we need three times that in
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
order to keep up with all of the
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
accidents that happened and people that
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
fight with each other and people that
 
04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
are caught with methane lab methadone
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
labs things like that
 
04:21:15.199 --> 04:21:17.149 align:start position:0%
labs things like that
uh

04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:21.389 --> 04:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
and on this is not just lean and
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a lot of smaller Urban
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
hubs around the state that are
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
struggling to deal with the fact that
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
becomes considerably inequitable and one
 
04:21:39.070 --> 04:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
of the things that it is in involved
 
04:21:40.349 --> 04:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
is um that the meals and rooms tax which
 
04:21:49.149 --> 04:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
is found primarily in those those hubs
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
and in the large
 
04:21:50.960 --> 04:21:52.670 align:start position:0%
and in the large
cities

04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
cities
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
um is um distributed per capita so I
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
know this this is an issue that probably
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
we lose because we um there are an aw I
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
think probably more people in the
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislature that are from small small
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
towns and our bedroom
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
communities uh or or um retirement
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
communities than there are working
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
communities but we have two of the
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
largest companies in the world based in
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and we have a lot of other
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that grow up in Lebanon and
 
04:22:40.510 --> 04:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
stay in Lebanon and we need more help
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
with economic development so that we can
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
afford to keep these going without
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
having a major tax
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
revote and I think that it would help to
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
know that I I forget I have no idea how
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
many we've got it now now I think it's
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
about 20 25 restaurants inside lean and
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
but it's probably it may be 40 uh plus
 
04:23:07.199 --> 04:23:08.229 align:start position:0%
but it's probably it may be 40 uh plus
food

04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
food
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
trucks so I don't know how you address a
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
but I think that the issue is really
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
important and that the reporting is
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
really the first step towards trying to
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
figure out how you make this work
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
was will you take questions
 
04:23:34.119 --> 04:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
was will you take questions
representative

04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
YY thank you representative for taking
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
my question or questions I have two the
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
first question is where in this bill is
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
there anything about confidentiality of
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
the of the aggregated funds information
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
so that it it doesn't become part of the
 
04:23:54.199 --> 04:23:55.229 align:start position:0%
so that it it doesn't become part of the
public

04:23:55.229 --> 04:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
record in the town so that the anybody
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
can come up and start taking a look at
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
their various uh uh restaurant or uh
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
Motel businesses to see what's going on
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
I thought I remembered seeing this in
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
second I do know that this is a strict
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like it isn't in there but I do
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
know that this is a strict uh rule of
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they shall not release the Nam the
 
04:24:41.109 --> 04:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
numbers of anything that is less than
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
10 I yes we both know that uh and I
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
would just wanted to point that out that
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's not here oh specific question uh
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
the other question I have is it seems as
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
though this bill is putting a burden on
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
the various taxpayers to come up with
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
another set of forms another set of
 
04:25:01.000 --> 04:25:02.070 align:start position:0%
another set of forms another set of
accounting

04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
another is that cost taken into
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
consideration a cost of the
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
business is that taken into
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
consideration I don't believe it is I
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
believe it' be a little a little bit of
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty to set up uh I'd like to uh
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
mention that representative of
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
brami uh lives in a town which has no
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant or at least it did when he
 
04:25:30.510 --> 04:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
was telling us this and they had uh on
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
the books they had nine restaurants in
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
that town because uh the owner of those
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
nine restaurants lived in that town
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah some of those are big chains and on
 
04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
the main road there um yeah I thank you
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
thanks anybody else yes represent
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Amy I expressed my
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
concern before to you personally but
 
04:26:09.149 --> 04:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
um and Mr chairman give me just a little
 
04:26:10.590 --> 04:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
bit of leeway I'm going to talk about
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.469 --> 04:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
sitting here for the last few weeks
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
listening to all of the
 
04:26:23.830 --> 04:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh representing three small
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
towns um in a school district that is
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
struggling um in a state
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
where the quality of your education
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
depends very much on your ZIP
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
code which is kind of arbitrary and not
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
really relative to whether you deserve a
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
quality education and
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
now my fear
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that we're going in the same
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
direction potentially or at least we're
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
opening the
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
door um to begin to reward those
 
04:26:58.830 --> 04:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
communities that have been blessed
 
04:26:58.840 --> 04:27:00.670 align:start position:0%
communities that have been blessed
with

04:27:00.670 --> 04:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunities for tourism and
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
great natural
 
04:27:10.109 --> 04:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
beauty and communities that maybe aren't
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
quite so
 
04:27:15.630 --> 04:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
blessed potentially will be again short
 
04:27:15.640 --> 04:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
blessed potentially will be again short
short

04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%

04:27:16.640 --> 04:27:17.630 align:start position:0%

04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%

04:27:17.640 --> 04:27:18.750 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:21.109 --> 04:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether there's
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
something you can offer or the other
 
04:27:26.910 --> 04:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this can offer that would
 
04:27:26.920 --> 04:27:28.349 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this can offer that would
reassure

04:27:28.349 --> 04:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
reassure
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
me but I'll also say I sit on my Town's
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
planning board and I chair our economic
 
04:27:35.279 --> 04:27:37.309 align:start position:0%
planning board and I chair our economic
development

04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I would ask you would you
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
believe that I have a very good sense of
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
which of the four restaurants in our
 
04:27:49.309 --> 04:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
town are doing well and which are not
 
04:27:49.319 --> 04:27:51.070 align:start position:0%
town are doing well and which are not
and

04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
why so I I'm sorry Mr chairman I think I
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
asked two questions there well I
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually it was interesting what you
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
just said because that was part of my
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
premise when I was talking earlier that
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
planning boards and and certainly
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
Economic Development boards within towns
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
know what's going on so I'm I'm I'm
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
still not sure I completely understand
 
04:28:11.279 --> 04:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
still not sure I completely understand
the

04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
the need for this yeah I will say as a
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative from a hub Urban Hub
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is at this point growing beyond
 
04:28:25.920 --> 04:28:27.309 align:start position:0%
which is at this point growing beyond
our

04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
capacity and is been sparking tax
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
revolts that we hadn't seen for a long
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
time um it is on we we cannot control
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
what is going on
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
in representative opal's town or in St
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury where some of our people that
 
04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
work daily in our place come from in
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont on but we are the
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
recipient of influxes of people that
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
work in our area that that eat in our
 
04:29:15.870 --> 04:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
area area that
 
04:29:15.880 --> 04:29:17.790 align:start position:0%
area area that
on

04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:29:21.790 --> 04:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
on get snowbound sometimes in our area
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
um that come for the hospital which is
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
the major Hospital in in Northern New
 
04:29:31.830 --> 04:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
England and
 
04:29:35.149 --> 04:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
come for
 
04:29:39.750 --> 04:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
um come to deal drugs in in our
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
malls and I occasionally come to write
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
nasty things on our windshields in our
 
04:29:46.279 --> 04:29:48.510 align:start position:0%
nasty things on our windshields in our
malls

04:29:48.510 --> 04:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
malls
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh and on in general um we have three
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
times the police that and more fire and
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
especially more EMTs than we would need
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
if those those people weren't coming in
 
04:30:08.269 --> 04:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
and uh it's very difficult to figure
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
out how to plan for that when you're
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
working only with the property taxes of
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
the of the individual town or city so
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
let me let me just ask you this this the
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to gather data
 
04:30:25.229 --> 04:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
correct just to gather data to try to
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
figure that out but you're talking as
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
though that then you'll have more money
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
to do something with it but this is data
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
only so where's that money coming from
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
that is that is the question to be to be
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:30:48.269 --> 04:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
is how can we get more money into these
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
centers this the biggest cities do get I
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
think some federal help and various
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
other kinds of help that we don't get
 
04:30:57.840 --> 04:30:59.149 align:start position:0%
other kinds of help that we don't get
but

04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:04.030 --> 04:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
the the smaller ones are are struggling
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
increasingly I think and the question is
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
just how much data can we get that is
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
going to help
 
04:31:15.630 --> 04:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
us figure out
 
04:31:19.109 --> 04:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
strategies representative said Thank you
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman maybe representative Aly you
 
04:31:25.469 --> 04:31:25.479 align:start position:0%
can correct me I'm not suggesting I'm
 
04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
leaning one way or another on this but
 
04:31:29.550 --> 04:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
the way this reads to me it doesn't
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
speak to any specifics about how how
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
revenues are distributed after the fact
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
the way this reads to me is it's not
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
specific The Operators themselves
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
report when paying their taxes what city
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
or town that those taxes were paid
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
in that is with the
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
Dr they're not Distributing that out for
 
04:31:55.680 --> 04:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
Dr they're not Distributing that out for
report

04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
specifically by vendor or retailer or
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
whatever so the way I see this and
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I I read this as
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
some transparency in reporting a little
 
04:32:15.469 --> 04:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
deeper level of
 
04:32:17.950 --> 04:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
transparency town a brought in $1
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
million Town B brought in $2 million
 
04:32:22.750 --> 04:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of this and you can
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
list the towns out but I don't see any
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
development benefit or anything like
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
that that's not what I'm reading here so
 
04:32:31.279 --> 04:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
that that's not what I'm reading here so
I

04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
guess am I wrong in the way I'm reading
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
this is you know reporting transparency
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
once the information is available at the
 
04:32:47.910 --> 04:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
Dr in a form that the Dr would be
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
willing to provide
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
it it it
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
does help us to some extent but I agree
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's just the first very first step that
 
04:33:03.230 --> 04:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
we've never been able to get
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
over okay um did you have
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
something okay thank you represent Al me
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh I'm sorry I have had on
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
quite a while representative Southworth
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
um partly a point of order I think it's
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
best looked at as a data bill which is
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
kind of how it started 20 minutes ago I
 
04:33:23.470 --> 04:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
think how someone might use the data in
 
04:33:25.789 --> 04:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
the future isn't really relevant to
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill the bill is do we
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
think the data would be useful for our
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee and for other communities as
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
they want to use it but I don't think we
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
need to get into how they might use it
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
but I kind of agree with what you said I
 
04:33:41.470 --> 04:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
mean the wording is that it's a data
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I'd be curious from Dr what
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality is with that
 
04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
reporting yeah okay thank you represent
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
all me um I do have before I call Dr up
 
04:34:09.070 --> 04:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.949 --> 04:34:11.959 align:start position:0%
Tibido good afternoon
 
04:34:11.959 --> 04:34:14.349 align:start position:0%
Tibido good afternoon
my

04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
please uh Kyle Tibido Conway New
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh sit on the board of
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
Selectmen um I guess I am going to be
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
very brief because fortunately for all
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
of us pretty much everything I had on my
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
list has already been said um I I I will
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
say that uh I think that it the the
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
focus does at this point in time uh and
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
I I agree with representative ducet that
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
the focus needs to be on the
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
transparency of the collection process
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
uh I I think we're getting the C in
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
front of the Horse by trying to say that
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at redistribution or
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
or however that might turn out down the
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
road um there are a lot of things that
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
the state would be able to use this
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
information for if they knew exactly
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
where these funds were coming from uh
 
04:35:02.709 --> 04:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
let's say for instance uh town of Conway
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh generates X number of millions of
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
dollars in Mills and rooms tax they
 
04:35:09.269 --> 04:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
might want to take a look at that
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
situation and say okay they've got
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
37,000 people on any given weekend in
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
the town of Conway maybe we need to
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
improve our infrastructure for access to
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
the town of Conway you might be able to
 
04:35:22.349 --> 04:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
use that information for things of that
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
nature um I do know uh that we do need
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh additional help based on uh the fact
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we are probably the third maybe
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
fourth largest tourist area in the state
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh while it is a
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
blessing that we have all of those
 
04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
mountains rivers and Lakes Etc um it it
 
04:35:47.150 --> 04:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
is also a curse that uh like Lebanon uh
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
we end up with a situation where we have
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
double the amount of fire apparatus that
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
we need and triple the uh the police
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
department but I think that's a
 
04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
conversation for a later day I I think
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
now the the important focus should be on
 
04:35:58.959 --> 04:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
now the the important focus should be on
the

04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
transparency of where this money comes
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
from and it's been said I'll say it
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
again rule number one if you're in
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
business and I've been in business for
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
44 years you need to know your Revenue
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
stream you need to know your Revenue
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
stream in detail where it comes from and
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
how it got there um I sent an email to
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
Governor shuno a year ago March um I'm
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
not going to read the whole thing and
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to out paraphrase the
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
majority of it he sent it over to James
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
Jerry uh budget director State of New
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I got some information from Mr
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
Jerry um I asked the pointed question
 
04:36:35.310 --> 04:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
about if you don't know where that money
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
is coming from how do you know that it's
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
being properly and appropriately
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
collected and accounted for and the
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
answer was that we have an aggressive
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
auditing system well your auditing
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
system can be as aggressive if as it
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
wants to be but if you can't pinpoint
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
where the money comes from then what
 
04:36:57.869 --> 04:36:57.879 align:start position:0%
triggers the audit do you just randomly
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
pull names out of a hat to say I think
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
it's time we audit soand so uh or we
 
04:37:04.830 --> 04:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
ought to audit these businesses over
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
here in Berlin or we audit these
 
04:37:09.390 --> 04:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
businesses down here in Manchester uh if
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
you had a more detailed and it doesn't
 
04:37:15.310 --> 04:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
have to be detailed to the point where
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
it becomes onerous on the reporter uh it
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
it only has to be detailed by uh
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
geographic location of the physical
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
collection Point uh if you had that
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
information and you could install
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
certain red flags and trips into your
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
software that would allow uh people to
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
say oh wait a minute uh in Conway New
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they collected X number of
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in rest France last year and all
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
of a sudden uh we down several $100,000
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
in revenues maybe we need to take a look
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
at what's going on in colway New
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I I don't think you have
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
that ability today um and if nothing
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
else I think just for the sake of the
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
State uh upholding its its pledge to be
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
a transparent government I think that
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the municipalities not
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily the public at lodge but at
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
least the people who run municipalities
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the selectman uh Town managers uh um
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
planning boards Etc should be able to
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
access this information to have uh more
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
than a vague idea of what's going on in
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
that town um the it was brought up that
 
04:38:31.470 --> 04:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
if you sit on a planning board you're on
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
a board select you should know what's
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
going on in town well you should but we
 
04:38:37.830 --> 04:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
have something in the neighborhood of
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
3,000 rooms 900 short-term rentals and 6
 
04:38:43.949 --> 04:38:43.959 align:start position:0%
five restaurants in the town of Conway
 
04:38:46.109 --> 04:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely physically impossible
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
for one small fiveman board to keep
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
track of any of this so if we had this
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
information it would allow us to make
 
04:38:55.109 --> 04:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
certain adjustments in how it is that we
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
do things uh to take a better look a how
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
to look at some of the situations that
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
may or may not exist within the town of
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
Conway to be able to better plan better
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
prepare uh things of that nature
 
04:39:11.629 --> 04:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
um most everything else I guess is been
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
hashed over tonight so I won't take any
 
04:39:15.510 --> 04:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
more of your time I thank you for your
 
04:39:17.789 --> 04:39:17.799 align:start position:0%
time thank you do we have questions
 
04:39:17.799 --> 04:39:19.109 align:start position:0%
time thank you do we have questions
represent

04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
opal uh sir I'm fully in support of
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and I I frankly believe as
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Al me talked about there
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues certainly in my area
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
that could be addressed with a more
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
Regional approach or a more Statewide
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
approach um but I will point out I think
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
it was representative Tierney who
 
04:39:42.750 --> 04:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
brought us the letter uh from the Coos
 
04:39:46.390 --> 04:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
delegation and point number one says
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
quantifying meals and rooms taxes at the
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipal level allows for a more
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
precise allocation of tax revenue
 
04:39:55.708 --> 04:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
directly correlating it with the
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
specific local localities that
 
04:39:59.120 --> 04:40:01.350 align:start position:0%
specific local localities that
generate

04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
generate
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
now would you believe I I find that very
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
specifically saying we want the data and
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
then when we have the data we're going
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
to make the argument that communities
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
that generate more tourism revenue or
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms Revenue should get more
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the of the revenue well that that is
 
04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
a distinct possibility um as I said
 
04:40:27.868 --> 04:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
Conway is is kind of an anomaly I I
 
04:40:29.628 --> 04:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
don't think that there are more than
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
four or five areas within uh the state
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that fall within uh the
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh tourist related uh problems that we
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
have um there are a lot of them uh
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
um you have a static population of
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
10,300 people and that is how the rooms
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
and males tax today is distributed based
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
on that static population any given
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
weekend any given vacation week we have
 
04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
35,000 people in town uh we have a
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
police department that's uh two and a
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
half times the size of any other town
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
that has a static population of 10,000
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
people Emergency Services is two to
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
three times as large um our water and
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
sore departments are uh taxed uh
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
severely uh our infrastructure is being
 
04:41:25.470 --> 04:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
abused on a regular basis so would we
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
ask for more money at some point in time
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know but step one is to find out
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
where that money comes from and at some
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
point uh it should become a little bit
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
more proportional uh in my
 
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
opinion so I don't yeah thank you Mr
 
04:41:44.910 --> 04:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I I don't disagree with you
 
04:41:46.030 --> 04:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
just as I don't disagree with
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative Aly um what I do believe
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is pitting one
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
town against another town when the
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
entire state gets a benefit from tourism
 
04:42:00.430 --> 04:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the Conway area the entire State
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
frankly certainly the region gets a
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
benefit from what Lebanon does the
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
entire state gets a benefit from some of
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
these tourism and and Municipal hubs um
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm afraid of would you
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
believe is the idea of pitting one town
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
against another so that Conway gets an
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
decrease yeah this may be something that
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have to discuss during a work
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
session um thank you very much for your
 
04:42:38.190 --> 04:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh lastly I'll
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.600 --> 04:42:56.788 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Jennifer Ramsey tax
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
policy Council for the Department of
 
04:43:01.080 --> 04:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
policy Council for the Department of
Revenue

04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
Administration lots of questions um
 
04:43:07.868 --> 04:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful if I if I provided
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
just a brief um overview I I have heard
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of of what I think may be some
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about how the tax works
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what uh information the department
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
collects and um if you'd like me too I
 
04:43:20.910 --> 04:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
could just give a minute or two on that
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds good and then we'll go
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
from there thank you um so remember from
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
the presentation on the 21st the meals
 
04:43:31.390 --> 04:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax is a tax on the consumer
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the meal or the room uh or the
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle rle and uh operators of those
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
businesses uh get a license from Dr and
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
they are the tax collector for the State
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh so each operator files a return with
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
us monthly um and those operators are
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
the people who we would audit um in the
 
04:43:58.590 --> 04:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
case of uh a concern about whether or
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
not they're paying an appropriate amount
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
they retain a 3% commission provided
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
that they file using our electronic
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
portal and that they file on time and
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they remit the right amount of tax
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
with their return
 
04:44:16.350 --> 04:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
um this group of operators ranges from
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated to Not So
 
04:44:22.110 --> 04:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
Sophisticated um it's a significant part
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
of our call center volume is is uh
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
assisting these taxpayers with with uh
 
04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
getting their forms into us the correct
 
04:44:30.040 --> 04:44:32.070 align:start position:0%
getting their forms into us the correct
way

04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:44:37.150 --> 04:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
um we do have uh as representative paig
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
said people that file on a Consolidated
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
basis um so if an operator has locations
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
in 10 15 places within the state of New
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they will pick a single
 
04:44:51.150 --> 04:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
location we call that a master license
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
under our rules and they will report all
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
the revenue for their Collective
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
businesses using that one location uh
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
they uh may also be out of state um
 
04:45:08.110 --> 04:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
operators in the case of um large
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
National chains um also are room rental
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
facilitators and so some operators don't
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
even have a c a New Hampshire County um
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
so to get to the questions about
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
confidentiality under RSA 21
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
j14 um the department has a
 
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
long-standing policy of not reporting
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
information that would um potentially
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
identify a taxpayer and their liability
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
and we interpret that to mean for data
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
um we do not report a piece of data that
 
04:45:48.030 --> 04:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
is the aggregate of less than 10
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and at the local level um that
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
limit is 20
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um so the information that
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would have us um provide is
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
not something that we currently have
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
because we do not ask the operators of
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
the businesses that file on a combined
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
basis to tell us what town
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
the meal was consumed in or the room is
 
04:46:17.070 --> 04:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
located in they have that information
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
and we can get to it if we audit but
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we routinely
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
collect we could collect that
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
information um it would require us to
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
develop a new and much more detailed
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
form uh We've looked at what some other
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions use for forms um we would
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
essentially need to have a line for each
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
town and have operators fill in the town
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh where the revenue was generated the
 
04:46:49.990 --> 04:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
amount as well as the number of
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
businesses in that town if we created
 
04:46:55.390 --> 04:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
that much more complicated tax form um
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
we could then gather the information
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is sought by this bill and reported
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
out um the cost to do that uh I heard a
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
comment that $50,000 seemed like a lot
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
of money the reason that that expense is
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
what it is is because we have to have a
 
04:47:13.868 --> 04:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
paper form and that paper form has to go
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
through our very high-speed scanner and
 
04:47:19.390 --> 04:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
we have to work with a vendor to test to
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
develop and then test that form and make
 
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
sure that it would capture every single
 
04:47:28.430 --> 04:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
one of those four or 500 Blanks on that
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
much more complex tax form accurately
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
and put that into our data system um I
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was all of the
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions but but maybe a good point to
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
stop thank you representative du set and
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think you answered
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
though at present someone can't go to Dr
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
and request the receipts of a
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
specific uh taxpayer that's correct we
 
04:47:58.830 --> 04:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
would not ever
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
disclose not change that I'm sorry
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
obviously if this were to be uh passed
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
as written it wouldn't change that
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's a different it's not a 91a thing
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that right we have our
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
a very specific uh RSA 21 j14 is our
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
statute we are also subject to 91a but
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
um the tax statute is a little bit
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
broader protection so we typically look
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
to that and if I'm interpreting this
 
04:48:27.030 --> 04:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill correctly then um we would still
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
not be required to provide a specific
 
04:48:31.628 --> 04:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers information but we would
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
provide aggregated by Town information
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
so long as there were more than 10 data
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
points within that or operators within
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
that town
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth uh thank you
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
question um kind of of another one
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
attached so um if Jones Hardware has a
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
store in Portsmouth and a store in Salem
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh and a store in Plymouth um and they
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
send in that information uh there's no
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
way uh an outside person can compare
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
those three
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
Stores um well if they were paying u ms
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
and reyolds tax um then they would
 
04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
report that information using a master
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
license and um the they know the three
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
but no one else could get that
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
information correct well our Auditors
 
04:49:24.270 --> 04:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
could if we needed to but but it's it's
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
not a part of the tax form that they
 
04:49:28.510 --> 04:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
send in and is your request uh I mean
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
I'm requesting can you say again the cut
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
offs for confidentiality because several
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
people asked about that yes at the state
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
level when the data is aggregated at the
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
state level um we will not disclose
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
anything with 10 or fewer taxpayers at
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
any level below the state so county or
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
city or or town um it's 20 tax pairs
 
04:49:49.360 --> 04:49:50.070 align:start position:0%
city or or town um it's 20 tax pairs
thank

04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
you so this bill actually says 10 so you
 
04:49:58.110 --> 04:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
would probably want that to say 20 um to
 
04:50:00.070 --> 04:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
be consistent with our existing policy I
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
think that would be prudent but it it we
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
would follow whatever the law was that
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
established anybody
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
else okay okay seeing none thank you
 
04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%

Bill M from City of nashwa Hillsboro
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
10 speaking to House Bill 540 relative
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the horse racing licenses for large
 
04:54:38.230 --> 04:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
second I'd like to start by talking
 
04:54:43.150 --> 04:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
about our current situation with the
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
large casinos that we uh have and are
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
possible to have in New Hampshire based
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
on current law and I Define a large
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
Casino as a property with over 1,000
 
04:54:59.310 --> 04:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.628 --> 04:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
machines we have a situation where we
 
04:55:05.310 --> 04:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
have 14 chable gaming properties with
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
licenses for historic racing
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
machines and these are very popular
 
04:55:13.548 --> 04:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
licenses uh they're so popular that the
 
04:55:16.270 --> 04:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
smaller mom and pop gambling operations
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
are now being purchased by larger
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
entities for major
 
04:55:22.990 --> 04:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
expansions for example here in the city
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
of nasua where I live we're about to
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
have the Lars uh Casino The
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
Edge um I'm sorry the Nash thank you uh
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
being developed at the former Sears
 
04:55:40.030 --> 04:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
property and that's about to open next
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
month month and expected to have well
 
04:55:44.430 --> 04:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
over a thousand machines and be a very
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.110 --> 04:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
entertainment so what's the
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem well we've been very generous
 
04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
with the licensing of these large
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
casinos if you wanted a
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh terrible gaming license in the past
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's a very modest fee as it should be
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you had a card room with a couple of
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
tables 250 bucks for a license
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
fee um and we had a very successful
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
terrible gaming operations that we still
 
04:56:24.270 --> 04:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
do but under current
 
04:56:24.280 --> 04:56:26.030 align:start position:0%
do but under current
law

04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh operators are committed to sell that
 
04:56:31.390 --> 04:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
business to a larger
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
partner and the larger partner is
 
04:56:33.480 --> 04:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
partner and the larger partner is
allowed

04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
04:56:37.548 --> 04:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
to decide if that site's appropriate for
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
them and if it's not appropriate in
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
terms of size and opportunity they're
 
04:56:44.190 --> 04:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to move that location to another
 
04:56:47.430 --> 04:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
location within that jurisdiction so for
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
example in Nashville we've had a couple
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
of small tural casinos we had the river
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
and we've had the uh uh lucky
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
moose they've morphed from uh from card
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
games into historic racing machines with
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
their HHR licenses these have been
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
bought out Delaware North and E
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
entertainment in particular and now
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
these properties are being relocated to
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
venues the one I mentioned previously
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Sears venue is about to open next
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
month and the other
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
property uh owned by Del North is the
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
former Sheran Tara on exit W NASA and I
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
believe the intention there is to
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
convert the hotel into a hotel casino
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
with the license for historic gaming as
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
being the main driver for that
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity so what's the profitability
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
of these uh
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
machines and what's the cost to get a
 
04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
license well one of the
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
handouts uh in title of Massachusetts
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
gives you a point of reference for what
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions are looking at for
 
04:58:02.000 --> 04:58:03.948 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions are looking at for
large

04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
casinos if you want to place a large
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
Casino in Massachusetts such as the
 
04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
encor downtown Everett next to Boston or
 
04:58:15.070 --> 04:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
the MTM
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
Springfield or the plane view uh former
 
04:58:21.868 --> 04:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
horse track it's a very serious uh
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity and a very serious license
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
fee for example the Everett casino and
 
04:58:32.310 --> 04:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
the Springfield casinos have a initial
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
million that compares to a 20 50 license
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
fee for similar property in New
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
generous uh I suggest that the
 
04:58:56.750 --> 04:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh change of the chable gaming from a
 
04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
small mom and pop C operation to a large
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
Casino would um be appropriate to look
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
at a different license fee and that's
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
what my bill
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
does the license fees for uh facilities
 
04:59:16.350 --> 04:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts are $85 million or
 
04:59:19.868 --> 04:59:19.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps $25 million my bill says how
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
about $10 million free your Casino
 
04:59:25.470 --> 04:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
license instead of
 
04:59:29.310 --> 04:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
$250 well can The Operators afford this
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
we had testimony yesterday from the
 
04:59:34.350 --> 04:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission on how well the ATR
 
04:59:35.548 --> 04:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
machines are doing and they're doing
 
04:59:35.558 --> 04:59:37.150 align:start position:0%
machines are doing and they're doing
quite

04:59:37.150 --> 04:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
well uh the testimony was if my notes
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
are correct cor was that the average HR
 
04:59:46.590 --> 04:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
machine would take in
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
$239 per
 
04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
day and that trend is likely to go
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
upward to as much as 400 bucks a
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
day well let's say the machine takes in
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
$239 a day and you have a large casino
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
with a th000 slot
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
$239,000 per day
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
or if you analyze that that's $87
 
05:00:19.030 --> 05:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
million per year in Gross slot revenue
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
for each
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
Casino so of that money it's uh under
 
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
the current split it's pretty generous
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
operator the uh facility May generate
 
05:00:34.160 --> 05:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
operator the uh facility May generate
$87

05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
$87
 
05:00:38.110 --> 05:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
million in slot revenue and they get to
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
keep 75% of that
 
05:00:44.350 --> 05:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.070 --> 05:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
million the 25% they don't keep gets
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
split between the Lottery Commission and
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
charity that hasn't
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
changed so the operator takes in $87
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
million they keep 75% so they wind up
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
with $65 million of gross
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
revenue now those of us you know with a
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
business background say what's the cost
 
05:01:08.430 --> 05:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
of goods
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
here well your cost of goods is the
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
Box you buy a
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
robot you feed the robot
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
electricity and you open up the back
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
money 75% gross
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
margins so I suggest that a operator
 
05:01:33.990 --> 05:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
with that kind of gross
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
margin uh can certainly afford a $10
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
million license fee per year for this
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise now you can ask maybe
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
operators might be smaller another all
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
not all operators will have a $10
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
million uh exposure for the amount of
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
machines they have they may only have a
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
smaller number so I think it's
 
05:01:57.070 --> 05:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable to say we can look at a a
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
sliding scale on this which would be $10
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
million for a th000 machines and then
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
slide down to you
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
know uh very modest amount for one or
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
two machines and that's certainly a
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable alternative to my proposal
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd asked the committee to consider
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale as well as a fixed fee
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.270 --> 05:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:02:25.510 --> 05:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
Southworth GNA call on you first thank
 
05:02:27.628 --> 05:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
you and uh thank you for taking my
 
05:02:30.430 --> 05:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
question um I was thinking at the very
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
beginning about the um cut off at a
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
thousand um I in your conclusion you
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned a sliding scale but there's
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
nothing about a sliding scale in the
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
bill are you thinking there should be an
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm thinking two things
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
the words but also do you think the bill
 
05:02:49.150 --> 05:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
should actually have the scale or leave
 
05:02:52.350 --> 05:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
that to rules for someone yeah um I'm
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
just starting to deal with the immediate
 
05:02:56.190 --> 05:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
problem facing the city of Nashville
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
with two very large casinos having over
 
05:03:01.628 --> 05:03:01.638 align:start position:0%
1,000 slot machines and let's deal with
 
05:03:01.638 --> 05:03:02.948 align:start position:0%
1,000 slot machines and let's deal with
that

05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
quickly but long term I fully support a
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
sliding scale and I could certainly do a
 
05:03:14.830 --> 05:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
purpose yes representative Spire thank
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh the um the there I
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
think almost every state has some sort
 
05:03:26.548 --> 05:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
of gambling or games uh the with the
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
states out there I see that the feed
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to do is based on the
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
type of game do you see that other
 
05:03:34.110 --> 05:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
states do it by the game do they do it
 
05:03:36.548 --> 05:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
by a percentage of their gross revenue
 
05:03:38.590 --> 05:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any idea how it's
 
05:03:40.110 --> 05:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
handled in other states yes
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
predominately yeah I'll defer uh
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre on the details of the
 
05:03:47.470 --> 05:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
other states but my belief it's uh
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's a a fee per machine was a fee
 
05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
per machine yeah some for example
 
05:03:56.350 --> 05:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
licensing fees uh typically a state
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
would license an individual machine for
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
about 600
 
05:04:02.400 --> 05:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
about 600
bucks

05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you and the revenue is
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
Consolidated among all the machines some
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
machines are lucky they that day and not
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
lucky another day but it's the
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Revenue that the operator
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
number representative D
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
said Thank you Mr chairman I'll just be
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
real brief because I'm sure there there
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
are others I'm just curious as to how
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
how do we impose a $10 million tax on
 
05:04:38.110 --> 05:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
operators that are already operating
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
that complied with all our rules rules
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
statutes that have
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
invested millions of dollars into this
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
effort we show up on the door knock on
 
05:04:50.350 --> 05:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
the door and say all of a sudden you owe
 
05:04:52.510 --> 05:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire $10 million
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
how how do we enforce that and how do we
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
avoid the
 
05:04:58.948 --> 05:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
incoming uh lawsuits and sure well the
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
first thing is when's the bill
 
05:05:04.548 --> 05:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
effective my bill is effective January 1
 
05:05:06.990 --> 05:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
of next
 
05:05:10.110 --> 05:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
year there's also a three-year license
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
license we can determine when's the
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
right time to cut in such a
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
fee do we do it at the end of the of the
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
gaming cycle license
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
cycle okay we could we could do that
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
with a lot of businesses in the state
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
the fact remains
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
is people made an
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
investment and we're basically changing
 
05:05:41.470 --> 05:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
the rules midstream does
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't calculate here to
 
05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
me thank you for the question I would
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
point out that tax law changes all the
 
05:05:50.350 --> 05:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
time we've changed the business taxes
 
05:05:52.990 --> 05:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
constantly uh we announce the changes we
 
05:05:54.670 --> 05:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't make them
 
05:05:57.310 --> 05:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
retroactive and we could decide what's
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a tax at the time we
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
look at the situation at the time we
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
looked at the taxes for charitable
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
gaming was very modest it was a modest
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise now we have a major
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
Enterprise I think it's to look at the
 
05:06:10.200 --> 05:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
Enterprise I think it's to look at the
tax

05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
again followup yeah just one more
 
05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
followup so this is just in relation to
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
the machines
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you oh absolutely yeah
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
this is a tax on the machines this is
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
100% related to the historic horse race
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
machines and no other part of the
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise representative Brier thank
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
question um I'm relatively new to uh
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
this committee and I'm relatively new to
 
05:06:47.548 --> 05:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh this gaming and casinos uh but what
 
05:06:51.150 --> 05:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing around is uh just within my
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
house we uh I think it's called Revo or
 
05:06:56.910 --> 05:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
something there's one in there's one in
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
dolba I know that Rochester is talking
 
05:07:02.430 --> 05:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
about putting one at the Lilac mall and
 
05:07:04.990 --> 05:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little bit confused because it
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're becoming like meain
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and actually having
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
real casinos and why are we still
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
calling it charitable gaming again I'm
 
05:07:17.310 --> 05:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
very new to this and uh I think we're
 
05:07:19.310 --> 05:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
missing out on some huge Revenue
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities that other states are
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
getting and we do have a revenue problem
 
05:07:27.548 --> 05:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
right now in the state and uh I guess my
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
question is what is there are we is part
 
05:07:32.110 --> 05:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
of this doing some sort of study to look
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
at like should we be changing our model
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
and looking at opportunities like this
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question we've
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
had a gaming
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
commission uh or study on a gaming
 
05:07:46.150 --> 05:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
commission uh ongoing for the past two
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
years representative set could comment
 
05:07:48.360 --> 05:07:49.830 align:start position:0%
years representative set could comment
on

05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
that well we just we just passed a bill
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday out of this
 
05:07:58.590 --> 05:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
committee if I if I might just uh
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
because it's relative I think that if if
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
in fact the new
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission gets seated that there are so
 
05:08:10.750 --> 05:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
many issues in relation to charitable
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
gaming dispersion of funds I I mean that
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
the list is long this this is a a
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
commission that probably should be a
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
permanent commission at some point and I
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
think we all on the commission have
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
agreed with that and there are a plenty
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
addressed I would just summarize say my
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
bills a
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid I'm dealing with the facts on
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
the ground today do we want to wait
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
another two years do we want to do
 
05:08:41.948 --> 05:08:41.958 align:start position:0%
something sooner do we want to do
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
something never I throw that question to
 
05:08:48.548 --> 05:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
committee any other questions okay
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh next I have Alicia
 
05:09:01.320 --> 05:09:11.948 align:start position:0%
representative uh next I have Alicia
Preston

05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
hello thank you Mr chairman and members
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Alicia
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
Preston I'm here representing the New
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable gaming operators
 
05:09:20.350 --> 05:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
Association and we are speaking today in
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill just for a little background
 
05:09:25.628 --> 05:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
currently there are approximately only
 
05:09:27.708 --> 05:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
2,000 historic horse racing machines in
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
operation in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they're operating across 10 separate
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
facilities so while this would not
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
affect anyone today this would
 
05:09:36.670 --> 05:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely impede growth of the industry
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
and therefore growth of Revenue to the
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
state most importantly to the 800 plus
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
Charities a benefit from the industry
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
right now over the summer and the fall
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
has been referenced a few times here uh
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
charity gaming study commission looked
 
05:09:50.590 --> 05:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
at this issue as well as several others
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
as part of this review they engaged a
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
third party Spectrum gaming group to
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
look into and conduct an analysis on the
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
market they came back and determined
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
that in the long run the maximum
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
saturation of these HHR machines in New
 
05:10:05.548 --> 05:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be approximately
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
6,300 beyond that the M Market could
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
just not sustain and any more machines
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
for the market that is before us the
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
concept that there will be more than
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
1,000 machines at several facilities is
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
simply not realistic and would not be
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
sustainable however if one or more
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
larger facilities were to support such a
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
big amount we believe that would only be
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
a great benefit to both the state and of
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
course to the Charities if a facility
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
were to be charged $10 million by going
 
05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
over 999 machines they're simply not
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to go over 999 machines the
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
revenue differential just is not there
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
what does that do that limits growth to
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
the industry and it limits revenues to
 
05:10:42.750 --> 05:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state and to
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
Charities as part of its review the
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
gaming study commission did look at
 
05:10:47.948 --> 05:10:47.958 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for charitable gaming
 
05:10:49.548 --> 05:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
operators and determin the gaming
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
revenues from table games and HHR more
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
than covered the expenses of regulation
 
05:10:55.150 --> 05:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and they
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
did discuss a tiered system for
 
05:11:00.590 --> 05:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
different sizes of uh facilities and
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
they determined that that was
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as well historically New
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has always rejected High
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
licensing fees across Industries because
 
05:11:09.670 --> 05:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's impediment to growth and we see
 
05:11:11.310 --> 05:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
that in industries that have grown
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
developed and evolved in the state over
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
many many decades I'm happy to answer
 
05:11:14.760 --> 05:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
many many decades I'm happy to answer
any

05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:11:24.788 --> 05:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think I heard uh an
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that there's a 75%
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
profit margin to The Operators maybe you
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
can break that down for us no so the 75
 
05:11:35.230 --> 05:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
is um with HHR 90% of the wages are
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
given back to the players approximately
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
that means 10% is held of that 25% is
 
05:11:41.910 --> 05:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
given to the state and to the Charities
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
what's a major factor missing in that is
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
these machines have a cost of upwards of
 
05:11:49.390 --> 05:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
15 to 18% through the manufacturer and
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
the vendor so you're looking at the tax
 
05:11:54.030 --> 05:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
an immediate fee not including
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
employment and all that of anywhere from
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
39 to 47% is what they're paying right
 
05:12:00.510 --> 05:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
gate does that mean the machines are
 
05:12:05.590 --> 05:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
leased and not sold it some are bought
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
some are leased but they also have to
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
manage the programs within it and how
 
05:12:12.390 --> 05:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
the payouts are done so you can't unlike
 
05:12:13.628 --> 05:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
certain other games you can't just buy
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
the machine and house it in your
 
05:12:18.030 --> 05:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
facility okay thank
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative ORS thank you
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
question so is the actual operator take
 
05:12:30.160 --> 05:12:31.948 align:start position:0%
question so is the actual operator take
about

05:12:31.948 --> 05:12:31.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:12:36.190 --> 05:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
30% of from historic horse racing no the
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
well no the operator take from historic
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
horse racing by these numbers would be
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from I'm doing quick math
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
pardon me uh I guess 53 to
 
05:12:52.270 --> 05:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
61% I'm doing quick math so they've got
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
25% and then an additional 15 to 18%
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
which I guess would be 37% to 40 oh got
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
it okay the way yes now I got it my
 
05:13:03.548 --> 05:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
sorry for
 
05:13:06.190 --> 05:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
confusing okay seeing no more questions
 
05:13:06.200 --> 05:13:06.948 align:start position:0%
confusing okay seeing no more questions
thank

05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
you and
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.548 --> 05:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
lottery good afternoon Mr chairman
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Charlie
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
McIntyre Lottery Commission and with me
 
05:13:34.270 --> 05:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
our compliance officer kolia Royal uh
 
05:13:35.390 --> 05:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things you wanted to note for
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee is I
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
believe we were asked to do a fiscal
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
note and we submitted one
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.360 --> 05:13:45.868 align:start position:0%
 
bill

05:13:45.868 --> 05:13:45.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
I yeah I do not have any piscal notes
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
but I can explain to you in short order
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
essentially we characterize the revenue
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
is is essentially zero only because the
 
05:13:59.708 --> 05:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
size of the rooms in question are not
 
05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to be that much larger than a
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
thousand machines and the cost to go
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
from a, one up would be prohibitive to
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
any room and so if you're if that the
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
dividing line it would be likely they
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
would just have
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
995 which would candidly be a nightmare
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
for us because at any point in time one
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
to two% of the machines are out of order
 
05:14:22.910 --> 05:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
being moved being replaced and so it's a
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
it would be a logistical difficulty but
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I would
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
imagine because that's funny large is in
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
context so everyone thinks I'm tall but
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
my son is four inches taller than I am
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
and so to him I am not tall um similarly
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
there are more machines in Twin Rivers
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
times two than there are in the entirey
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the state all rooms combined so
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
there's no technically large
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
Casino boxwoods has I think 5,000
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
machines in it mohagen sun probably has
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
four and so that's a large Casino in our
 
05:14:59.948 --> 05:14:59.958 align:start position:0%
estimation so a thousand is not we
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
consider large there isn't it would be
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
the smallest one in Massachusetts I
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
think Springfield has 2,000 or 1500 I
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
think plane has 1250 Encore has over
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
3,000 and so those are larger facilities
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so for us a th000 would not be a
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
large operation anyway and I'm happy I
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to take more too much of your
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
time but I'm here to answer any
 
05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
questions Co and I here to answer any
 
05:15:26.990 --> 05:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions you folks have regarding
 
05:15:30.030 --> 05:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
anything representative Southworth thank
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
question would you have a different
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
analysis if there were some kind of
 
05:15:39.628 --> 05:15:39.638 align:start position:0%
chart about a tiered system
 
05:15:41.948 --> 05:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly the the impact of what
 
05:15:44.230 --> 05:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
you assess is a policy decision for you
 
05:15:46.548 --> 05:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
folks not us but there's really three
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
levers to pull when you're talking about
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
citing a gaming facility there's how
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
much a license fee you make them pay
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
what you make them pay as a going
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
concern and then what you make them do
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
to build it in the first place and I'll
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
give you an example uh the Cino in
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Encore in Boston
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
upfront was an $85 million license fee
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
they then were required to build a $2.4
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
billion facility for which they had to
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
pay the tax rate of the machines is 25%
 
05:16:19.470 --> 05:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
and so those are the three economic
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
levers as a state you make them do or
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
not do and so um but that's a long way
 
05:16:27.310 --> 05:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
of saying decisions regarding the
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
percentages are up to you folks I have
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
they're representative thank you Mr
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
good to see again so uh the one line
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
here that the New Hampshire HHR license
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
fee is
 
05:16:48.110 --> 05:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
$250 I mean in in just from all the
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
numbers here you know from that to 10
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
million whatever but does that seem
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
artificially low to me I mean is there a
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
number that would actually help the
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
exercise it's an academic exercise it's
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
um it's obviously historic it's not
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
relates to what exists now it's what was
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
before I think a a game operator
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
employer license I think it's $
 
05:17:18.270 --> 05:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
850 it's $850 that's our most expensive
 
05:17:21.150 --> 05:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
license and it's you know a Minimus
 
05:17:23.548 --> 05:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
given the numbers we're talking about
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
follow follow thank you for that so what
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
about the just some of the discussion
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
about the bigger bigger Casino operators
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
buying up the small Mom and Pops and you
 
05:17:36.990 --> 05:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned Twin River so this is this a
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
problem in the state or not
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know I'm allowed to change my mind
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
originally I thought it would be a
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
problem to have the very large operators
 
05:17:48.510 --> 05:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
come in and take ownership of these
 
05:17:50.590 --> 05:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
things and in the last three years I've
 
05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
completely done a 180 and the largest
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
most professional operators are the ones
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
who are doing it the tightest they're
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
the ones who literally you can't have a
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
speeding ticket and work for some of
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
these operators and so um I have it
 
05:18:06.548 --> 05:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
completely turned around in terms of my
 
05:18:08.548 --> 05:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
opinion my fear was the large operators
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
coming in and making these large
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
facilities and not caring about our
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
state and our communities and I've been
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
turned around on that thank
 
05:18:20.830 --> 05:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
you uh yes Ros Malloy thank you Mr chair
 
05:18:22.548 --> 05:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do the
 
05:18:25.390 --> 05:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
machines in uh New
 
05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh reap uh as like any machine
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the United States is there a
 
05:18:34.270 --> 05:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
a are these all standard machines that
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
work the same system
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere so um the short answer is yes
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
and no so I don't want to sound like a
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer unfortunately thank you you're
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
talking to two of them um the physical
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
box is the same the communications
 
05:18:56.110 --> 05:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
method to the machine is the same
 
05:18:57.788 --> 05:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
there's surveillance equipment that
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
governs all every machine is under
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
camera all times in operation the same
 
05:19:04.430 --> 05:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of cash flow that comes in
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
and out and the tracking of that is the
 
05:19:07.708 --> 05:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
same all the internal controls are the
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
same anti money laundering principles
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
are the same it's the content inside the
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
box that gets
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
displayed and more importantly the back
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
office math that's different because it
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
relates to pools in terms of horse
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
racing which is what's makes it historic
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
horse racing versus a true classic video
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminal which you would also
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
characterize as a slot machine because
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
the players are playing in theory
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
against each other versus you're playing
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
directly Against the Machine which is
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
more popular with the players that's a a
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
guy could really geek out if you want
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
but I figure that's a good
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
answer representa duet thank you Mr
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
chairman we're at present in a
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislative moratorium for expansion
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
right now and we made that legislative
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess I can't ask you your opinion
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
on this but can you tell me when that
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
moratorium is up on
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
HHR it's my understanding was seven
 
05:20:12.030 --> 05:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
years from last July 1st for the
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium and can the moratorium was
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
passed I believe with pretty bipartisan
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
support in the belief that we should
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
sort of build this out see where it gets
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
and then make a decision which is the
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
reason the Z representative the
 
05:20:25.990 --> 05:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
commission is for 10 years uh and as a
 
05:20:29.548 --> 05:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
member of it I believe still um it's
 
05:20:31.230 --> 05:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term look at this only
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
because like the Nash is opening next
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
month we don't know like we're there
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but we don't know what the
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
impact that's going to have in the
 
05:20:40.270 --> 05:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
community long-term shortterm we'll
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
visit it and we'll we'll follow up and
 
05:20:44.708 --> 05:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
we'll see but it's we're still building
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
it follow up and would you agree with me
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's my belief that the commission if
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
establish this should be an issue that
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
is directly taken up with that
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
commission also yes and as you were
 
05:20:59.548 --> 05:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier representative quite
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
accurately there are a number of issues
 
05:21:04.110 --> 05:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be taken up by thank
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
you yes represent elberger thank you Mr
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for my question I don't
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
know a way to put this without sounding
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit crude but are there any
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
casino operators in the state that are
 
05:21:18.240 --> 05:21:19.310 align:start position:0%

05:21:22.590 --> 05:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
question representative it's nice not to

05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
Ed to a large extent I'm not asking for
 
05:21:43.708 --> 05:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
