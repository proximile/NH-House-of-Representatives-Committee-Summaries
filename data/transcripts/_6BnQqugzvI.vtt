00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
foreign everybody I'm going to open this
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session for hb221
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the acquisition of
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
agricultural land development rights
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
so we are here this morning
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.060 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
intends to do
 
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:15.740 align:start position:0%
and how we may
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we need to do to solve a
 
00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:20.930 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we need to do to solve a
problem

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
that is I guess apparent
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby do you have some
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
each point of this bill is to make it
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
easier to preserve agricultural land in
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire please use your
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
um yes okay so the the key point of this
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill is to make it easier to preserve
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural land in New Hampshire and
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have on in our statutes a land
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
present an agricultural land
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
preservation program that was developed
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s and at the point when it
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
was developed uh the American Farmland
 
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.540 align:start position:0%
trust was barely coming into existence
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
The Nature Conservancy was ignoring
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
agricultural land and uh there were a
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
number of other
 
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
number of other
um

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
and land preservation preserving
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
organizations that hadn't even thought
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
about organizing yet uh and uh so uh a
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the language in this re reflects
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
the methods that were available in the
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
1980s for preserving agricultural land
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what is now
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
um available which is much more robust
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
and uh it has uh one of the things that
 
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:48.740 align:start position:0%
uh was the case in the 1980s was that
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
the in New Hampshire the Department of
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
Agriculture was pretty much the only
 
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
game in town preserving agricultural
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
land uh and now there are many
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
organizations which are doing that are
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
actually in many ways better suited to
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
doing that than the department but on
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
being able to cooperate with the
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
Department strength would strengthen
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
their uh their programs as well so
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
what this bill the main purpose is that
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
this bill is to make it easier for other
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
land preservation programs that are
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
interested in working with agricultural
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
land preserve uh and work with the
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
Department to preserve land and get rid
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
of the impediments and statute that make
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
that harder uh and I'm going to ask uh
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um which one of you uh Jeremy are you
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
the best person to talk to this okay so
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask Jeremy Lucci to come up
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
and explain uh how the proposed
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have before you would
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Lucci you are with Department of
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.650 align:start position:0%
Mr Lucci you are with Department of
Agriculture

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
Agriculture
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
sure yes
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
I have some prepared remarks and then
 
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy to answer any questions
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
so first of all thank you
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
Representatives Bigsby Kaplan and Aaron
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
for supporting this important bill
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
with a goal to amend the language of RSA
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
432 to provide the state of New
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with an ability to hold a
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
right of enforcement to the agricultural
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
land development rights rather than hold
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
the rights themselves
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
this flexibility will allow New
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's land trusts to use the Alp
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
available through the U.S Department of
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
agriculture's Natural Resources
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
conservation service agricultural
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
conservation easement program
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
the acronym is ASAP
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
ASAP provides critical assistance for
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
Farmland conservation in New Hampshire
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
but in order to leverage those federal
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
dollars effectively land trusts must
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
find matching dollars at the state and
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
local level
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
without these matching funds the federal
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
dollars go unspent
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
particularly in the wake of the upcoming
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
U.S farm bill which is predicted to
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase those Farmland
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
protection funds
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to step back a little
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
bit and for those of you not well versed
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
in Farmland protection
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to provide a few statistics
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
regarding Farmland in New Hampshire
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
and before I do so I'd respectfully ask
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
you a series of simple questions about
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
whether Farmland protection is a
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
important to your everyday life here in
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
do you eat food and if so do you know
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
where that food comes from
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
are you certain that food will always be
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
available and if so what guarantees do
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
if our International Food supply chain
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
were disrupted by drought flood war or
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic how would New Hampshire
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
citizens feed themselves
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire doesn't protect its
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
remaining Farmland where will we turn
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
when the grocery stores shelves are
 
00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:07.009 align:start position:0%
when the grocery stores shelves are
empty

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
empty
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
from 1925 to 2008 New Hampshire lost 90
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
percent of its farmland
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
according to American Farmland trust New
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lost another 11 600 acres
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
of Farmland from 2001 to 2016.
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
and at this pace New Hampshire is
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
predicted to lose another 35 000 Acres
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
of Farmland by 2040. once lost that land
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
is almost never returned to use as a
 
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.970 align:start position:0%
is almost never returned to use as a
farm

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
farm
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire more than five
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
times as many farmers are over the age
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
of 65 as under age 35 meaning that a
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
remaining Farmland will be extremely
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
susceptible to conversion over the next
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
15 to 25 years
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
land trusts like Southeast Land Trust
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
protect hundreds of Acres of Farmland in
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire each year
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
using programs like the federal ASAP
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
program when we protect Farmland we
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
often see that communities in New
 
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.990 align:start position:0%
often see that communities in New
Hampshire

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
with less financial resources are unable
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
to protect their Farms because it costs
 
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
too much
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
without a dedicated funding source for
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
Farmland protection at the state level
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's accessible to land trusts
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
less affluent communities often miss out
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
a loss not only for the farmer and the
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
municipality but for the State of New
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in general because we lose the
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
ability to feed ourselves in times of
 
00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:29.329 align:start position:0%
ability to feed ourselves in times of
need

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the proposed changes to House Bill
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
221 Land Trust will be able to use these
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
Alp funds to leverage the federal
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
funding programs and protect the last of
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Farmland before they are
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
lost forever
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
your next meal may depend on it
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I'm happy to
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I think you
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
already received a document from the New
 
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Food Alliance
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussing why this bill is important
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Lucci it is Lucci right yes yes thank
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming this morning and
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
helping us out to work through some
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill so the original
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
is sort of a one-line change to statute
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
are you talking about that that bill or
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's another document that has been
 
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.230 align:start position:0%
there's another document that has been
uh

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
distributed that has some other changes
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
in it is this the one that you're
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
speaking of or the original Bill yes so
 
00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459 align:start position:0%
the the original bill that was filed had
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
a very important change that would allow
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
the state to hold the right of
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement as opposed to the the
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
agricultural preservation restriction
 
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.110 align:start position:0%
agricultural preservation restriction
itself

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
that is very important change but these
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
other changes that have been passed
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
around are also critical so that the New
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land trusts will be able to
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
work with federal agencies to leverage
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
those federal funds land trusts in New
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most of us are accredited by
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
the land trust Alliance and without
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
these additional changes we would not be
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
able to use these Alp funds so the
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
additional changes that were were shared
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
will allow us to do so
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions from the
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee subcommittee
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:26.569 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee subcommittee
representative

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
huh representative
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I actually have two ones very simple
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
can I have a copy of your written
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
remarks absolutely thank you
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
um and once Farmland is put it put into
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
a land trust are there any stipulations
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
to the farmers themselves on what the
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
use of that property can be
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes so uh when using the Alp funding
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
um there's a limitation on buildings
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
only agricultural buildings could be
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
constructed on the property and when
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
they're working with land trusts or with
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
any of the federal funds there's a two
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
percent limitation on the amount of
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
buildings covering uh that land so
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does is it it forces
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
the farmers to keep that Land open and
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
when you say only two percent of
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
buildings on that property is that after
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
it's put into Land Trust because
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
um what if they needed to build a uh
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
like a processing plant or a processing
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
facility on that property to deal with
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
what they're producing would that and it
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
was over two percent so that would not
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
be able to be put on the property is
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
that the understanding yeah over two
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
percent would be an incredibly large
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
building so if you're talking about a
 
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
Hundred Acre Farm that'd be a two acre
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
eighty eighty thousand plus square foot
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
building so the two percent we've found
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
in all of our Farmland protection is is
 
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:10.940 align:start position:0%
adequate thank you yep
 
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
and so my question to you is
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
um what is considered agricultural use
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
would we be talking about
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
um well well why don't you explain what
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
what is what kind of buildings are
 
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
considered agricultural use so I realize
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's getting into the weeds a little bit
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and every conservation easement is often
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
drafted a little bit differently but
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with federal funds
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
which is one of the primary reasons
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
we're here so that we can leverage those
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds bring them back to New
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and help us protect some
 
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.289 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and help us protect some
Farmland

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:47.299 align:start position:0%
Farmland
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
each land trust and the U.S department
 
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:52.100 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture decide how to define
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
agriculture most often we defer to the
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
state definition of agriculture
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in front of me but
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone is somewhat familiar
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
with what that definition is
 
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:09.500 align:start position:0%
so any kind of growing of food livestock
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
Horticultural products uh essentially
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
the the growing of agricultural products
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
on the property
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
would that cons would that include Farm
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
stands yes yep yep so if somebody wanted
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
to erect a small building to sell their
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
vegetables or their meat or something
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would be absolutely okay yeah we're
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
really focused you know the Farmland
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
protection has evolved over time as
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby mentioned a lot of
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
these rules are crafted in the 80s and
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
things have changed quite a bit since
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
then Farms have to be more Nimble and in
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
order for them to remain viable they
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
have to do things like a Farm Stand or a
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
farm store to sell their own products
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
directly to Consumers so modern day
 
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:54.860 align:start position:0%
Farmland protection
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
ease conservation easements are designed
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
to allow those types of things
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes so um one
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
um building issue that I could see uh
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
creating a little bit of confusion would
 
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
creating a little bit of confusion would
be

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
um a greenhouse space for uh either the
 
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.570 align:start position:0%
um a greenhouse space for uh either the
um

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know for doing uh Horticultural
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
plants or for doing uh you know starting
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
the plants then I go out to the field or
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
also Hydroponics uh which is a can be a
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
substantial food production uh and it
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
would that sort of building be limited
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
by uh the the types of grants that would
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
be available
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
so you know generally speaking
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
um that two percent and they call it an
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
impervious surface limitation but
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
essentially that's buildings
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
um that that is designed to protect what
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to do with Farmland
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
protection is protect the soils
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
not all soils are created equal and New
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only has a very limited amount
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
of soils that are going to be really
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
good at growing crops uh for to have
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
food for people so we're trying to
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
protect those soils and the two percent
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
limitation is meant to allow for certain
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
types of buildings
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
um like uh
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
you're referencing to grow seedlings to
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
maybe get the crops started we we feel
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
that the two percent limitation is
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
adequate for that type of production if
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's a say a Horticultural operation
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
that is growing everything under a roof
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
and in a very controlled environment
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
they don't really have a need for that
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
important Farmland soil and we would
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
rather focus on farms where we're
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
protecting the soil itself
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
those that are that are growing under
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse or a very controlled
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
environment they can essentially build
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
that Greenhouse wherever they'd like but
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
it it probably shouldn't be on on
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
Farmland important Farmland soils
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative Howard you have a
 
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.110 align:start position:0%
representative Howard you have a
question

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
I just have a question about the handout
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
that you sent that you passed out um is
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
the blue the only new change for in the
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
red is is what we were proposing before
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yeah that that was just a
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
function of word on the day that we put
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
this together
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
um the only change that was
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
um was suggested initially is in 432-24
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
and searching for mine right now under
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me 432 uh 22
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's on the front page
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
under number Roman numeral two
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
that was the initials suggested change
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
and what that really does like I had
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
said before is that allows the state to
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
hold the right of enforcement so
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
essentially These funds would be
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
available for Farmland protection and
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
the state would hold a Perpetual right
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
to enforce the terms of the easement but
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
uniquely and I think uh better suited
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
for the Department
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to be out there every
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
year monitoring these conservation
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
easements which cost money and time and
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
expertise that's something that land
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
trusts already do and we would have to
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
do for all of the work we do with the
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
federal government when we use federal
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
funds so this allows to stay to hold
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
that right of enforcement without having
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
the burden of having to be out there
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
um so the would the land trust Coalition
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
is that is that a state-based Corp um
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
organization yeah the New Hampshire land
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
trust Coalition is is a group of land
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
trusts around the state of New Hampshire
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
only within New Hampshire although some
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
of those actually what I should say is
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
some of those land trusts on the borders
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
like upper Saco Valley land trust or
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley land trusts they do work in
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont or Maine but the Coalition is
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
made up of new hampshire-based land
 
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.510 align:start position:0%
made up of new hampshire-based land
trusts

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
trusts
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby
 
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I'm wondering if we could uh
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
walk through some of the changes that
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
were not in the original bill
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and it looks like on the first page
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh you're suggesting that
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um a member of the land trust Coalition
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh be added to the
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
um to the aop board uh and if you want
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
to speak to that briefly I can just say
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
very quickly you know as I've mentioned
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
um modern land conservation is is very
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
complex and Technical
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
um it's it's something that I think land
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
trusts do for a living and we feel like
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
it would be a very good idea for the
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
state to have a member of the landross
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
community on this board advising
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
particularly you know the the
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh will need to be
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
gone through again they haven't been uh
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
Rewritten since the 80s or 90s so as I
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
go through those administrative rules we
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure or someone from the
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
land trust Community is there and can
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
help ensure that there isn't any
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal funding
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
sources that we're aiming to to use
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
before before we go a little further
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
into the proposed language can you tell
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee a little bit about
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
what are the problems that we're running
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
into now without having this legislation
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
I mean give an example of a of a recent
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
issue that something has happened yeah
 
00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
issue that something has happened yeah
yeah

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
because this is the Departments I think
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm
 
00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:32.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm
better

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
poised to to respond to that okay she
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any knowledge of things
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely all right and I think is
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
because this is the work session we
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
might want to open it up to a little bit
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
more you know rather than a sort of the
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
testimony approach maybe having people
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
who have the the knowledge ship in so
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
maybe the yeah so sure uh commissioner
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
why don't you come up and and just give
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
us a brief explanation of a recent issue
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
that happened that because we don't have
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
changed uh has happened so first of all
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear the department has not
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
purchased any development rights since
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
the 80s
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
since l-chip came into existence there's
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
been no funding for this program so all
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
the Deeds that we hold and there are 84
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
or something like that are all
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
go back many years now
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
recently in one one important issue
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's come up has been the issue of
 
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.850 align:start position:0%
that's come up has been the issue of
solar

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
solar
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and although it doesn't set a
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
precedent I'm very concerned about it
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
and and will probably be
 
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:46.549 align:start position:0%
and and will probably be
um

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps even talking about
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
um some legislature in the future but we
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
hold a
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
development rights to a piece of of
 
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.890 align:start position:0%
development rights to a piece of of
property

00:26:59.890 --> 00:26:59.900 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
where solar panels were placed on our
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
easement without permission
 
00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:07.970 align:start position:0%
easement without permission
now

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
that really limits agricultural
 
00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.010 align:start position:0%
that really limits agricultural
production

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.020 align:start position:0%
production
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
the court found
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
that the production of electricity
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
we decided not to appeal that
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
because of the precedent it could
 
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.390 align:start position:0%
because of the precedent it could
um

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
could make so we probably should be
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
looking at making sure because it's this
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
slippery slope the farm does get credits
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
when they produce too much and there's
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
no way for us to monitor any of that and
 
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
then how do we know you know what
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
happens if they they go out of business
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
and are still producing electricity and
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
just selling it into the grid this is a
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
real slippery slope so that's the most
 
00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:58.430 align:start position:0%
real slippery slope so that's the most
recent

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
recent
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
thing I did have one
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
um several years ago where there's a
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
small piece of land over on the Seacoast
 
00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:07.610 align:start position:0%
small piece of land over on the Seacoast
area

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the owners decided Well it's not
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
suitable for agriculture anymore their
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
excuse was because it's surrounded by
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
too many
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
housing houses well that was the purpose
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
of buying the property and they said and
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
see we're just growing Christmas trees
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
on it and I said okay well that is an
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
agricultural use I'm not calling the
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
committee together
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
our language on extinguishment is really
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
odd land that is no longer suitable for
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural uses how does a land no
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
longer become suitable for agricultural
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
use as well if somebody polluted that a
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
neighbor polluted the land well it's not
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
really it becomes a super fun site I
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
would assume and would have to be
 
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
would assume and would have to be
restored

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
restored
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
so that's a very strange language it's
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
not acceptable
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
to uh to the USDA but
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
really right now there aren't a lot of
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
issues although we do have cleanup
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
issues that we need to deal with but the
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
land the language
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that we currently have is a problem
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
and it would really be problematic going
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
going forward and I would certainly say
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
that even without a change in law on
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
solar panels I would make sure that any
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
deed that we were involved with excluded
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
solar panels from being based on on the
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
ground roofs is fine I mean if you want
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
to put got a parking lot you want to put
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
them above parking lots fine they
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taking agricultural land
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
out of production out of its highest and
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
best use
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:02.769 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:02.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
to all these issues how many of you are
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
what I've learned is that the Alp
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
program that commissioner
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
has funds set aside for it but it's
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
essentially not functioning because it
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
resides within the department of
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
agricultural markets and food which
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the capacity right now to
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
administer it so those funds have not
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
been utilized at all since they become
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
allocated to this program
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
um and so they're just they're just
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
sitting in this change would enable us
 
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:37.220 align:start position:0%
to make use of those thoughts
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
continue to partnership with the theme
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
and so the changes are essential because
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
they make the pro they'll be able to
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
make the program function right now it
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
is not it is not I understand it
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
function and if I if I could further
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and that is in part because realizing
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
um the limitations my original goal was
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
to partner with USDA because we're
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
leaving so much money sitting on the
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
table as I got into this realized that
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to be able to partner
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
with USDA or the land trusts without
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
statutory change how much in dollars
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
would you say is currently I believe I
 
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.630 align:start position:0%
would you say is currently I believe I
have

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
the end of this fiscal year I think it
 
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:28.580 align:start position:0%
was it's like
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
two five million there's another 250 per
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
year in the budget so we will be at 1.75
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
um which will allow us to make an impact
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
but we need these changes to take place
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
to bring all the partners into place and
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
frankly I do not want to see us add more
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
land that we can't properly Monitor and
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff to do that's
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
becoming an issue for all in a lot of
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
places because we keep adding Parcels of
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
land and we've got to figure out the
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring part of it but I don't want
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
to add staff to do that okay thank you
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so that one point
 
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.950 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so that one point
uh

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
1.5 one point to become become 1.7
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
eventually million is money in the
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
department that is not able to be spent
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
right now and that would then be
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
available for a match with USDA funds
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
which means we're leaving another
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
million and a half on the table that we
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
could be bringing into the state to do
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
this but we're not is that correct
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and and if I could I would just add
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
on to that and um my colleague from
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
American Farmland trust could do this
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
but what's important to understand is
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding that's available
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
for this at the federal level is about
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
to dramatically increase so New
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be essentially left in
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
the dust and unable to access those
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
funds unless we tweak this language so
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
Chelsea yeah
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to potentially seeing more
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
money go to the agricultural
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
conservation easement program in the
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
next Farm Bill Congress passed the
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction Act
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
earlier in early 20 or in mid-2022 and
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
that allocated over 20 billion dollars
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
to commemoration programs at USC and RTS
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
including 1.4 billion for the
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
agricultural conservation easement
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
program and so that is money that New
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could leverage if this program
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
is self-running
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
so is it possible for uh money from uh
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
like the Farmland trust or another uh
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
organ uh private organization to be used
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
to leverage those federal funds to
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
increase the amount that we could get
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's something we do with
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
nearly every one of those projects take
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm working on a dairy farm in the
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
town of Greenland New Hampshire
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
um The Smiths own it and um it's a
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
project that l-chips supported but
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
l-chip you know is a very competitive
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
Grant process they only have enough
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
money to fund a few Farmland projects a
 
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.149 align:start position:0%
money to fund a few Farmland projects a
year

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
um I have probably 10 Farmland projects
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
on my desk right now that I'm struggling
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
to find funds for that would be a good
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
fit for this program so we're very land
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
trusts are very Nimble and used to
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
finding funds from lots of different
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
places to make these projects work
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
what's a real challenge in New Hampshire
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a lot of the other New
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
England states is we don't have a
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
dedicated Farmland protection fund other
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
states do that and they're protecting a
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
if um if this passes would the land
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
trust be able to take over monitoring
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
the exist the lands already held by the
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
department of existing I believe the way
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
the statute reads is they can delegate
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
that to another organization and that
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
would really be up to the department
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
that's not something we'd necessarily
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
advocate for but we are we already have
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
easement monitors on staff they're
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
skilled at doing that and that's
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
something the department could certainly
 
00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.390 align:start position:0%
something the department could certainly
consider

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative smart
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
so if the if the property is already in
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
a conservation easement and then this we
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
and this bill passes
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
how how is our is the existing
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
conservation easement already like does
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
the state come in and say okay now we're
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
in charge or how does that work no so
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the existing ones we are in charge
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
nothing will change for the existing
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
ones okay if in the future there was a
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
decision to farm out the monitoring that
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
would be totally different issue yeah we
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
really should be focusing on on
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
this this bill and what the language
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
allows us to do which is to allow us to
 
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:11.780 align:start position:0%
Simply to partner with the land trust
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
and the USDA we could still on our own
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
purchase Deeds strictly on on the terms
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
so we would not necessarily you know
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're not giving up our ability to do
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
anything this is an expansion of our
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
ability to access other other funds
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
which all along I thought we could
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
access USDA funds and then that's become
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
clear that without at least that part of
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
the change we can't do
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
can't do that because they are not they
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
are not okay with our extinguishment
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
clause in there and will not participate
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
without the language change that is
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
being proposed you know in uh
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
in 432-24
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
. so I am in full support of all of the
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
language here you know things have been
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
moving crazy I wish we'd gotten to the
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
point where this had been all done
 
00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
point where this had been all done
before

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
um we had to have it drafted
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's been too many
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
things uh moving and so a strong support
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
of this but please just
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know understand that all we are
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
doing here you know adding the land
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
trust Coalition I think that's important
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
right now the executive director of
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
l-chip is on the board as a public
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
member I think that's important I think
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
this will be a a key piece as well
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
um but this is just giving us more
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
opportunities it's not giving up any
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
rights that we have it's not giving up
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
any rights to what we hold and it
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop us from doing what we used
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
to do if there was the right
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
circumstance but you know the leveraging
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the money is critical for this I
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have come in and asked to
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
refund this if if there wasn't the
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
possibility to match funds
 
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
possibility to match funds
representative

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being here
 
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.250 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being here
um

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
one well I have a couple of questions uh
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
one uh because we'll be partnering with
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
the USDA are there any strings going to
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
no no not to the best of my knowledge
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
other than they would have if we were to
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
release and again I can't see any any
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that would happen
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
where that would be advantageous to to
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
release those but that's the only thing
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
um obviously they're going to decide
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
whether they want to participate in a
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
particular project
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know in in terms of string our goals
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
are all the same to preserve farmland
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
Representatives come to a follow-up
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and my my other question is is
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
um you know I agree with you that if
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to put land into
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
you know a trust or whatever for
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes that solar should
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
be excluded from that I agree hardly
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're in here would we where would you
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
put that into language
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
that would be in the Deeds that every
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
deed is different you can't have because
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
each Farm is going to be different and
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
what they do and what the requirements
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
of the farm are going to be different so
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
the deed language doesn't belong in in
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
statute except for
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the particulars that are already there
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's not what we're we're
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
talking about so I wasn't prepared to
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
talk about those those things but
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
things can be excluded or included in
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
the deed as long as they meet the
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements thank you yeah
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
and just to tag on to that
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
um when I mentioned that land trusts
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
used several different funding sources
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
to conserve Farmland
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
um again the the Greenland dairy farm
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
for example we're using l-chip funds
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
we're also using drinking water trust
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
fund funding from the New Hampshire
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
each of those grant funding sources have
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
their own little set of restrictions
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
that you know the drinking water
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
restricts uh you know make sure that the
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
agriculture that's happening on site is
 
00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:29.099 align:start position:0%
safe and will not disrupt the drinking
 
00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:30.410 align:start position:0%
safe and will not disrupt the drinking
water

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so the the statute isn't really a
 
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
place to have uh specific
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
elements of the deed listed that's
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
something that comes together based on
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
every project thank you
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
and my question is typically
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me typically
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
um how is the funding used does the
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
person who owns the land the you know
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
the they get the fun the grant money to
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
do something with it how is that how
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
does that work yeah I can I can describe
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
that so uh the basic processes will do
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
an appraisal of the property that's
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
going to go into a conservation easement
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh what let's just say that appraisal
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
determines the conservation easement's
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
value is a million dollars
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
the land trust negotiates with the
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
landowner to determine a set value it
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
might be a million or the landowner
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
might be generous and say I'll take five
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand so that 500 000 would
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
go to the landowner and again Lynn
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
trusts are pulling that 500 money from
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
several different funding sources
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
including the federal government uh the
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the program that we're talking about the
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
federal government brings 50 of that
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
value to the table
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
so it may be a situation where let's
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
take that same situation the easement's
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
worth a million dollars the federal
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
government provides 500 000 and the
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
landowner says they'll take 600 000.
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
that means we only need to find one
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars somewhere else
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
to make that project fly so it's it's
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
not even it can be up to a one-to-one
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
match but it can actually be much more
 
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:07.220 align:start position:0%
favorable that the state could provide
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh five percent of of that uh payment so
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
every property is different has a
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
different value and it just depends on
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
how it's negotiated in in terms of
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
what the uses of the funds are that is
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
money that is strictly goes to the land
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
holder and they can do whatever they
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
want in many cases I've seen that it's
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
used to pay down debt to to allow the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
farm to become viable but there's the
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
option of people have somebody who's
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
going to be the successor to that farm
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
this money gives the current
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
operators their retirement fund their
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to to pass that on to
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the next generation and not have to rely
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
on an income stream from the operation
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
so it's whatever they want to do with
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
the funds that's not something I've ever
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
seen that there's restrictions on that
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are others that may purchase more
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
more property with uh with the funds and
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it's a one-time thing
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
um you know these landowners these
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
Farmers they only have one chance to
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
cash in that Equity that development
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
potential of the property so once that
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
transaction has passed
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
um the land is protected forever
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
um you know and we've done our job
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things one is just just
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
to be clear what the
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
um what the landowner is selling is the
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
right to uh do any sort of development
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
that is not consistent with agriculture
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
or for instance building houses or
 
00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:48.020 align:start position:0%
building you know factories or whatever
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
and they so that is a value that is part
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
of their land ownership that they have
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
chosen to sell and by selling that and
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
putting a deed restriction on it they
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
that deed says this gland can't be used
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
for anything other than agriculture so
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
is that a fair description that's a
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
really simple way of describing it okay
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of questions about
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
um how this works in the language that
 
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
um how this works in the language that
you've

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
you've
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the the additional language you
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
suggested in 3224
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh when you have the phrase you've
 
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
inserted in several places the state's
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
interest in and
 
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:37.220 align:start position:0%
um how does that
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
uh oh well first of all if you see the
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
word extinguishment clause a number of
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
times and the term extinguishment Clause
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
never actually appears in the in in the
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
in in the language although that's
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
probably a lawyer's description of what
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
this Clause is yes
 
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.089 align:start position:0%
this Clause is yes
so

00:44:55.089 --> 00:44:55.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
could you explain what that is and then
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
how the language changes here make that
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
um not a problem yes yes yeah so
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner used the term
 
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.770 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner used the term
extinguishment

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
extinguishment
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
um in the statute it's called release
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
and that's what section 24 is all about
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
so essentially
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
um under the under the old program the
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
rules written in the 1980s uh farmer
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
landowner could go to the committee and
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
say this land is no longer useful for
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
agricultural purposes and if the
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee agreed they would release the
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
conservation easement on the land and
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
the farmer would be able to do as they
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
please with that land again and and
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
that's what the commissioner was
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
referencing with respect to one of those
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
examples he provided
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
um that that may be the way they did
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
land conservation in the 80s but
 
00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:51.410 align:start position:0%
land conservation in the 80s but
nowadays

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
nowadays
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
we think of perpetuity these
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
conservation easements as forever and
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
the only
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
examples of when you'd be able to
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
release or extinguish a conservation
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
easement is in an extreme circumstance
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh eminent domain which essentially
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
trumps every other property right uh we
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
understand that that may be a case or uh
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner referenced a huge chemical
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
spill or some kind of hazardous waste
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
everyone all of the interest holders of
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
that conservation easement agree you
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
will never be able to grow any food on
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
that property again then uh through a
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
Judicial proceeding that conservation
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
easement could be extinguished
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it's only under very extreme
 
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances that a Perpetual
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
conservation easement would ever be
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
extinguished so what we're doing here
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
with this release language is rather
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
than that leaving that decision up to a
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
committee is something that all of the
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
interest holders of the conservation
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
evening would have to agree to
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
and so the reference to the state's
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
interest back in the 1980s the state was
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
the only one holding these conservation
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
easements so this release language
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
described the process
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
now if we're going to be using federal
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
or other funding sources for this there
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
will be other interest folders involved
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
so this release language is is being
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
tweaked so that it just describes the
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
state's procedure for releasing but
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
won't enforce the way the other interest
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
holders would be able to extinguish the
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
easement and that's a requirement by
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
USDA they would never enter into a
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
conservation easement that only the
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
state could extinguish and and I think
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
if I may that first Red Line
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
um in 432-24 and as may be further set
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
forth in the terms of the deed that's
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
where those release terms would be set
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
out for for the others that that
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
language is uh were really I think sets
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
the table for that and then it just
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
changes it so we have an interest and I
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
will say that
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
um to the very best of my knowledge
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
there has never been a release of
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
development rights by this by the state
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that has not happened
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
that I have found anywhere
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I would just add to bring it even
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
closer to home that dairy farm example
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
where we're using drinking water trust
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
fund dollars
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
if we were to match those dollars with
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
Alp right now
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
the state looking at the interest that
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
holds wouldn't allow this release
 
00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:40.730 align:start position:0%
holds wouldn't allow this release
language

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
so even when we're using New Hampshire
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
state-based funding we wouldn't be able
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
to match it using this existing language
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so uh so if there's
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
USDA funding for
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a USDA match than the USDA is
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
one of those interest holders correct as
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
and then if there's also say farmland
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
trust money they'd be another one and so
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
you could conceivably have you know
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
three or four different interest holders
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
on a given uh on deed restriction that's
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
correct and and the way this is now
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
written is each of those interest
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
holders would be able to declare and
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
describe how they would handle and
 
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.309 align:start position:0%
describe how they would handle and
extinguishment

00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
extinguishment
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's what this additional language
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
allows for thank you
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
and that's something that the landowner
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
would be aware of absolutely when they
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
when they uh agree to
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
um to this deed correct yeah so when
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
land trusts make an agreement with a
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
landowner it looks like a purchasing
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
sale agreement much like you would you
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
know when you're purchasing a home and
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
in that we stipulate exactly what the
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
deed language will look like for the the
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
Farmland conservation deed
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
would this make it easier or more
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
difficult for the landowner
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
at such a time where they decide they
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
want to sell their property
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a really good question I mean
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
obviously it would be easier for a
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
landowner to sell at least in my neck of
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
the woods on the Seacoast to sell a
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hundred Acre Farm to a developer this
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that so I guess in that
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
sense it may make it harder to sell that
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
property but again you know we're using
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
Public Funding to ensure that we have
 
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
some Farmland protected for the future
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I would argue that it's in the
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of the public to have some of
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
that land protected and while it may
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit more restrictive
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
for the landowner selling that property
 
00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:49.579 align:start position:0%
I think that's the goal of this program
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
and if I may I don't I don't think that
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
anybody who's selling their development
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
rights the owners at the time are
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
thinking oh well in the future I'm going
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to get this back that's
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's not part of their thought process
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
now the next people who buy it may want
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out how to get it back
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
they're not the ones who benefited from
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
from the sale
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you there's just no you have a
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
comment back there I'm sorry what's your
 
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.690 align:start position:0%
comment back there I'm sorry what's your
name

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:28.250 align:start position:0%
name
Nicole

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
it's easier or harder to sell the
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
participation under conservation even
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
changes your options as a landowner but
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
it is changes are neutral as I
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
understand it in terms of how it impacts
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
a way of doing the options
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would also add
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
conservation easements are entirely
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
voluntary there is no one out there
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's being forced to do a conservation
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
easement it's entirely their own choice
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I was just noticing that we're
 
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
changing the number of uh voting members
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
to eight normally on a board
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it's usually an odd number just
 
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.170 align:start position:0%
um it's usually an odd number just
because

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so I was just wondering about that we
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
were talking about that on the walk over
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
and I think we'd be entirely open to
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
adjusting that I think our intent is to
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's someone from the
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
land trust Community or the land trust
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
Coalition that can help advise that
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
board so however you decide to
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
fit that interest in
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
if I if I may
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you know and I know that's done
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
because I was to avoid a tie vote
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think the likelihood of that happening
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
is is so remote is you know I would
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
rather not drop somebody off else often
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
and to just add somebody arbitrarily to
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
get to
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know a uh an odd number I don't
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
think has any any value
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
you could also add two members from the
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
there any other questions that the
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee might have about
 
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.730 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee might have about
this

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby yes uh you you
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
um mentioned the fact that there might
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
need to be rulemaking to bring the uh
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
this back up into the
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
um current decade uh and uh is that some
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
and so would having the land trust board
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
on a member on the board uh would that
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
would is the board involved in rule
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
making or well I guess would they be
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
involved because I guess this is a
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
prospective thing so this hasn't
 
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:47.300 align:start position:0%
happened for decades
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
I I am involving everyone that I can in
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
in getting the comments on this and of
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
course there uh is a public comment I
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
don't think the advisory committee
 
00:53:58.859 --> 00:53:59.630 align:start position:0%
don't think the advisory committee
um

00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
or has has a formal role in that but
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
certainly they will they will see it and
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping to to start with that rule
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
making process very soon I'll be quite
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
Frank with you
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
um rulemaking is the most difficult
 
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.130 align:start position:0%
um rulemaking is the most difficult
thing

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
um that I have come across and trying to
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
to uh to deal with the rules is is not
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
something that I'm comfortable with we
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
are in the process
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
of um hiring a part-time person who will
 
00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:35.300 align:start position:0%
be doing our rulemaking and our
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
administrative judicial process
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that's about to close out and so I
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
should have somebody on board very
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
shortly and then we're going to be
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
starting with the rule making process
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
great so and you so you already have the
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
funding for that position we do great
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
uh is anybody else on the subcommittee
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
have any comments or questions about
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
this uh proposal
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I just like to say that I think that
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
what we have here for language looks
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
like it's what's going to work and I'd
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to draft an amendment to bring
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
to the executive section and whatever
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks whenever we get to it
 
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.210 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks whenever we get to it
okay

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so we have
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
time to put a little work into doing
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
that and I'm amenable to that
 
00:55:32.099 --> 00:55:38.510 align:start position:0%
that and I'm amenable to that
no

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I think we've kind of exhausted all
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
of our uh our questions and
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
on this particular Bill I'm glad we uh
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
we did get together because uh
 
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.290 align:start position:0%
we did get together because uh
apparently

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:53.300 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
this this didn't need a little bit more
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
work and consideration for other parties
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh and other language so this was good
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions from the
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if none I'm going to close
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
out this subcommittee work session and
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
we'll take a little bit break and then
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
come back at 10 o'clock
 
00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:18.470 align:start position:0%
come back at 10 o'clock
for

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%

HB 326 rodenticide bill so
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
let's take a little a little break see
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%

01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
okay I would ask that our committee
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:49.569 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:49.569 --> 01:04:49.579 align:start position:0%

and I invite um
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper to say a few words
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
to our committee regarding some new
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
information on this
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
issue yes thank you madam chairman
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I'm still
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
here in hopes that you will find the
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
bill in Expedia to legislate and I hope
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
to be giving you the reasons why why you
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
should do that we heard the testimony at
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing loud and clear heard what
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
was being asked for and as luck would
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
have it the pesticides board was meeting
 
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.309 align:start position:0%
have it the pesticides board was meeting
yesterday

01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
um and this was on our agenda and so
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just read you the memo here and I
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
apologize for running out of time and
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
not getting it to you all in advance at
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
its February 20 February 6 2023 meeting
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire pesticide control
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
board uh motion to establish a work
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
group to review the concerns of Road
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
denticides residue in Wildlife the work
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
group is to include representatives of
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire licensed pesticide
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Audubon
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
so I think we have
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
done what everyone was hoping would
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately happen here we have a
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
ultimately happen here we have a
preliminary

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
preliminary
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
report date of August 1st recognizing
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
there may be something that would need
 
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:50.180 align:start position:0%
to be introduced for legislation
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
may not be enough time to to finish but
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's the target at the um
 
01:06:59.650 --> 01:06:59.660 align:start position:0%
at the present time and certainly the
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
representatives representative of the
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
Audubon Society was present and we have
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
names from the other associations we'll
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
be reaching out to and establishes
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
director Russo has been tasked with
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
putting this
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
committee to together and getting to
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
work as soon as possible
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes I have a couple
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
of questions uh one is that we had
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
discussed uh in the committee uh early
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
some of us in the committee had
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
discussed the possibility of writing a
 
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
letter to the board asking them to do
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
this it sounds like they have already
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
done this so uh would such a letter be
 
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
redundant or should we say send a letter
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
saying thank you for doing this thank
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
you for doing this would be appropriate
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
because we have we have done it because
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
we did hear what what was going on and
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
we share the concerns about what's
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
what's happening uh and we want to
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can deal with this we
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
do think a lot of it needs to be solved
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
at the federal level by not allowing
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
homeowners to purchase this stuff in in
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
bulk or even in containers where they
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
can just throw handfuls of it all over
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
the place I think that's a large issue
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
and the FEDS are working on that but um
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
we will get into this more and figure
 
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
out what we can and representative and
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is uh you had suggested an
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
itl and I'm thinking but mentioned that
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
when the results come out was did you
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
say August 1st
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's hopeful some people think that
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
may be too aggressive
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
by by next fall yes um so if we were to
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
retain the bill in order to have a tool
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
if there is something that the board
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
feels they need legislatively do you
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
think that would be a better uh option
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
than it yelling it
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
I I I I suppose I mean you have the
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
option of putting a
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
a bill in in the fall anyhow so I right
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
I I guess that one of the issues that
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes comes up is that if the new
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
bill were deemed to be too close to the
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
old bill
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
the rules committee could say oh you
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
can't put that in yeah so there is
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
certainly no harm in retaining it thank
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker representative Creighton
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you commissioner thank you
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
um that's good news expected
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
um that uh on the 21st of August the
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
report will come back from this work
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
group could you sort of highlight what
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
you expect from that report is it is
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
that a definitive you know this will be
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
I mean what kind of result would you
 
01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:41.420 align:start position:0%
expect from that I would expect perhaps
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations as to
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
changes to our rules or changes to the
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
laws or perhaps and and perhaps
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
um recommendations that we make a
 
01:09:58.209 --> 01:09:58.219 align:start position:0%
a send a letter to our Congressional
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
Delegation asking them to pursue changes
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
on a federal level if the feds have not
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
acted because these
 
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.850 align:start position:0%
acted because these
um

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
these type of products
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
should be restricted in my opinion to
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
license applicators or in small
 
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
containers which are sealed that birds
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
and other type of non-target wildlife
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
can't get in into that's not currently
 
01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:32.060 align:start position:0%
the case as
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
director Russo indicated
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
um I think here and then again yesterday
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
in some places on the internet a
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner could buy a five gallon pail
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
of this stuff
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
and just spread it everywhere which is
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know god-awful so but we can't
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
control that because
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
we only can control what is physically
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
sold in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
people who are buying things on the
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
internet there's nothing we can do about
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
that uh and that is that I think is
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
likely to end up being
 
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:07.970 align:start position:0%
likely to end up being
um

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
the final solution to this problem
 
01:11:12.649 --> 01:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
although I am suggesting we can probably
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
do more to restrict in-state sales as
 
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
do more to restrict in-state sales as
well

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up and and so okay excellent
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
the the one question I have is in your
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
opinion your estimation what's the
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
chance that that work group would kick
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
the can down the road for further study
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
I am pretty sure given some of the
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
people that we've put on here that
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have the desire to
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
do that I think the Audubon Society
 
01:11:45.729 --> 01:11:45.739 align:start position:0%
representative in the in the uh animal
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate wildlife rehabilitators in
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
particular are going to want to get to a
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
solution on this quickly and I can tell
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
you I don't want to kick it down the
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
road I want to see us come up with some
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
solid recommendations
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
um by the end of certainly by the end of
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
August sooner if possible
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
um but I do know that
 
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:09.380 align:start position:0%
the feds have the biggest
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
role to play in in solving this this
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
concern thank you sir
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am uh representative Murray
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you commissioner just
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
to clarify for the record are you saying
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is zero oversight that you have on
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
anything coming online any online
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
purchases this is this is the problem
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
with anything that is sold on the
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
internet whether it be pet food or you
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
name it
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority to you know
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
we can reach out at times
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
if we know who the companies are and try
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
to get them to not sell in the state if
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
it is a violation or anything but you
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
know our ability to actually enforce
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything on a company that may be based
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
in California in just selling online to
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
anybody is essentially nil
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative NAB
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question it seemed like in the
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard there was a gap in
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
the actual data collection as to what
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
was happening is there a thought as to
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
how that's going to be addressed well I
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
think that is the purpose of bringing
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
all these people together because it
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
became obvious that the Diagnostic lab
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
had told people something that we hadn't
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
been told in in the rehabilitators and
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Audubon Society had information that
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
so there is a problem in Communications
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
this working group will ensure that all
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
those parties come together and that
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're sharing all the same information
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then we can look at it in the same
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
manner that's something that hasn't
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
happened and frankly you know this
 
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.169 align:start position:0%
happened and frankly you know this
really

01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
until last summer was something that I
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
had never heard of as a concern we
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
immediately went to work on it and that
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
one particular situation we dealt with
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
now it's obvious there are other other
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
concerns which we were not aware of
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh and um I have a question as to um
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
are we in touch with what kind of
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
studies the EPA is doing on these uh
 
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.110 align:start position:0%
studies the EPA is doing on these uh
substances

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
substances
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
no but I'm sure that this working group
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
will will be interested in that and and
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
reaching out I mean again fish and game
 
01:14:31.739 --> 01:14:32.930 align:start position:0%
reaching out I mean again fish and game
maybe

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not so I don't know who knows what
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this group together will give
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
us the best information and I'm sure
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
that there will be Outreach to to
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal agencies do you know when they
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
have plans to meet next we got to get
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee together I've tasked David
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
with David Russo of doing that as as
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
soon as possible so I'm hopeful by the
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
end of the month we will have a working
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
group together and have a meeting
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled thank you uh representative
 
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
scheduled thank you uh representative
datsey

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
datsey
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh will these
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee meetings be open to the public
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
and will the public be able to comment
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question and generally
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
I would I would say yes we and I think
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's a good point we can advertise
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
um these meetings on our website and on
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
I represent Bixby
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
getting back to the ability to make
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
something restricted use
 
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.390 align:start position:0%
something restricted use
um

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
I a couple of questions on that one is
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh does the
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
um do we as a state have the ability to
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
restrict things more uh more strongly
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that we do okay and I I don't
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to give you a definitive on that I
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
wish David were here to answer that
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
question but my understanding is we do
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up sure so um I uh
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
I notice sometimes when I'm reading a
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
um uh agricultural products catalog uh
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
that uh they'll they'll be on underneath
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
some products not uh not allowed for
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
sale in such and such and such and such
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
so for instance if you're buying current
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
plants it says not allowed for shipment
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire uh so uh it seems like
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is some capacity to say no you
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
can't sell that to us uh and I would
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
guess that you if you're talk if you
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
there might be companies like gemplers
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
which is pretty good about paying
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
attention to what state laws are that
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
will have that caveat and there might be
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
other ones that are sloppier but uh
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
there it seems like at least we could uh
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
reduce it if we had a further
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
restriction I agree the responsible
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
company will put that restriction in
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
place and I should also clarify that
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
once the product comes in if we find
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who is applying it against the
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
law we can take enforcement action
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
against the individual
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't exempt them from having
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
to comply with the laws once they get it
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
but but you're absolutely right there
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
are companies but unfortunately you know
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
in in the area of plant industry we get
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of plant dealers who are
 
01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.470 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of plant dealers who are
shipping

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
plants into
 
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
the state that I restricted and they
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
should know that they should be aware of
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
that as should
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
the person who's selling it on retail in
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
the state but people don't all always
 
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
are only there to keep the honest
 
01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.530 align:start position:0%
are only there to keep the honest
honesty

01:17:59.530 --> 01:17:59.540 align:start position:0%
honesty
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
um I've I lost track a little bit of the
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill this is actually question made more
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
for the committee are we talking about a
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
restriction or a ban
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
the current bill
 
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh requests a ban on that particular
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
substance or a couple of different
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
apparently this working group will get
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're having and how to
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
best solve it not so not necessarily
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill but the issue itself
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah sure um so uh we we would we
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
would entertain the idea of a
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
restriction or restricting it to Prof
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
pesticide or or debt decide
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
professionals would that would that be
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we could make
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh if we retain the bill we would have a
 
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:02.060 align:start position:0%
choice down the road of either
 
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:05.060 align:start position:0%
italing the bill or
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
passing it the way it is I imagine
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:16.699 align:start position:0%
there are several several different
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
methods of action that we can take as a
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
committee one is to pass legislation
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
another is to make to recommend to a an
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
existing body that they do a job which
 
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
they are currently empowered to do so in
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
this case the pesticide board is
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
currently empowered to investigate this
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and uh there I believe
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
that director Russo testified that they
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
do have the capacity to make uh certain
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
substances restricted use within the
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so if the
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
pesticide board has the power to do that
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
completely then we wouldn't need to do
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
anything with the bill because they
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
could make it restricted use uh if they
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh if there's some piece of power that
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
they need in order further power from
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature that in the in order to
 
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
be able to do that then
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
one of our options would be to if we
 
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
retain the bill we could then amend it
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
to give them whatever power they need to
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh to to take further action uh so and
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
another thing that we can do is we can
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
just you know make a bill and say do
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
this and uh the department will be
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
required to do it but they might not do
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
it very well because we didn't we
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
weren't being cooperative with them and
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
you they have lots of things on their
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
agenda and you know that might not be
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
the top of their list so it always makes
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
sense to try to cooperate with the
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
Departments as much as possible because
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are actually
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
executing what we write as loss
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative kantois thank you madam
 
01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.209 align:start position:0%
representative kantois thank you madam
chair

01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so it is true that
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
um the director can put restrictive uses
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
on products even if they are legal
 
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.250 align:start position:0%
on products even if they are legal
federally

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
federally
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
um the governor is also very aware of
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
this uh bit uh
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
particular pesticide this rodenticide
 
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
particular pesticide this rodenticide
and

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
has put it as one of his top priorities
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
I think that letting the pesticide
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
control board
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
and the working group do their job
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
is the way to go I would refer to itl
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
this and in the fall come back with
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
something based on the recommendations
 
01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
of the working group if we need to do
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything legislatively
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so yeah representative one one
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
advantage of doing it is retaining it as
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:13.820 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
having it as new legislation is that if
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
we retain it then it can we can get it
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
out a little bit faster in January
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
although uh rather than having a hearing
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
that we we would need to you know we we
 
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
need to have a public hearing then we
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
would need to have it voted on by the
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
four then we would have to have it go
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
over the Senate that process could be
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
moved up by a couple of months because
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bills that we have retained we have
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
votes on immediately in January and then
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
they go straight over to the Senate so
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
it could save a couple of months if we
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh have a retained bill that we can work
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
with and it doesn't really make a
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
difference in turn if if we decide in
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
the fall if the if the board says in the
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
fall we don't need anything we can just
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
itl it in the fall
 
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:09.410 align:start position:0%
itl it in the fall
foreign

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
any other further questions comments
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the commissioner
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
can I just ask you one question I'm
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
sorry this has been kind of like roaming
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
around in my head
 
01:23:39.179 --> 01:23:40.130 align:start position:0%
around in my head
um

01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm concerned about the fact
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
board the pesticide control board is
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
moving forward on this now okay when
 
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.090 align:start position:0%
moving forward on this now okay when
this

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
this look this bill has been filed and
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
apparently they didn't see it as a high
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
enough priority before this so my my
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
concern okay so that's we haven't met
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
since May
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
and this is our first meeting since May
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
so this has not been something
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
that we would have had the opportunity
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
to discuss because it became an issue
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
after May
 
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:22.580 align:start position:0%
follow up follow-up
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
and I've been following the schedule and
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
that's my and and that's my concern okay
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
because I've seen a lot of the meetings
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that get canceled frankly I saw the
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
meeting in January that was canceled and
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
I was amazed to find out that it was
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
rescheduled in February because I
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
thought it was just going to go into
 
01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
thought it was just going to go into
April

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
April
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
so so I I do have some concerns that if
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
we don't take action in this committee
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
um that it's just going to be it's
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's going to be another cancellation
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
and another cancellation and it's never
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to get done well so
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
first of all the pesticides control
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
board only meets when needed
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
and we were scheduled to to meet because
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
we have we're in the rule making process
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
on three sets of rules
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but this has become a obviously a hot
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
button issue so it was on there the
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
board doesn't need to meet
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with this because of the fact
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we formed the working group and
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
that working group
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
is going to get to work and can meet as
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
many times this is not something where
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
the whole pesticides board control board
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
will be called together this working
 
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.189 align:start position:0%
will be called together this working
group

01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
will move right along I am calling you
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
know I will call and preside over the
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
first meeting
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
but as I've as I've told the control
 
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
board I'm doing that to get it organized
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
and to elect a chairman because what I
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually know scientifically about this
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
stuff you couldn't fill a thimble with I
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
expect to learn a lot more in the
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
process but I'm not the right person to
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
be chairing this particular committee we
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
need people on here who really know what
 
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing I will continue to
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
monitor their process progress and make
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure that they are meeting on a regular
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
basis uh and getting at least back to uh
 
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
back to the control board in August we
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
are as you know
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet again in April which I
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
suspect has
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
a lot to do with the rule making process
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to get a lot of these
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
committees together because
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know as you've seen we can have a
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
problem with the Quorum so we have to
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a purpose to get together because
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
if we just call a meeting because oh
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
well it's been four or five months let's
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a meeting we're not going to have a
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
quorum so
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
I would just say that I think
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty's Point speaks to
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
why you would retain it in committee
 
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
because you know I believe there's a
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
process in place here and we should
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
allow that process to play out it gives
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
us some oversight into making sure that
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
it plays out right if we retain in
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee if we feel like next year
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
nothing's or in 11 months nothing's
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
really happened we can revisit this
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but it you know I think the
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's process has responded to
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
many of our concerns and I feel like
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're they're in a good place
 
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.490 align:start position:0%
they're they're in a good place
nope

01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative question no okay
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else have any comments
 
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.030 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else have any comments
questions

01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.729 --> 01:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir uh commissioner for
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
coming in and uh
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
placing your comments and we look
 
01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:34.940 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing further from the
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
pesticide control board
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
and we will be writing a letter to uh
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
would it make sense for me to direct my
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
letter to director Russo who can then
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
pass it off to the uh board or should I
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay so I will direct the letter to you
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
and it will essentially say uh thank you
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
for convening this uh study this uh work
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
group and uh we hope that you will come
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
this committee work session
 
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
and we'll take some time for our
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
individual caucuses to discuss this as
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
we come back at 10 45 to exec this bill
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I did not touch base with the office
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that 403 is available but
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
it probably is so with Mr Democrats
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
let's go up to 403 and if we don't find
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
if we need to figure out something else
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
we'll figure it out okay and I'm going
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
to ask uh our folks in the audience
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
please to leave the room so that we will
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
have some time for our caucus to discuss
 
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:18.410 align:start position:0%

this

01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:18.420 align:start position:0%

the use of second generation
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
anticoagulant rodenticides
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%

um so with this HB 326 do I hear a
 
01:50:17.639 --> 01:50:19.910 align:start position:0%
um so with this HB 326 do I hear a
motion

01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton you're
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
Americanized I remember I moved that we
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
retain HB 326
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
do I hear a second
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray seconds that
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
God yes ma'am I would
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
so uh committee heard testimony from
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
um bull State and private Audubon uh
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
animal Rehabilitation and the issues
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
truly compelling especially when you
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
look at the impact of the uh
 
01:50:58.570 --> 01:50:58.580 align:start position:0%
the chemicals on
 
01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.669 align:start position:0%
the chemicals on
Wildlife

01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
Wildlife
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
Raptors and foxes and and other things
 
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
we also heard the impact of not
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
addressing the rodent issues especially
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
in in homes with testimony about rats
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and baby cribs and those types of things
 
01:51:20.689 --> 01:51:20.699 align:start position:0%
so clearly very compelling arguments on
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
um the the fact that
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
we are charged with protecting wildlife
 
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we're also charged
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
with protecting our own families against
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
the diseases and and other things from
 
01:51:34.619 --> 01:51:36.590 align:start position:0%
the diseases and and other things from
rodents

01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
rodents
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
um as a committee we also heard
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this morning from the
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner that pesticides commission
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
has designated a work group that work
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
group has been charged with uh coming up
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
with very specific recommendations uh
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
which could range from restriction to
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
Banning to letters to the EPA in federal
 
01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
Banning to letters to the EPA in federal
agencies

01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:05.900 align:start position:0%
um that that would address this issue
 
01:52:10.129 --> 01:52:10.139 align:start position:0%
from my perspective uh the work group
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
should be given the opportunity to do
 
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:14.780 align:start position:0%
their job as they've been tasked to do
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
they've been directed to include the
 
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
Audubon Society they've been and as well
 
01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.149 align:start position:0%
Audubon Society they've been and as well
as

01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation folks uh in that in that
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
working group which was requested at the
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard and so I
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that we retain this in order
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the commission and the
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
working group knows that we think it's a
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
very important issue that should be
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
resolved as quickly as possible and that
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
we do not want this to be pushed down
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
the road but that we do want some
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
definitive recommendations based on
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
evidence and study as they suggested by
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
the end of August so for those reason
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
ma'am I recommend we retain this Bill
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes I concur with
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton I would also
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
like to say that the working group will
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do all of that
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
in-depth work that we as a subcommittee
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
heard uh in or excuse me as a full
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
committee heard in testimony and again
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
heard uh here in the subcommittee work
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
group I also think it's important to
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
note that we will be issuing a letter to
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that will sort of State
 
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
our position as far as we're happy to
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
see that this is finally convening and
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
additionally we believe that should the
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
working group then have any
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations out of it they will then
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
report back to us and I believe it's um
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
just for clarification August 1st
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully not the end of August is that
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
correct uh yeah August 1st okay yeah
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and so then and hopefully in
 
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
August then we'll have some clear
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
Direction and if we need to use this as
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
a tool to do so we have it thank you any
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I'd just like
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
to um mention uh sort of emphasize that
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
if the working group if that working
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
group uh realizes that they need
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
something that's a legislative solution
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
the having it available as a retained
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
bill will be the most efficient tool to
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh help them out with that
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh just from my own
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
personal comment I believe that the bill
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
written as it is
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:23.330 align:start position:0%
is not
um

01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
is not a preferable
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
way to go uh I think the bill currently
 
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:32.300 align:start position:0%
written is is not a good bill I wouldn't
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
vote to pass that but I agree with you
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
that if we retain this and
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of legislative need
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
from the working group that will be
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
working on it that we will have a
 
01:54:48.970 --> 01:54:48.980 align:start position:0%
vehicle in which to insert language to
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%

01:54:54.719 --> 01:54:56.750 align:start position:0%

this

hearing this afternoon with the Pledge
 
03:05:23.090 --> 03:05:23.100 align:start position:0%

03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
earlier today to do this so
 
03:05:27.230 --> 03:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
would you please lead us uh

um with hb231 FN prohibiting the removal
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
of Claws from cats
 
03:06:01.309 --> 03:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
and I call to introduce this bill uh
 
03:06:11.389 --> 03:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.370 --> 03:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm here to introduce
 
03:06:18.610 --> 03:06:18.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 231 this bill will make
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic decoring of cats illegal
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it does
 
03:06:26.650 --> 03:06:26.660 align:start position:0%
have exceptions for therapeutic reasons
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of States counties
 
03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:31.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of States counties
cities

03:06:31.630 --> 03:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
cities
 
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
numerous countries have already began
 
03:06:39.050 --> 03:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
Banning the cruel declaring of cats for
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
too long the chlorine has been treated
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
as a routine Veterinary procedure
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
even though it is an elective and
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic surgery meaning it has
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
no medical benefit to the cat it is
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
largely performed to prevent scratching
 
03:06:55.250 --> 03:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
on furniture now I gave somebody an
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
example earlier today if your child
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
writes on the wall in crayon you don't
 
03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
go and amputate the child's finger there
 
03:07:03.769 --> 03:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
are other ways we can prevent cats from
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
scratching Furniture also
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I know I have two cats myself I have
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
two large dogs
 
03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:11.870 align:start position:0%
two large dogs
um

03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
if my cat is scratching the furniture
 
03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
guess what I buy cheaper Furniture I buy
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
a couch cover I make accommodations for
 
03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
the cat you get a scratching post with
 
03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:22.969 align:start position:0%
the cat you get a scratching post with
catnip

03:07:22.969 --> 03:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
catnip
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
um the chlorine is actually amputation
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
it is the amputation of the last bone of
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
each toe on that animal now that's the
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent to cutting off your finger up
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the first knuckle so again we don't
 
03:07:38.090 --> 03:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
do that to our children for drawing with
 
03:07:40.250 --> 03:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
crayons on the wall I hope
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um because that would be considered
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
cruelty to that child
 
03:07:45.530 --> 03:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
so why is it okay to do it to an animal
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh the standard method of the chlorine
 
03:07:49.790 --> 03:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
is amputated with a scalpel or a
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
guillotine sometimes lasers are used but
 
03:07:54.889 --> 03:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
not often the wounds are closed with
 
03:07:57.290 --> 03:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
stitches or surgical glue and the feet
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
are bandaged up
 
03:08:01.730 --> 03:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the procedure is essentially 10
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
complex amputations on the animal so the
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
cat has 10 front claws 10 front fingers
 
03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
and they all get removed and amputated
 
03:08:11.640 --> 03:08:13.790 align:start position:0%
and they all get removed and amputated
uh

03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
a cat's core is a complex digit it is
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
not just a fingernail like on a human
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
the nails retract and are actuated by
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
muscles and tendons by cutting into
 
03:08:24.889 --> 03:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
these you raise the risk of serious
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
long-term physical and emotional impacts
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
on your cat the chlored cats in effect
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
are reduced to their ability to gain
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
traction and to walk properly so the cat
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
might gimple down a little more also a
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
03:08:42.530 --> 03:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
say oh it's just a house cat we could
 
03:08:44.210 --> 03:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
Decor it it's you know it's scratching
 
03:08:46.490 --> 03:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
my furniture what happens if that cat
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
gets into the wild it has no way to
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
protect itself
 
03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
from predators or anything else so if
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
you have a house cat that somehow gets
 
03:08:57.170 --> 03:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
out the front door the child leaves the
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
door open the calf wand is off it has no
 
03:09:02.690 --> 03:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
way to protect itself you can't climb a
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
tree it can't claw at the Predator it's
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
really gotten no defense mechanism uh
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
the consequences of the chlorine are
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
larger than many people realize cats
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
behaviors can change some people this
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
cat will stop biting more after being
 
03:09:21.469 --> 03:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
declawed as a defense mechanism
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
um some people will Decor their cats
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
cause say it scratches the person
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I still don't feel any animal
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
should be put through this crew
 
03:09:33.650 --> 03:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
amputation just for the benefit of
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
furniture or maybe the cat scratch it's
 
03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
natural it's a natural instinct so if
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
they go up to the you get get them a
 
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
scratching post with catnip if you don't
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
want a cat because it has claws you
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably should have never got a cat to
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
begin with in my opinion
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
um I make adaptations to my cats my dogs
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
I buy cheap furniture I got a 140 pound
 
03:09:57.650 --> 03:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
dog likes to lay out on the furniture
 
03:10:00.830 --> 03:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
you adapt to the animal
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
you don't amputate their digits
 
03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:05.150 align:start position:0%
you don't amputate their digits
um

03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
physical ailments such as premature
 
03:10:07.319 --> 03:10:08.750 align:start position:0%
physical ailments such as premature
arthritis

03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
arthritis
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh perennial skin disorders occurred
 
03:10:14.210 --> 03:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
Bungalow surgeries can result in growth
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
of deformed clause or serious infection
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
as well so I take it most veterinarians
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
are very good at what they do but if
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
something does go wrong with the surgery
 
03:10:27.290 --> 03:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
it could lead to further complications
 
03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
down the road like any other operation
 
03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:31.429 align:start position:0%
down the road like any other operation
um

03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
also removal of the last digits of the
 
03:10:36.230 --> 03:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
toe is drastically author's confirmation
 
03:10:38.090 --> 03:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
of their feet and causes their feet to
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
meet the ground at a unnatural angle so
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
the cat might walk a little awkward not
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
not not in the manner the cat was
 
03:10:50.330 --> 03:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
born to be walking and maneuvering the
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%

and the world's small animal veterinary
 
03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
Association all the uh opposed declaring
 
03:11:05.580 --> 03:11:06.650 align:start position:0%
Association all the uh opposed declaring
animals

03:11:06.650 --> 03:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
animals
 
03:11:08.450 --> 03:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
the Center for Disease Control and
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
prevention also does not recommend
 
03:11:13.490 --> 03:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
declawing a cat several major Hospital
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
groups my vet is actually a member of
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
them including Banfield BluePearl VCA
 
03:11:21.050 --> 03:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
have banned decoring all together so the
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
vet will not even the Chlor a cat if you
 
03:11:25.849 --> 03:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
ask them to unless it was for a
 
03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic reason
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
again many counties countries cities
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
03:11:36.050 --> 03:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um have begun Banning it it's been
 
03:11:40.030 --> 03:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
banned in New York for years upon years
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Maryland has also banned it and I'm open
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
for any questions you guys have I just
 
03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
really feel
 
03:11:49.370 --> 03:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
that is cruel
 
03:11:51.650 --> 03:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
to to do to an animal I wouldn't do it
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
to my dog would you declaw your dog
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
um dogs have what's called a dew core
 
03:11:58.190 --> 03:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
some people do elect to remove them
 
03:12:00.650 --> 03:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
personally I don't
 
03:12:00.660 --> 03:12:01.370 align:start position:0%
personally I don't
um

03:12:01.370 --> 03:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
again you wouldn't you wouldn't amputate
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
your child's hand for misbehaving so why
 
03:12:07.969 --> 03:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
would you do that to your animal
 
03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:11.650 --> 03:12:11.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative you have a question
 
03:12:14.090 --> 03:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative boards I'm just wondering
 
03:12:19.010 --> 03:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
how many declarings actually happen in
 
03:12:20.929 --> 03:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have an exact number I can
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
actually probably get that number for
 
03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:26.809 align:start position:0%
actually probably get that number for
you

03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:12:29.929 --> 03:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
it's enough that this is an issue in the
 
03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
seed itself
 
03:12:34.969 --> 03:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you madam chair I have
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
um spoken with several veterinarians
 
03:12:40.610 --> 03:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and over the course of
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
several years about the declaring of
 
03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
several years about the declaring of
cats

03:12:44.030 --> 03:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
cats
 
03:12:47.769 --> 03:12:47.779 align:start position:0%
and as a rule and
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
they discourage declaring our cats
 
03:12:54.290 --> 03:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
so does my understanding and and in
 
03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
talking with some vet techs that if they
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
see one declaw in a veterinarian
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
hospital per year
 
03:13:03.730 --> 03:13:03.740 align:start position:0%
that is Major in New Hampshire and
 
03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are health reasons for
 
03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:07.969 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are health reasons for
people

03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
to be able to declaw their cats I'm not
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
saying that declaring is pleasant but
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a choice of that elderly
 
03:13:18.050 --> 03:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
person being able to keep their pets or
 
03:13:21.469 --> 03:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
not and so I'm asking
 
03:13:23.929 --> 03:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
um you know because we have heard this
 
03:13:27.290 --> 03:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
bill several years want has the problem
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
increased or decreased in the declaring
 
03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
of cats in the state
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have the exact numbers with me
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
right now I can get those over to you
 
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
um it is an issue I've spoken to very
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
quite a few vet techs and veterinarians
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
um a lot of them actually will not even
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
perform it
 
03:13:47.690 --> 03:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
and this bill does have an exception for
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic reasons
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know of any medical condition
 
03:13:53.090 --> 03:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I could be wrong
 
03:13:55.370 --> 03:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
with the corner of a cat would be
 
03:13:55.380 --> 03:13:57.290 align:start position:0%
with the corner of a cat would be
necessary

03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:14:00.170 --> 03:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
um that's just the way I look at it I I
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
just feel it's cruel
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh representative germana
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as as you said uh
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
most vets probably choose not to do this
 
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
for for reasons that you've you've
 
03:14:18.050 --> 03:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
described well what would prevent a vet
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have those same Scruples
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
from Simply kind of recording in the
 
03:14:24.170 --> 03:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
records that they did it for therapeutic
 
03:14:27.410 --> 03:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
reasons right how does this law in the
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
end really stop uh the practice if in
 
03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
the end a veterinarian can simply say I
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
did it for therapeutic reasons I think
 
03:14:39.889 --> 03:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
they would have to show proof that it
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
was done for therapeutic reasons AKA and
 
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
X-ray and ultrasound or some sort of
 
03:14:47.210 --> 03:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
mechanism to say hey this cat had let's
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
just say some sort of bone cancer and we
 
03:14:51.170 --> 03:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
had to take care of the clue of the
 
03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
animal I would assume um there is the
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
exception in the bill for therapeutic
 
03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:57.410 align:start position:0%
exception in the bill for therapeutic
reasons

03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
I mean most vets I would
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
assume would be honest about it um I did
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
reduce this down to a civil fine
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I just have to speak into a lot of
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and people I just felt a
 
03:15:14.929 --> 03:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
civil fine would be a better way to
 
03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
handle this situation instead of going
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
after them in a criminal aspect
 
03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the key is to deter this from
 
03:15:23.929 --> 03:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
happening and and to kind of have a lore
 
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the books just saying hey we care
 
03:15:28.130 --> 03:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
about our animals here in New Hampshire
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to do any inhumane
 
03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:32.990 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to do any inhumane
treatment

03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
03:15:38.210 --> 03:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
you madam chair representative Potenza
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
03:15:44.090 --> 03:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
you just stated that um the majority of
 
03:15:45.889 --> 03:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and vet techs that you've
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
spoken to do not do this practice isn't
 
03:15:51.650 --> 03:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
this bill um an overreach in regards
 
03:15:54.230 --> 03:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
with private businesses as well as if
 
03:15:56.030 --> 03:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it
 
03:15:57.950 --> 03:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
um the majority of them are
 
03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of this bill
 
03:16:03.650 --> 03:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
I do not feel this is an overreach
 
03:16:06.050 --> 03:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I think it is our responsibility to
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
look out for our beloved animals again
 
03:16:11.210 --> 03:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
if you chop a child's finger off it's
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
considered child abuse so why can we say
 
03:16:18.410 --> 03:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's okay to chop a animal's claws off
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:24.170 --> 03:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how this could be a
 
03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
government overreach it's it's a common
 
03:16:26.819 --> 03:16:28.190 align:start position:0%
government overreach it's it's a common
sense

03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
but I think the point is that we're
 
03:16:39.950 --> 03:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
talking about Veterinary associations as
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
well that are only using this if there's
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
like something physically wrong with the
 
03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:46.370 align:start position:0%
like something physically wrong with the
cat

03:16:46.370 --> 03:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
cat
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic that was mentioned I
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize that so
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
if we're talking 99.9 of everyone that
 
03:16:55.010 --> 03:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
is in the profession agrees with you
 
03:16:57.650 --> 03:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
what is the point of having this
 
03:17:00.769 --> 03:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
I just feel it's something we want to
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
make sure does not happen just for
 
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
the benefit of furniture or
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances like that
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah there are a lot of veterinarians
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
that don't perform it but they're also
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
still some that you could go find that
 
03:17:18.050 --> 03:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
will perform the operation again
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
therapeutic reasons health of the animal
 
03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine but just to do it in a
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
cruel manage because you don't like the
 
03:17:26.929 --> 03:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
cat scratching your furniture I just
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.690 --> 03:17:32.700 align:start position:0%

03:17:34.010 --> 03:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
curious uh to know whether or not when
 
03:17:46.490 --> 03:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
it says any person who violates this
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
section is that the person being the
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
owner of the animal or is that the
 
03:17:52.020 --> 03:17:53.570 align:start position:0%
owner of the animal or is that the
veterinarian

03:17:53.570 --> 03:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
03:17:55.969 --> 03:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
the way I understand and the way it was
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
I meant to write it would be the
 
03:18:01.849 --> 03:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
veterinarian not the actual
 
03:18:01.859 --> 03:18:03.889 align:start position:0%
veterinarian not the actual
um person

03:18:03.889 --> 03:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
um person
 
03:18:08.210 --> 03:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.670 --> 03:18:10.680 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:21.290 --> 03:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
please put on your uh red just press the
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
button press There You Go technology
 
03:19:26.450 --> 03:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful stuff my name is Nancy
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
Holmes I'm here today from New Boston
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to speak in opposition to
 
03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:32.510 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:34.730 --> 03:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
I too was unclear as to whether or not
 
03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bill was intended for veterinarians
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
only or for people who owned cats who
 
03:19:41.690 --> 03:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
happen to have been declawed I know that
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
shelters Place declawed cats I know
 
03:19:47.690 --> 03:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
people move here with declawed cats so
 
03:19:49.790 --> 03:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
it would be an issue if it was going to
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
be somebody who owned the declaw cat was
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
going to be suddenly be fine for doing
 
03:19:53.580 --> 03:19:55.910 align:start position:0%
going to be suddenly be fine for doing
so

03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that choices in Veterinary
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
Care should remain between the animal
 
03:20:03.730 --> 03:20:03.740 align:start position:0%
owner and their veterinarian
 
03:20:06.830 --> 03:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
right now a veterinarian owner can in
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
Partnership choose to determine for
 
03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
procedures right or necessary for pets
 
03:20:10.740 --> 03:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
procedures right or necessary for pets
well-being

03:20:12.230 --> 03:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
03:20:14.929 --> 03:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
well-being can include the fact that if
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the owner cannot declaw the cat they can
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
no longer keep the cat
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
some people resolve their problem with
 
03:20:24.050 --> 03:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
the cat by Throwing It Outdoors
 
03:20:26.330 --> 03:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
and claws are not the Predators around
 
03:20:29.570 --> 03:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
here think cat's a nice tasty treat and
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
I know that in my neighborhood I am the
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
only person who has a cat that lives
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
into their teens and I had one go into
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
his 20s because my cats are indoor cats
 
03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
the people who have at their cats
 
03:20:43.370 --> 03:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
Outdoors replace them every couple of
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
years it's it's sad but you know it's
 
03:20:48.349 --> 03:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
the way it is
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
um there are situations where for a cat
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
to remain in its home declaring is the
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
best option this may be to protect the
 
03:20:59.210 --> 03:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
owner's health
 
03:21:01.550 --> 03:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
some of you may know someone who's on
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
blood thinners and who have scratched by
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
their cat even innocently as it ran by
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever would be in severe trouble
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
from bleeding that's not an uncommon
 
03:21:13.130 --> 03:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
situation for an elderly person to have
 
03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
a beloved cat that's a little careless
 
03:21:18.050 --> 03:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
with its claws
 
03:21:18.060 --> 03:21:19.849 align:start position:0%
with its claws
um

03:21:19.849 --> 03:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:22.490 --> 03:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
cats that don't conform to people's
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
expected behaviors
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
can be subject to a variety of
 
03:21:29.889 --> 03:21:29.899 align:start position:0%
punishments for this
 
03:21:32.510 --> 03:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
you could actually prevent cruelty to
 
03:21:35.570 --> 03:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
the cat by having it declawed which
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
changes the owner animal relationship so
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the owner is happy with the animal
 
03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:42.530 align:start position:0%
that the owner is happy with the animal
um

03:21:42.530 --> 03:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
when you wonder what on Earth I could be
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
talking about for punishment think of a
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
cat duct taped
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's a that's one way to keep the
 
03:21:51.230 --> 03:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
claws under control you just duct tape
 
03:21:54.290 --> 03:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
all the feet not a good thing
 
03:21:54.300 --> 03:21:54.889 align:start position:0%
all the feet not a good thing
um

03:21:54.889 --> 03:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know there are cats that are really
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
easy to train to have their claws
 
03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
trimmed to use Soft Paws to use only a
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
scratching post and then this cat's like
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
the one I have that's 12 years old that
 
03:22:07.969 --> 03:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
my veterinarian refers to as the cat
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
from hell
 
03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:10.929 align:start position:0%
from hell
um

03:22:10.929 --> 03:22:10.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:13.849 --> 03:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
not kidding it takes two vet techs and
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian to hold this cat to do
 
03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
anything to it she and I have come to an
 
03:22:20.690 --> 03:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
agreement she's an indoor cat only and
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
she's discovered that if she'll let if I
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
trim her claws she gets a really nice
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
treat there was a lot of wounds involved
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
before the cat got the point you know I
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
I just um
 
03:22:35.929 --> 03:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to put up with that and deal
 
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
with that I'm willing to buy the cheap
 
03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
furniture if a cat happens to scratch
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
the furniture not everybody is
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's true and that
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they don't like cats it
 
03:22:48.050 --> 03:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
means they may have a cat that just
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly they have a cat that does not
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
conform the expected Behavior
 
03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:54.710 align:start position:0%
conform the expected Behavior
um

03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
so it was mentioned that a cat a cathis
 
03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
declawed that goes outside has no
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
protections against being attacked by
 
03:23:04.330 --> 03:23:04.340 align:start position:0%
Wildlife or whatever
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
the truth of the matter is a cat that
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those protections is more
 
03:23:11.330 --> 03:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
is less apt to fight and more apt to run
 
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
like crazy to get away from whatever the
 
03:23:15.050 --> 03:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
hazard is
 
03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:15.650 align:start position:0%
hazard is
um

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know that you did mention those
 
03:23:19.729 --> 03:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
medically necessary reasons for doing
 
03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
such a procedure and
 
03:23:27.050 --> 03:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
I just look at this bill and I think I
 
03:23:29.650 --> 03:23:29.660 align:start position:0%
don't want the legislature telling me
 
03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
what I can discuss with my vet as an
 
03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
option to do I think most of the
 
03:23:36.650 --> 03:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
veterinarians even the ones who do
 
03:23:39.530 --> 03:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
declaws will sit there and talk and
 
03:23:42.650 --> 03:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
counsel a person and discuss with them
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
all the other options they have
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
available to them before they go as far
 
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
as declaring I think if declaring is
 
03:23:53.150 --> 03:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
done correctly it's no worse than any
 
03:23:55.969 --> 03:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
other optional surgery we choose for our
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
animals and you know if you
 
03:24:00.769 --> 03:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
if you try to think about well the cat
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to lose its claws I
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee you the cat wouldn't want to
 
03:24:06.769 --> 03:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
lose its ovaries or his testicles either
 
03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
there's no no animal out there that
 
03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
would agree to not being able to
 
03:24:10.739 --> 03:24:13.130 align:start position:0%
would agree to not being able to
reproduce

03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
reproduce
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
the um and the thing is you know any
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
surgery you do is hazardous to the
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
animal and yet we choose to do it anyway
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
because these are our companion animals
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
and we want them to be the best
 
03:24:27.290 --> 03:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
companions we can have now in my case
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'll put up with the cat that that uses
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
its claws inappropriately and other
 
03:24:34.370 --> 03:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
people's cases that's not possible and
 
03:24:36.290 --> 03:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
again I know that there are many people
 
03:24:39.050 --> 03:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
for whom it's medically necessary that
 
03:24:42.050 --> 03:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
they have a cat that does not claw them
 
03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:43.070 align:start position:0%
they have a cat that does not claw them
um

03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
and what happens if they can't get the
 
03:24:47.809 --> 03:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
cat declawed
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
what happens to that cat
 
03:24:53.330 --> 03:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
end up in a shelter well there's like a
 
03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
last time I checked it was like a three
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
or four month waiting list to get a cat
 
03:24:58.610 --> 03:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
into a shelter if it was an aggressive
 
03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
cat or a bad you know a difficult cat
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's not likely to get placed
 
03:25:04.319 --> 03:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
that's not likely to get placed
um

03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things to consider here
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
I really do not believe that the
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in New Hampshire are out
 
03:25:13.010 --> 03:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
there declaring cats every day I think
 
03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
most people have cats with claws and if
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
the number of cat trees sold there's any
 
03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:19.670 align:start position:0%
the number of cat trees sold there's any
indication

03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
indication
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of people try to do
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
different techniques to keep their cats
 
03:25:25.250 --> 03:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
from chlorine anything they care about
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
but anyway I just want to say I'm
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
definitely opposed to this bill because
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
getting between a veterinarian and an
 
03:25:34.010 --> 03:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
owner in terms of the patient's
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
well-being I just think that is
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely wrong
 
03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very question thank you any
 
03:25:42.170 --> 03:25:42.180 align:start position:0%

03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%

03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
hand them up if they are interested in

committee
 
03:26:37.969 --> 03:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
my name is Joan O'Brien I'm from Amherst
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to represent the New
 
03:26:42.889 --> 03:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire animal rights league in
 
03:26:46.090 --> 03:26:46.100 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 231
 
03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
I will let our hsus state director
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
address some of the
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
myths surrounding cat decline when he
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
testifies and I know that once again you
 
03:27:01.370 --> 03:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
know many of you are here hearing this
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
for the second or even third time for
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
some of you it's new
 
03:27:08.510 --> 03:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this legislation
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
continues to be proposed I believe
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
speaks to how adamantly the people of
 
03:27:15.889 --> 03:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire want to see this procedure
 
03:27:19.130 --> 03:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
retired through the law
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
during past hearings for the declaw Bill
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
much of the discussion is focused on
 
03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
trying to establish how many cats in New
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are subjected to the procedure
 
03:27:31.969 --> 03:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
and that's come up already this morning
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
I mean this afternoon
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I think while it's understandable
 
03:27:37.490 --> 03:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
that we'd want to try and quantify the
 
03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
problem for the individual cat whose
 
03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
body is permanently altered the
 
03:27:47.090 --> 03:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:48.769 --> 03:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
um we have also heard in the past and
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
we'll probably again today
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
from veterinarians who say they have not
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
performed the surgery in a very long
 
03:27:54.479 --> 03:27:55.790 align:start position:0%
performed the surgery in a very long
time

03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that they actively discourage it
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
and it would follow then that if the law
 
03:28:02.809 --> 03:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
were changed to formally retire the
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
procedure would have little impact on
 
03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
the veterinary business in New Hampshire
 
03:28:10.610 --> 03:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
as far as concerns about making
 
03:28:12.650 --> 03:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
criminals out of veterinarians any
 
03:28:14.330 --> 03:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who acts in the best
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
interest of the cat would have nothing
 
03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
lost my place
 
03:28:26.510 --> 03:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
if needed the medical exemption is
 
03:28:28.610 --> 03:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
always available
 
03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens are more
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
concerned about the real and present
 
03:28:34.490 --> 03:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
danger to cats then to the outside
 
03:28:36.769 --> 03:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
possibility that a veterinarian might be
 
03:28:39.410 --> 03:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
asked to justify a declaw surgery
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
once in a blue moon
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
as long as this procedure is legal in
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire some people will still
 
03:28:47.690 --> 03:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
have it done
 
03:28:49.969 --> 03:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
if passing this law could prevent even
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
10 cats that one percent
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
from during this crippling surgery why
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we
 
03:28:59.690 --> 03:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
so we urge the committee to support this
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill so the New Hampshire can retire
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
03:29:12.650 --> 03:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
are you willing to ask all the questions
 
03:29:15.050 --> 03:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking uh my
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
question so I was I'm wondering is
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
similar to the question I asked the the
 
03:29:25.729 --> 03:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative are you familiar with
 
03:29:27.710 --> 03:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
when other states have banned this
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
practice what requirements do they have
 
03:29:33.469 --> 03:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
on a veterinarian to document medical
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
need right because as I said unless
 
03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
there is some specific
 
03:29:39.769 --> 03:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
requirement regarding the keeping of
 
03:29:42.650 --> 03:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
Records should there be an inquiry I can
 
03:29:44.690 --> 03:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
imagine again most veterinarians are
 
03:29:45.889 --> 03:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
going to do this but if we think about
 
03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians who will do it uh if
 
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of them simply stating uh
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
that they are doing it for for a
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic reason a medically necessary
 
03:29:57.290 --> 03:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
reason I I find it hard to see how the
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
law would be effective so in any way are
 
03:30:01.729 --> 03:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
you familiar in places where it has been
 
03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
outlawed what the requirement is on the
 
03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
Bahar on the behalf of veterinarians to
 
03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
document medical need
 
03:30:13.010 --> 03:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
no I'm not but I believe that when
 
03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
something becomes illegal that is going
 
03:30:17.450 --> 03:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
to be enough of a deterrent for a
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to to not not even consider
 
03:30:23.450 --> 03:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
performing the procedure and we have
 
03:30:25.490 --> 03:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
many laws where we where it is just out
 
03:30:28.969 --> 03:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
there to be used when needed if there's
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
a question or a suspicion
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
03:30:33.840 --> 03:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
chair

03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:30:37.610 --> 03:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
03:30:38.929 --> 03:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I wonder if you
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
did speak to how complicated the surgery
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
is because just looking at your hand out
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
really quickly you have an article about
 
03:30:47.090 --> 03:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
bone fragments and the complications
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
that can arise from the surgery so
 
03:30:50.990 --> 03:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
is there concern that if you have fewer
 
03:30:53.769 --> 03:30:53.779 align:start position:0%
people doing these surgeries they'll be
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
worse outcomes over time
 
03:30:59.809 --> 03:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
are you are you asking if we'd have less
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
expert expertise if the procedure were
 
03:31:05.330 --> 03:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
less common well yeah I guess it's sort
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
of a two-part question that and is it
 
03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
considered a complicated surgery that
 
03:31:10.729 --> 03:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
you do sometimes have these adverse
 
03:31:12.650 --> 03:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
outcomes with relationship to the Bone
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
fragments that are mentioned in this
 
03:31:17.450 --> 03:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
article we have heard from veterinarians
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
in at past hearings that it is actually
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
rather a a crude surgery
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you know just basically an amputation
 
03:31:26.160 --> 03:31:27.769 align:start position:0%
um you know just basically an amputation
and

03:31:27.769 --> 03:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
with the outcome often being completely
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
unknown and and and a cat leaves and you
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
never know what problems it is taking
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
with it if done improperly bone
 
03:31:40.490 --> 03:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
fragments can end up
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
um being you know retained Under the
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
Skin and the cat will feel as though
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's walking on the pebble for the rest
 
03:31:49.250 --> 03:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
of its life and that's just sort of an
 
03:31:50.929 --> 03:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable outcome there are there
 
03:31:53.210 --> 03:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
are there are worse health risks such as
 
03:31:55.849 --> 03:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
developing arthritis
 
03:31:58.849 --> 03:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
um it throws off a cat's balance as the
 
03:32:00.650 --> 03:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor mentioned and that can
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
really that can lead to other
 
03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:03.530 align:start position:0%
really that can lead to other
um

03:32:03.530 --> 03:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:10.969 --> 03:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:32:14.090 --> 03:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
oh follow-up sort of a separate question
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
but I wonder
 
03:32:17.330 --> 03:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
um how your organization Compares this
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
with other sort of elective surgeries
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
such as tail clipping or ear clipping in
 
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.190 align:start position:0%
such as tail clipping or ear clipping in
dogs

03:32:22.190 --> 03:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
03:32:24.769 --> 03:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
you view it as similarly
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
undesirable painful
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
today we're just talking about cat
 
03:32:29.279 --> 03:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
today we're just talking about cat
declawing

03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:34.849 --> 03:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:32:36.769 --> 03:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:32:40.610 --> 03:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
today I call Kurt Ehrenberg to
 
03:32:40.620 --> 03:32:42.290 align:start position:0%
today I call Kurt Ehrenberg to
testify

03:32:42.290 --> 03:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and you've asked
 
03:32:51.170 --> 03:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I am Kurt Ehrenberg I'm
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
the state director of the Humane Society
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the United States and I'm here to
 
03:32:58.680 --> 03:32:59.750 align:start position:0%
of the United States and I'm here to
support

03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:33:01.130 --> 03:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:33:01.140 --> 03:33:02.929 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

03:33:02.929 --> 03:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:06.290 --> 03:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a barbaric practice that
 
03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:07.490 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a barbaric practice that
no

03:33:07.490 --> 03:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
pet owner that loved their pet would
 
03:33:12.729 --> 03:33:12.739 align:start position:0%
perform on their pet
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
I think we have to make sure we're
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
talking we know what we're talking about
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
if if I were a cat
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
it'd be lopping off my fingers at the at
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is it's not a declaw
 
03:33:31.130 --> 03:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
where they pull out the claw it's taking
 
03:33:33.290 --> 03:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
off the fingers the toes whatever you
 
03:33:35.050 --> 03:33:35.060 align:start position:0%
want to call them
 
03:33:37.729 --> 03:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
it's irreparable
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's cruel and barbaric
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is no we cannot find in this state
 
03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
a reputable veterinarian who says they
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
do it
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
which is why you cannot quantify
 
03:33:57.530 --> 03:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.130 --> 03:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
as a citizen of New Hampshire I think we
 
03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
should not rely on the unknown
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
in order to decide not to stop a
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
barbaric practice that would affect the
 
03:34:14.450 --> 03:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
animals in this state
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
and my job is to represent the animals
 
03:34:20.690 --> 03:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
in this state and uh today for the cats
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
that face this because they may have an
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
owner that's
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
too lazy to figure out how to protect
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
their furniture
 
03:34:34.429 --> 03:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
who believes erroneously that uh cat
 
03:34:36.650 --> 03:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
claws are a
 
03:34:36.660 --> 03:34:38.330 align:start position:0%
claws are a
uh

03:34:38.330 --> 03:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
a danger to their health I mean I would
 
03:34:45.729 --> 03:34:45.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
I broke down somewhere
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
there's no there is no
 
03:34:55.729 --> 03:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
diagnostic therapeutic
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
reason for this surgery
 
03:35:01.250 --> 03:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
again find me a vet that says they
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
perform this for any reason at all
 
03:35:08.650 --> 03:35:08.660 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here no so why are we
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to as a state to support this
 
03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:14.330 align:start position:0%
continuing to as a state to support this
practice

03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
just because we can't quantify the
 
03:35:17.819 --> 03:35:19.090 align:start position:0%
just because we can't quantify the
incidences

03:35:19.090 --> 03:35:19.100 align:start position:0%
incidences
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I would just go over I mean I did
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
email to you all my testimony so I hope
 
03:35:28.610 --> 03:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
you have that
 
03:35:30.650 --> 03:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
um my practice is usually to read the
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
testimony so actually you hear it
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
but I think today I will not do that I
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.690 --> 03:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
I mean what I want to say is this is a
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
barbaric practice there's no good reason
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
to continue it and let's just stop it
 
03:35:50.210 --> 03:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
um you just stated that there was no let
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
me just go back there and read your
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
words there is no diagnostic therapeutic
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
reason to perform this surgery
 
03:36:10.130 --> 03:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh thank you madam chair so
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
the section that says that a
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
veterinarian can perform it for a
 
03:36:23.399 --> 03:36:24.650 align:start position:0%
veterinarian can perform it for a
therapeutic

03:36:24.650 --> 03:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
03:36:24.660 --> 03:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
reasons

03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:36:27.889 --> 03:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
do you believe that is necessary to be
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
in that bill
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that Veterinary uh profession
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to perform
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedures that they think are
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary I'm not a
 
03:36:38.279 --> 03:36:39.410 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary I'm not a
veterinarian

03:36:39.410 --> 03:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
I do not have the expertise I can only
 
03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
give you my opinion
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.849 --> 03:36:51.859 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
03:36:54.769 --> 03:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
I think that you just said there are no
 
03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:02.819 align:start position:0%
reputable veterinarians that are
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
performing this in the state of New
 
03:37:06.530 --> 03:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as far as I know
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up follow-up so that means
 
03:37:12.769 --> 03:37:12.779 align:start position:0%
no one's doing it
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
we can't find anyone who'll admit to
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
doing it we do know
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
that that the that this happens all over
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
the country in places where it is banned
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
it happens much much less frequently and
 
03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
just to to to to answer the question of
 
03:37:37.849 --> 03:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
if if a if a veterinarian can lie to us
 
03:37:40.729 --> 03:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
and say that it's therapeutic
 
03:37:42.170 --> 03:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
um then why would we pass this
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean you could say that
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
about any any criminal uh violation or
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
penalty law against any crime okay thank
 
03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:50.870 align:start position:0%
penalty law against any crime okay thank
you

03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
03:37:56.690 --> 03:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes so if it's so hard to find people
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
who are doing this uh what would the
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the penalty but how do
 
03:38:12.889 --> 03:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
we find the people who are doing it so
 
03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:16.460 align:start position:0%
well the so I would think that any
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who was a professional who
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
did all the schooling and all of the
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
work to become a veterinarian care for
 
03:38:25.729 --> 03:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
these animals
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
would not be lying to us about a
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
barbaric procedure that they some for
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Contour thank
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you again for
 
03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:43.250 align:start position:0%
taking my question
now

03:38:43.250 --> 03:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:38:43.260 --> 03:38:45.469 align:start position:0%
now
sometimes

03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's kind of like a
 
03:38:47.880 --> 03:38:49.210 align:start position:0%
there's kind of like a
owner

03:38:49.210 --> 03:38:49.220 align:start position:0%
owner
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
veterinarian relationship going on here
 
03:38:54.290 --> 03:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
and if the veterinarian has done
 
03:38:56.809 --> 03:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
everything that they can in discussing
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
and the only option for that person that
 
03:39:02.090 --> 03:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
owner to keep that cat is to declare it
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't you think that should be between
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
the owner and the veterinarian
 
03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
well I think that's the issue we're
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.450 --> 03:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:39:14.460 --> 03:39:16.490 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

03:39:16.490 --> 03:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh yes how many
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
cats do you currently represent and how
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
many of them are in danger of getting
 
03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
their claws removed
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:29.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
I

03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:39:33.710 --> 03:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't directly represent any cats I
 
03:39:37.490 --> 03:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't own a cat but I uh represent all
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
the animals in the state through my
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
organization the Humane Society the
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions

see none thank you for your testimony
 
03:39:58.729 --> 03:39:58.739 align:start position:0%

and you've requested three minutes as
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
well and I see you have testimony thank
 
03:40:02.399 --> 03:40:04.610 align:start position:0%
well and I see you have testimony thank
you

03:40:04.610 --> 03:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:09.229 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Angela Ferrari and
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of dog owners of the
 
03:40:18.889 --> 03:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
Granite State we are a membership of
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
responsible local pet owners and we do
 
03:40:23.929 --> 03:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
include cat owners and cat breeders as
 
03:40:23.939 --> 03:40:25.610 align:start position:0%
include cat owners and cat breeders as
well

03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:40:30.170 --> 03:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I am here to oppose this bill and
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
more so on the fact of how it gets in
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
between the veterinarian and the owner
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
not so much as a particular supporter of
 
03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
the procedure itself but just the fact
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
that if we start telling veterinarians
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do I think
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
we're stepping over a boundary and as
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you have previously
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
heard most veterinarians if not all in
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are not performing this
 
03:41:00.530 --> 03:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
procedure unless it is absolutely
 
03:41:00.540 --> 03:41:02.630 align:start position:0%
procedure unless it is absolutely
necessary

03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:41:02.640 --> 03:41:03.610 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

03:41:03.610 --> 03:41:03.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
we don't think that it's an issue of
 
03:41:07.929 --> 03:41:07.939 align:start position:0%
Humane treatment of animals and actually
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
legitimizes activist campaigns to
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily restrict the rights of
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
animal owners and veterinarians
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
the avma respects the veterinarian's
 
03:41:20.510 --> 03:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
right to use professional judgment when
 
03:41:22.490 --> 03:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
deciding how to best protect their
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
individual patients Health and Welfare
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
and we agree with them and always
 
03:41:30.050 --> 03:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
recommend working with an animal to curb
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
bad behaviors before turning to a
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
medical procedure however when all else
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
fails and a veterinarian determines and
 
03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
this is the veterinarian determining
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
that decline is the only remaining
 
03:41:43.969 --> 03:41:43.979 align:start position:0%
solution that decision should remain a
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
choice between owner and veterinarian
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard most veterinarians
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
are not performing this procedure we did
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
have one of our members last year when
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill previously call and
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
talk to veterinarians and more than 50
 
03:42:02.210 --> 03:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
percent of them couldn't remember the
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
last time that they had even performed
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
it and most of the facilities in New
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aren't offering the procedure
 
03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
so we think that that's a clear
 
03:42:13.729 --> 03:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
indication that this is not an issue
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I think you'll
 
03:42:21.410 --> 03:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.420 --> 03:42:22.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:22.610 --> 03:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
speaking of elective convenience
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
procedures which is what we're hearing
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
this most referred to when it isn't
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
being used for therapeutic purposes also
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned by Ms Holmes previously Spain
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
and neuterine is considered an elective
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
and convenience procedure and with any
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
procedure there's going to be potential
 
03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
for side effects if in the documentation
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
that was handed out I'm sure you saw
 
03:42:51.290 --> 03:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
some pretty gruesome images I'm assuming
 
03:42:54.889 --> 03:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
if you were to see images of near any
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
procedure that's surgical it isn't going
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
to be very pretty that's why we have
 
03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who are trained to do
 
03:43:04.849 --> 03:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
these procedures and it isn't something
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
that just anybody does
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
but that is any procedure that happens
 
03:43:13.370 --> 03:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
and there are side effects even when you
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
get your cat or dog spayed there's
 
03:43:17.570 --> 03:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
potential that a piece of the ovary
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
could be remaining and they could
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
continue to have side effects from that
 
03:43:25.010 --> 03:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
um just for a small example
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
in my testimony that I had emailed
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday to you I included an article
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
for a bill in Missouri which would
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
actually reverse a similar bill that was
 
03:43:38.769 --> 03:43:38.779 align:start position:0%
passed there in 2019 this is their
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
sb-115 this bill would protect
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine while HB 231 the
 
03:43:47.150 --> 03:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill we're discussing today actually
 
03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
opens the doors to restrict veterinary
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
medicine here in New Hampshire
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
we should not legislate anything that
 
03:43:56.929 --> 03:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
prohibits restricts limits regulates
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
controls directs or interferes with the
 
03:44:01.729 --> 03:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
practice of veterinary medicine and that
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
is actually the language that is used in
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
the Missouri bill
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
that bill has the support of many
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
organizations including veterinarians
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
the American Veterinary Medical
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
Association the Farm Bureau of Missouri
 
03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
the Federation of animal owners among
 
03:44:20.570 --> 03:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
many others and I did include a link to
 
03:44:23.150 --> 03:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
those organizations who signed in in
 
03:44:26.210 --> 03:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so lastly I think that we need to let
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians continue to educate
 
03:44:33.889 --> 03:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
their clients about Decline and not make
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
anyone's criminals if they feel it's
 
03:44:38.570 --> 03:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
best to perform this necessary procedure
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
I also find it a big ask to expect
 
03:44:44.929 --> 03:44:44.939 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to have to start providing
 
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
proof and justification for procedures
 
03:44:49.849 --> 03:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
that they are performing when they feel
 
03:44:52.450 --> 03:44:52.460 align:start position:0%
that they are suitable for the animals
 
03:44:55.190 --> 03:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
what procedures is that going to be next
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
are we going to have to have a registry
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
where they're submitting proof to move
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
forward with performing procedures I
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
think that actually could hinder
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
procedures happening to animals if this
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
is needed on the veterinarian's behalf
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for considering my
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
testimony and hope that you will vote
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate once
 
03:45:16.319 --> 03:45:17.110 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate once
again

03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
to avoid implementing legislation that
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
prevents owners and veterinarians for
 
03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
making the best choice for New Hampshire
 
03:45:25.969 --> 03:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
pets and I would be happy to take any
 
03:45:27.769 --> 03:45:27.779 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative germano thank you madam
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I am as my
 
03:45:37.130 --> 03:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
previous question is kind of indicates
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
kind of skeptical about whether or not
 
03:45:40.190 --> 03:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
this will address really address the
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem that it's intended to but to
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
play Devil's Advocate at what point does
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
any procedure right
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
dealing with an animal become cruelty
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
right in the sense that the sponsor
 
03:45:55.610 --> 03:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
referred to to the cruelty of this we
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
have laws which prevent cruelty to to
 
03:46:00.170 --> 03:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
animals and the kind of the bar
 
03:46:02.210 --> 03:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
historically as to what constitutes
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
cruelty has moved a lot over the years
 
03:46:06.849 --> 03:46:06.859 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious as to your thoughts about
 
03:46:11.150 --> 03:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
at what point uh a procedure for example
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
for an animal becomes cruel because this
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill does have an exception for for
 
03:46:17.929 --> 03:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
medical reasons so in that sense a
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
veterinarian would would be within their
 
03:46:21.889 --> 03:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
legal rights to perform a procedure if
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
it was for medical reasons so if if you
 
03:46:26.410 --> 03:46:26.420 align:start position:0%
could share with us your thoughts about
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
why this doesn't in your mind cross that
 
03:46:33.170 --> 03:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
threshold and become cruelty
 
03:46:35.809 --> 03:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
I think that if this procedure was being
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
performed not under a licensed
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
veterinarian's care without anesthesia
 
03:46:43.250 --> 03:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
for example then you would be venturing
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
into a cruelty consideration I think
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
that if a veterinarian who does have an
 
03:46:52.729 --> 03:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
oath that they take when they become a
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that they're going to do
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
the best that they can for the animal
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
protection of Animal Health and Welfare
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
the prevention and relief of animal
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
suffering the conservation of animal
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
resources the promotion of Public Health
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the advancement of medical knowledge
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
if they aren't adhering to that oath
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
then we could enter into a cruelty
 
03:47:14.640 --> 03:47:15.950 align:start position:0%
then we could enter into a cruelty
situation

03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
chair representative datsey
 
03:47:23.150 --> 03:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we have many uh
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
laws on the books that ban practices
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
um between that that a doctor and a
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
patient might feel that is in a
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
patient's best interest so why is this
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
I think because there are many reasons
 
03:47:44.450 --> 03:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
that it could need to be done it's
 
03:47:46.130 --> 03:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
something that can be done with
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesia in proper procedural ways
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's been done for many years with
 
03:47:56.150 --> 03:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
many positive outcomes and if the
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and the owners feel that
 
03:48:01.010 --> 03:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate for the animal then it
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
should remain between them to make that
 
03:48:02.640 --> 03:48:04.070 align:start position:0%
should remain between them to make that
decision

03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh yes but can you speak specifically to
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor-patient relationship and the
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
animal veterinary relationship because
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
basically we do have laws on the books
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
that ban doctors and their patients who
 
03:48:24.050 --> 03:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
agree on a procedure from doing various
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
things and I see this bill as basically
 
03:48:28.910 --> 03:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing so I don't
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
understand why one relationship is okay
 
03:48:34.969 --> 03:48:34.979 align:start position:0%
but the other isn't
 
03:48:37.969 --> 03:48:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you I am not a doctor and I am not
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with those type of bands that
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
are in place so I couldn't speak to that
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm here on behalf of the
 
03:48:49.250 --> 03:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
animals and the animal owners
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:54.170 --> 03:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
03:48:56.809 --> 03:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
today and I call Representative Ellen
 
03:48:56.819 --> 03:48:58.550 align:start position:0%

03:48:59.570 --> 03:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:59.580 --> 03:49:00.769 align:start position:0%
um
welcome

03:49:00.769 --> 03:49:00.779 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you madam chair and
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
03:49:11.330 --> 03:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
that's new market and new fields and
 
03:49:14.210 --> 03:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
also for the record I own own care for
 
03:49:17.570 --> 03:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
three cats all like their ages are 16 15
 
03:49:19.849 --> 03:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
and 14 I've had them all since their
 
03:49:22.370 --> 03:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
kitten hood and I've in my adult life
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
and well into my childhood I've never
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
been without without multiple cats so I
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's a topic I consider myself well
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
versed in
 
03:49:30.359 --> 03:49:31.010 align:start position:0%
versed in
um

03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:33.170 --> 03:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
you have repeatedly heard I think the
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
main argument from opposition on this
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I am in in support as a
 
03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:38.809 align:start position:0%
bill and I am in in support as a
co-sponsor

03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
is the concept of private decision the
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
private decision between a doctor and uh
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
the owner of an animal
 
03:49:46.859 --> 03:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
the owner of an animal
um

03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:49.849 --> 03:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
there are many cases as was brought up
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we interfere with those private
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
decisions in fact that idea of private
 
03:49:55.849 --> 03:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
decision has consistently been used over
 
03:49:58.690 --> 03:49:58.700 align:start position:0%
the ages as an argument to prevent
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on cruel behavior
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
um when we were putting in place uh
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
protective measures for children there
 
03:50:08.809 --> 03:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
was the argument of parents well I
 
03:50:10.010 --> 03:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
should be able to beat my children
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's a private decision as the the
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
parent of the child I recently saw a
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
documentary I think it was in Iran where
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
a man and this is a topic of much uh
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
discussion there today A man was
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
vehemently defending his right to beat
 
03:50:28.969 --> 03:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
his wife
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
because it's his private home and his
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
private relationship with his wife and
 
03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
nobody should interfere they should get
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
out of his business when uh measures
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
were proposed to uh mandate certain care
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for slaves
 
03:50:47.330 --> 03:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
slave owners came back and said that's a
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
private decision the slaves are my
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
property how dare you
 
03:50:53.570 --> 03:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I am personally responsible for
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
extending a anti-cruelty measure which
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
we heard that same exact language
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
private private decisions we do
 
03:51:04.849 --> 03:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
interfere because with private decisions
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
because private decisions sometimes are
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
not acceptable sometimes there are Bad
 
03:51:11.330 --> 03:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
actors in fact I would argue that all of
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
our law is written for Bad actors not
 
03:51:16.490 --> 03:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
good actors Benjamin Franklin said that
 
03:51:18.290 --> 03:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
if all men were Angels government would
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
not be necessary
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
so we do we do do that
 
03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:23.690 align:start position:0%
so we do we do do that
um

03:51:23.690 --> 03:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
the another argument I heard was the
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
health of the owner this is another one
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
I've heard over the years
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so just for the record there are
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
little claw caps that are very easy
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
cheap to buy and easy to put on there's
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
also claw trimming that's easily done to
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
prevent scratches if an owner I mean you
 
03:51:44.769 --> 03:51:44.779 align:start position:0%
could argue that maybe if someone was
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about scratches
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they shouldn't have a cat
 
03:51:51.849 --> 03:51:51.859 align:start position:0%
anyway or maybe any animal but
 
03:51:54.650 --> 03:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
a very simple easy alternative to make
 
03:51:55.729 --> 03:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
sure you're not getting scratched
 
03:51:57.650 --> 03:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
however if you declaw cat
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a much worse Health
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
consideration for the owner because cats
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
that are declawed resort to biting much
 
03:52:07.969 --> 03:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
much sooner and when this came up last
 
03:52:10.010 --> 03:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
time around I I because this issue was
 
03:52:12.610 --> 03:52:12.620 align:start position:0%
was brought up I asked a medical doctor
 
03:52:15.530 --> 03:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
for the record which is worse to treat
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
in humans a cat scratch or a cat bite
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
and universally cat bites are harder to
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
treat they are usually more penetrative
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
we heard a few moments ago someone say
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
and I wrote down the phrase because it
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
it bothered me that the surgery would be
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
necessary for the owner to be happy with
 
03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
an animal and there's your line for
 
03:52:42.170 --> 03:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
cruelty because it's right in the bill
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
that you can do it for medical reasons
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
but not cosmetic aesthetic or reasons of
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
convenience if you are mutilating an
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
animal for cosmetic or convenience that
 
03:52:56.450 --> 03:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
is cruelty it's a pretty clear line for
 
03:52:58.490 --> 03:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
me if you're doing a surgery for medical
 
03:53:00.410 --> 03:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
reasons so the animal can live in happy
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
and healthy life long term that's not
 
03:53:05.330 --> 03:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
cruelty but I do want to point out the
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
false uh equality that they they drew
 
03:53:11.210 --> 03:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
between sterilization and this
 
03:53:13.130 --> 03:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
particular thing when you undergo
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
sterilization when an animal does that
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
soft tissue you are not cutting through
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
bone you are not cutting through tendons
 
03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
you are not cutting through ligaments
 
03:53:23.450 --> 03:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
that is just soft tissue you're removing
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
an organ much like I've had my
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
gallbladder removed many of us have had
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
our wisdom teeth removed those in those
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
cases there are very rarely
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
complications long term and they are not
 
03:53:37.010 --> 03:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
intended for the surgery right but when
 
03:53:39.650 --> 03:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
the case of amputating the fingers the
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
ligaments the tendons and the bone in
 
03:53:45.290 --> 03:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
these cases and then the other the other
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to say is people aren't
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
forced to crawl around on their surgical
 
03:53:53.090 --> 03:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
wounds but a cat is forced to walk on
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
those surgical wounds to use the litter
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
box with those surgical wounds so yeah
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
there's a big big difference between
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
sterilization also people voluntarily
 
03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
undergo sterilization all the time so I
 
03:54:05.690 --> 03:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's necessarily
 
03:54:07.370 --> 03:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
true that any animal if we could ask
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
them would simply say no it's cruel to
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
continuing on I do want to point out
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 12 someone said oh this
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
must has to be limited to only vets and
 
03:54:22.370 --> 03:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
it says any person no it needs to be any
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
person if you do a quick Google Search
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
right now on your phone for at home
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
declaw kit they exist they are sold
 
03:54:33.410 --> 03:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
people do them at home often without any
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
sort of anesthesia and certainly not
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
putting them under like a general
 
03:54:40.130 --> 03:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
anesthesia like a doctor would do so
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it should be any person
 
03:54:42.720 --> 03:54:47.110 align:start position:0%
yeah it should be any person
foreign

03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.889 --> 03:54:48.899 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the idea is that therapeutic I think
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
the bells the bill spells it out really
 
03:54:55.130 --> 03:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
clearly but yes there are situations
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
when in which this is truly medically
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
therapeutic if the animal has cancer in
 
03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
the bone if the animal otherwise needs
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
to amputate has an injury or some
 
03:55:07.010 --> 03:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
deformity needs to amputate a finger
 
03:55:08.809 --> 03:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
that this is specifically how this is
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
written so that doctors can do it for
 
03:55:13.010 --> 03:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
medical medically legitimate reasons
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
again it's the line is when you mutilate
 
03:55:18.650 --> 03:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
an animal for cosmetic aesthetic or
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
reasons of convenience
 
03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
um like back to the idea of how many
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
vets do this do vets do this yeah 99.9
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
of the Vets don't do this the other 0.1
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
percent don't admit to it so then the
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
idea was how well how do we enforce it
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
if they're not admitting to it
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
um people tell
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
right nurses the front desk staff that
 
03:55:42.889 --> 03:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
see this people tell and that's how a
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
lot of crimes are actually enforced as
 
03:55:46.250 --> 03:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
people tell
 
03:55:49.130 --> 03:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh but there are vets like again there
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
are Bad actors everywhere this is why we
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
have laws there are vets that do bad
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
things that's why this is necessary my
 
03:55:58.090 --> 03:55:58.100 align:start position:0%
personal vet would never perform a a a
 
03:56:01.370 --> 03:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
declaw I asked him and actually I asked
 
03:56:03.530 --> 03:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
every single doctor in that office
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
but he told me a story of an owner a pet
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
owner I think it was a cat actually it
 
03:56:12.170 --> 03:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
turned out the cat was allergic to her
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
perfume and the vet my vet told her this
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know you have to stop wearing the
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
perfume around the cat and she said that
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
she wanted to put down the cat rather
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
than stop wearing her perfume he refused
 
03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
to do that but he knows that she went to
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
another vet who agreed to do it so there
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
are Bad actors and we legislate because
 
03:56:35.469 --> 03:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
of Bad actors
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing I want to bring up
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
is the opposition that you've heard over
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
the years on this bill is
 
03:56:48.650 --> 03:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
I'll say almost exclusively from the AKC
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
and dog groups they are afraid of the
 
03:56:53.630 --> 03:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
slippery slope because if we do this for
 
03:56:56.769 --> 03:56:56.779 align:start position:0%
cats then the next step will be ear
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
cropping and tail docking but this bill
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
is about cats and declawing and I plead
 
03:57:06.410 --> 03:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
with this committee to consider this
 
03:57:09.050 --> 03:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
bill and not any potential future bills
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
about dogs but only the health of cats
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
and declawing and with that I'm happy to
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
03:57:21.170 --> 03:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much
 
03:57:23.410 --> 03:57:23.420 align:start position:0%
representative uh and I understand
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely right that we legislate for
 
03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
for Bad actors but in any case where we
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislate for Bad actors but we carve
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
out exceptions right we have to to
 
03:57:35.090 --> 03:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's Point have an
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism right we need to
 
03:57:39.170 --> 03:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
be able to decide who is a bad actor who
 
03:57:40.849 --> 03:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
is doing this for you can murder but you
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
can kill himself defense but you also
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate right so clearly in
 
03:57:48.530 --> 03:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
case so again my question is also do you
 
03:57:52.330 --> 03:57:52.340 align:start position:0%
have in mind as a co-sponsor a specific
 
03:57:55.370 --> 03:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
way that that mechanism would work so
 
03:57:57.889 --> 03:57:57.899 align:start position:0%
for example if it were a matter of on
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
the paperwork a veterinarian simply
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
saying yes you know I I determined that
 
03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
this was medically necessary that
 
03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
obviously is not a very effective
 
03:58:09.290 --> 03:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism so are do you have
 
03:58:11.929 --> 03:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
in mind other forms of for example
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
requirement of documentation in the case
 
03:58:17.330 --> 03:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
of veterinarian so that if a case comes
 
03:58:20.090 --> 03:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
up they can demonstrate the need thank
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's a good one so
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
like any other criminal case the
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
prosecution has to go and collect
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
evidence in a case such as this the idea
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
that a doctor is going to claim that
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
when perhaps a witness is reporting them
 
03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
saying that they performed a cosmetic
 
03:58:39.290 --> 03:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
only declaw and the veterinarian would
 
03:58:41.809 --> 03:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
claim oh it was for medical reasons then
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
in that case a prosecutor could for
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
example go to the board and ask them for
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
a determination on whether that was
 
03:58:50.450 --> 03:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
medically necessary or not according to
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
the medical records that would be one
 
03:58:56.650 --> 03:58:56.660 align:start position:0%
sort of uh you can also call in court
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
Specialists Court experts into such a
 
03:59:01.969 --> 03:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
court case and ask them to in their
 
03:59:04.130 --> 03:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
medical opinion tell whether or not that
 
03:59:05.689 --> 03:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
was medically necessary or done for
 
03:59:07.969 --> 03:59:07.979 align:start position:0%
cosmetic reasons
 
03:59:09.530 --> 03:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you madam
 
03:59:09.540 --> 03:59:10.790 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you madam
chair

03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
your questions representative Murray
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned this is you're teaching me
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
something new about the at-home decline
 
03:59:26.450 --> 03:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
what what rates of instance or do you
 
03:59:28.610 --> 03:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
have any information or data for us on
 
03:59:30.530 --> 03:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
that other than a quick Google search
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
like do you know to what I don't have
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
any and I don't know how one would go
 
03:59:38.450 --> 03:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
about finding that information it's not
 
03:59:40.490 --> 03:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
like there's an agency in New Hampshire
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
that registers everyone who bought a
 
03:59:46.490 --> 03:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
at-home d-clock hit online like note the
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
state doesn't know what you buy online
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
of any type not just uh cat declaw kits
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I would have and we have no way of
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that but again like with all
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
crimes that are most crimes are done
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
intended to be done in private and then
 
04:00:02.570 --> 04:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
someone somewhere knows something and
 
04:00:06.170 --> 04:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
goes to law enforcement
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
so I have a follow-up question to that
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
if we banned decline in this state
 
04:00:15.370 --> 04:00:15.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that push people to do things
 
04:00:19.610 --> 04:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
illegally a purchase a a at home declaw
 
04:00:22.729 --> 04:00:22.739 align:start position:0%
kit and then cause even more damage to
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
their to the animals well as we've
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
already said 99.9 percent of vets don't
 
04:00:30.650 --> 04:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
do this so by and large if someone's
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to a vet asking for a cosmetic
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
declaw they're being told no which means
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
if they're very serious about it they
 
04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
may already be buying those kits all
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're doing is making that behavior
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
illegal the behavior that and again
 
04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a small number of
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
people a small number of people murder
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
but we still make laws for it because
 
04:00:50.929 --> 04:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
it's wrong so what we're saying is now
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
we have an enforcement mechanism because
 
04:00:55.610 --> 04:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
what you've been doing is cruel and now
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
we can go after you for it because at
 
04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
the moment we cannot
 
04:01:02.570 --> 04:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you madam
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
you see the red light so there you go I
 
04:01:22.729 --> 04:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
did it right
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
all right well um thank you committee
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak in front of you
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
today my name is Jane Varla Roy I am a
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian here in the Concord area
 
04:01:34.969 --> 04:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I have been practicing veterinary
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
medicine since 2006.
 
04:01:37.560 --> 04:01:38.170 align:start position:0%
medicine since 2006.
um

04:01:38.170 --> 04:01:38.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:40.729 --> 04:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
and I've been here in New Hampshire the
 
04:01:43.490 --> 04:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
entire time I am currently representing
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterinary Medical
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
Association in front of you today I also
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire at the American
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical association's House
 
04:01:54.889 --> 04:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
of delegates so I guess I'm representing
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
both the avma and the New Hampshire VMA
 
04:01:59.929 --> 04:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of not really sure where to
 
04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of not really sure where to
begin

04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
begin
 
04:02:04.490 --> 04:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
um because like many others that have
 
04:02:06.170 --> 04:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
come before me we have testified several
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
times and so right now I have a lot of
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
things spitting
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um in my head but I guess I'll just
 
04:02:12.889 --> 04:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
start with
 
04:02:14.269 --> 04:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
things that have already been kind of
 
04:02:14.279 --> 04:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
things that have already been kind of
said

04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um the avma does not support routine
 
04:02:20.090 --> 04:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
decline they have a position statement
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
that is readily available if you go
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
online you can read that for yourself I
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
can get that for you if you would like
 
04:02:28.370 --> 04:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
the that language but it does
 
04:02:30.050 --> 04:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
specifically state that they do not
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
support legislating it so we do not
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
support it as an association but we do
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
not support legislating and making it
 
04:02:41.210 --> 04:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
illegal as well and that is definitely
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
something across the board without other
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
Allied organizations they stop short as
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
as far as creating legislation regarding
 
04:02:49.080 --> 04:02:50.929 align:start position:0%
as far as creating legislation regarding
decline

04:02:50.929 --> 04:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
decline
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire VMA is also actively
 
04:02:55.610 --> 04:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
discouraging the practice with our
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and we have
 
04:03:00.290 --> 04:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
um sent out over the last few years
 
04:03:03.889 --> 04:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of surveys to get what the
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterinarians are
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
participating in we only represent about
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
400 veterinarians in the state this is a
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
member LED we do are separate from the
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the board certification of the board of
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine which represents
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
more of us so we do not have everybody's
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
opinion and to kind of address those
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
questions of how often we're doing it
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
we've tried to get those answers but
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
again we only can do what we get back
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
from our from our membership but it
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
isn't overwhelmingly no we do not
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
perform this procedure to the extent of
 
04:03:45.769 --> 04:03:45.779 align:start position:0%
of when we I even graduated in in 2006
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
it has something that has significantly
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
fallen off in the last 17 years that
 
04:03:52.750 --> 04:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
again I'll also comment I do not
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
remember in recent memory the last time
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
I did proceed perform a declaw procedure
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
it's at least seven to eight years could
 
04:04:07.010 --> 04:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
be more but my my memory does not serve
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:12.720 --> 04:04:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um many of the private practices around
 
04:04:16.680 --> 04:04:17.630 align:start position:0%
um many of the private practices around
here

04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:04:17.640 --> 04:04:18.290 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
also have the ability to as a practice
 
04:04:23.689 --> 04:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
decide not to perform these declaw
 
04:04:23.699 --> 04:04:25.090 align:start position:0%
decide not to perform these declaw
procedures

04:04:25.090 --> 04:04:25.100 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
it was also brought up that many of the
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
corporates that are practicing here in
 
04:04:33.050 --> 04:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
the state have already banded at a at a
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
corporate level so this includes
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
Banfield VCA and and the like so I guess
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm reiterating that point
 
04:04:42.239 --> 04:04:45.710 align:start position:0%
I'm reiterating that point
um

04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.050 --> 04:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
I did have the opportunity as a last
 
04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
avma meeting back in January
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I had a chance to sit down with
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
students at the veterinary schools and
 
04:04:58.570 --> 04:04:58.580 align:start position:0%
I've talked to a Veterinary
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
clinicians that are at the teaching
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
level to kind of get a sense of what's
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
going on in in the Veterinary Schools
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
right now it is across the board pretty
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
much a non
 
04:05:10.319 --> 04:05:11.330 align:start position:0%
much a non
um

04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
something that's not being taught in
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools right now it is definitely
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that has lost favor at the
 
04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
school level the schools that do offer
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
it are offering it more at a
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
um what we would call a lunch and learn
 
04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
or something that they do on their own
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
private time not something that is part
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the the specific curriculum so I got
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
I think the big the big issue
 
04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about the
 
04:05:44.210 --> 04:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
privatization and it's a private matter
 
04:05:44.220 --> 04:05:44.929 align:start position:0%
privatization and it's a private matter
um

04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
I think veterinarians our ultimate goal
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
is to preserve the human animal Bond
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
that is the Crux of everything that we
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
do you get a pet you love a pet and it
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
is our job as veterinarians to take care
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
of that pet and make sure that they are
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
happy and healthy and living their best
 
04:06:03.840 --> 04:06:05.210 align:start position:0%
happy and healthy and living their best
lives

04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:06:05.220 --> 04:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
lives
um

04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
like I said we do not promote the
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
decline we we work with our clients if
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
they do bring it up
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
um we sometimes have to get explicit
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
about explaining what the procedure is
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times that's enough to
 
04:06:21.769 --> 04:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
deter somebody
 
04:06:24.290 --> 04:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
um but like that's already brought up we
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
do offer nail trimmings we teach clients
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
how to trim their cat's nails we also
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
provide the the claws the claw caps and
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
and things like that as well so we are
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
trying our best to deter and like I said
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
I think we're as a Veterinary profession
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've done a pretty good job at
 
04:06:47.450 --> 04:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
educating our clients um you know now
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
these days so that we aren't performing
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
this this procedure anymore
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I will take any questions that you
 
04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
guys have for me yes I have a question
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how often are people
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
successfully dissuaded from declawing
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
their cats when they request it from
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
their veterinarian
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
I can only speak for myself
 
04:07:11.150 --> 04:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I would say I've got 100 success rate
 
04:07:13.010 --> 04:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
because I have not performed the
 
04:07:16.250 --> 04:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
procedure in at least like I said seven
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
to eight years our practice as a whole
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a three doctor practice here in the
 
04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
Concord area I would consider ourselves
 
04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
pretty busy
 
04:07:23.160 --> 04:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
pretty busy
um

04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:27.530 --> 04:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
most of us are having pretty positive
 
04:07:30.239 --> 04:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
most of us are having pretty positive
conversations

04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
04:07:32.929 --> 04:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
um like I said about deterring because
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
they can get on the internet and you
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
know Google declaw and they see the
 
04:07:38.929 --> 04:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
explicit photos they see exactly what it
 
04:07:38.939 --> 04:07:39.710 align:start position:0%
explicit photos they see exactly what it
is

04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I think the mindset
 
04:07:43.250 --> 04:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
um has definitely changed in the last 17
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
years that I've been practicing about
 
04:07:47.210 --> 04:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
what it is it used to be Spady claw
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
nudity claw you know that was on the
 
04:07:50.450 --> 04:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
books you know and you just people just
 
04:07:51.889 --> 04:07:51.899 align:start position:0%
did it because they felt like it was
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
something that they that they did
 
04:07:55.429 --> 04:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
um that is definitely not the case
 
04:07:55.439 --> 04:07:56.389 align:start position:0%
um that is definitely not the case
anymore

04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
04:07:57.650 --> 04:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
um people are definitely asking
 
04:07:57.660 --> 04:07:58.910 align:start position:0%
um people are definitely asking
questions

04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
um they're definitely having those pause
 
04:08:01.260 --> 04:08:02.570 align:start position:0%
um they're definitely having those pause
moments

04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
moments
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and I can say even for the the
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
reasons of medically necessary
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
when I mention
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
amputating as a treatment option
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
they exhaust all the other options first
 
04:08:18.050 --> 04:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
so even in those medically necessary
 
04:08:18.060 --> 04:08:19.729 align:start position:0%
so even in those medically necessary
situations

04:08:19.729 --> 04:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:08:21.530 --> 04:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so it is definitely something that I
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
feel we've done a really good job of of
 
04:08:26.530 --> 04:08:26.540 align:start position:0%
client education thank you
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
04:08:31.610 --> 04:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if this bill
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
passes what harm does it do to
 
04:08:36.530 --> 04:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Professionals in the state of
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:39.720 --> 04:08:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
I think the harm to veterinarians
 
04:08:56.330 --> 04:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
more of an emotional harm because we are
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
always going to think is somebody going
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
to tell on us
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
is a client going to tell on us is your
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
neighbor going to tell on you is that
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
disgruntled front desk staff is that
 
04:09:12.290 --> 04:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
disgruntled technician is the practice
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
down the street that's comparing
 
04:09:16.849 --> 04:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
competing with you going to tell on you
 
04:09:19.370 --> 04:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
social media has not been friendly to
 
04:09:21.290 --> 04:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
the veterinary profession over the last
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
few years and I feel that
 
04:09:28.130 --> 04:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
we as a profession are constantly
 
04:09:31.010 --> 04:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the thick of things and even if it's
 
04:09:39.769 --> 04:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
by putting
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
a criminal penalty for something that we
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
may have to stop and think about what
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
consequences could be
 
04:09:55.800 --> 04:09:57.769 align:start position:0%
consequences could be
um

04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
I think that is the the biggest
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
thing that we're going to think about
 
04:10:06.050 --> 04:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
the biggest harm and so I have a
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:10:09.650 --> 04:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
04:10:12.650 --> 04:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
this being considered a barbaric and
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
cruel procedure to do
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
how it how would it be cruel and
 
04:10:17.520 --> 04:10:19.370 align:start position:0%
how it how would it be cruel and
barbaric

04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
barbaric
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
for one instance versus not cruel and
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
barbaric for none another instance I
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
mean if you
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
if you remove it up to you know the
 
04:10:30.359 --> 04:10:31.429 align:start position:0%
if you remove it up to you know the
knuckle

04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
knuckle
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's for therapeutic reasons or
 
04:10:35.929 --> 04:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
for not therapeutic reasons it's still
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
removing it up to the knuckle and you
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
still run the risk of maybe having a
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
bone fragment that's going to be a
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
pebble in their foot or some other issue
 
04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
so could you clarify how
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
one instance may be considered a better
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
reason than another try I will try
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
I I think the the thought that we're
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
doing declaws under no anesthesia or
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
pain medication is is kind of a
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
falsehood any medical procedure that
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing at a veterinarian's office
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
is is going to be
 
04:11:15.170 --> 04:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
um under the scrutiny of a standard of
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
care so there are a variety of different
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
kind of standard of cares that we have
 
04:11:21.849 --> 04:11:21.859 align:start position:0%
to in our in our Veterinary Practice Act
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
adhere to or we will be brought up
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
against the board of veterinary medicine
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
and so the thought that
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be barbaric and cruel to
 
04:11:37.010 --> 04:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
declaw versus amputating a limb
 
04:11:39.769 --> 04:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
um re versus removing an eye for a
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
different procedure there are different
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
ways that you can kind of make those
 
04:11:44.580 --> 04:11:46.370 align:start position:0%
ways that you can kind of make those
definitions

04:11:46.370 --> 04:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think as long as we are
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
adhering to what is accepted as a
 
04:11:54.110 --> 04:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Practice as that
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
standard of care
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're not going to necessarily be
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
accused of Cruelty because there's a
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
variety of other things that if you're
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
not doing the standard of care
 
04:12:05.760 --> 04:12:07.070 align:start position:0%
not doing the standard of care
um

04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
it can and you're not treating it
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately that could be considered
 
04:12:13.490 --> 04:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
cruel barbaric
 
04:12:15.530 --> 04:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I think part of it is is
 
04:12:17.809 --> 04:12:17.819 align:start position:0%
possibly a semantic issue
 
04:12:19.490 --> 04:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um a definition issue
 
04:12:19.500 --> 04:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
um a definition issue
so

04:12:22.370 --> 04:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
as long as you're adhering to those
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
those standard of care practices are
 
04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
there any other procedures that are
 
04:12:27.779 --> 04:12:28.910 align:start position:0%
there any other procedures that are
banned

04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
banned
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
that you as a veterinarian cannot
 
04:12:34.130 --> 04:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
perform in New Hampshire
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
not that I know of
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby
 
04:12:42.410 --> 04:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
so we heard testimony that uh there are
 
04:12:46.010 --> 04:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
at home declaw kits have you seen
 
04:12:48.650 --> 04:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
evidence of any animals coming into your
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
practice or heard from any other vets in
 
04:12:55.490 --> 04:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire about uh seeing animals to
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
whom this has been done by the home uh
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
by someone at home
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
as far as I have seen no
 
04:13:06.899 --> 04:13:07.550 align:start position:0%
as far as I have seen no
um

04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
I can't like I said I can't speak for
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.239 --> 04:13:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:13:20.450 --> 04:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
um just from your reaction I can tell
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
that you don't think that's a good idea
 
04:13:27.300 --> 04:13:28.610 align:start position:0%
that you don't think that's a good idea
no

04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
um because one of the biggest things
 
04:13:32.570 --> 04:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
that we had always heard about wanting
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
to declaw your cat was I can't trim the
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
cat's nails at home so in my opinion if
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
you can't trim your own cat's nails at
 
04:13:39.840 --> 04:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
you can't trim your own cat's nails at
home

04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
how on Earth are you going to declaw
 
04:13:45.170 --> 04:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
your cat's nails
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
art claws at home either I'm having a
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
hard time wrapping my head around that
 
04:13:50.520 --> 04:13:53.769 align:start position:0%
hard time wrapping my head around that
concept

04:13:53.769 --> 04:13:53.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:56.570 --> 04:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh just one point before I get to
 
04:13:59.570 --> 04:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative esophageitis uh I I just
 
04:14:02.809 --> 04:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
Googled that uh at home declaw cat kits
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they are gel caps you put on your
 
04:14:08.689 --> 04:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
cat's claws so anyway uh representative
 
04:14:08.699 --> 04:14:19.790 align:start position:0%
cat's claws so anyway uh representative
sophakitis

04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's a tricky number to
 
04:14:27.769 --> 04:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
kind of figure out the last we knew the
 
04:14:30.610 --> 04:14:30.620 align:start position:0%
board of veterinary medicine had around
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
900 licensed veterinarians in the state
 
04:14:35.330 --> 04:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that being said border
 
04:14:40.450 --> 04:14:40.460 align:start position:0%
towns and border cities will have dual
 
04:14:43.969 --> 04:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
mem certifications so you know
 
04:14:46.370 --> 04:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont Maine will have
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
both a New Hampshire license and a
 
04:14:50.110 --> 04:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont license
 
04:14:54.110 --> 04:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
in our membership we have or last year's
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
2022 we had 400 roughly 400 members but
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
like I said we are we're we're very
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to get those actual numbers of
 
04:15:04.370 --> 04:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
the veterinary practicing veterinarians
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
04:15:06.540 --> 04:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
here in the state
foreign

04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
germana thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:15:12.530 --> 04:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:15:14.330 --> 04:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to kind of reframe the the
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairwoman's question a little bit and
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
make it slightly more pointed I think
 
04:15:19.680 --> 04:15:20.450 align:start position:0%
make it slightly more pointed I think
um

04:15:20.450 --> 04:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill allows for exceptions
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
and therapeutic purposes right for
 
04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
medically necessary things that a vet
 
04:15:28.250 --> 04:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
determines to be medically necessary
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
given the impact uh over the life of the
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
animal not simply the procedure but the
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
possibility of developing arthritis uh
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know questions around if the cat is
 
04:15:42.170 --> 04:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
is uh less able to defend itself if it
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
should be outdoors Etc so uh given the
 
04:15:47.809 --> 04:15:47.819 align:start position:0%
possible impact over the life of the
 
04:15:51.769 --> 04:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
animal do would you say that declawing
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
for purely cosmetic or reasons or for
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasons of convenience is cruel if it's
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
if it's purely for cosmetic or reasons
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
of convenience in your opinion would
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.140 --> 04:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:16:15.170 --> 04:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
because there are reasons that have
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
already been stated about why somebody
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
would choose to declaw their cat and
 
04:16:22.680 --> 04:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
would choose to declaw their cat and
if

04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
the ultimate reason for choosing to
 
04:16:32.210 --> 04:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
declaw your cat is based on preserving
 
04:16:34.210 --> 04:16:34.220 align:start position:0%
yet human animal Bond
 
04:16:38.090 --> 04:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
then to me that's not a cruel decision
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
because there's no intent to
 
04:16:42.180 --> 04:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
because there's no intent to
harm

04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
harm
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
physically harm your cat in an
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
intentional way
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
um that's that that's not something that
 
04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
and you're not doing it like I said
 
04:16:53.689 --> 04:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
without anesthesia pain medication
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
um there are ways to mitigate
 
04:16:55.920 --> 04:16:57.349 align:start position:0%
um there are ways to mitigate
those

04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:16:57.359 --> 04:16:58.670 align:start position:0%
those
things

04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:17:00.050 --> 04:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and with any surgery there are
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
complications and so to use that as
 
04:17:03.300 --> 04:17:04.969 align:start position:0%
complications and so to use that as
um

04:17:04.969 --> 04:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
a reason too is is is not
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:17:11.570 --> 04:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
04:17:14.210 --> 04:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
chair representative Knapp thank you for
 
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
testifying thank you for taking my
 
04:17:17.450 --> 04:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
question can you just um clarify then
 
04:17:20.210 --> 04:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
why the avma recommended against this
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
procedure if it's
 
04:17:25.849 --> 04:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
not cruelty is it long-term side effects
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
is it I think it's there's there's from
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
what we
 
04:17:32.809 --> 04:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
from what we know is is
 
04:17:32.819 --> 04:17:34.610 align:start position:0%
from what we know is is
the

04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
Society has changed in their opinions on
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
things it is not something that is we're
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
finding a a necessity
 
04:17:46.370 --> 04:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
they have it in there to discourage
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
because there are other options
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and that ends up being you know the
 
04:17:55.490 --> 04:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision ends up being in the
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
the hands of the owner
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.250 --> 04:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
 
04:18:04.260 --> 04:18:06.710 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
coulon

04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
coulon
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:18:12.130 --> 04:18:12.140 align:start position:0%
your testimony today would you say that
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
education on this issue might be
 
04:18:18.729 --> 04:18:18.739 align:start position:0%
potentially more effective than
 
04:18:21.490 --> 04:18:21.500 align:start position:0%
legislation which potentially
 
04:18:21.500 --> 04:18:23.290 align:start position:0%
legislation which potentially
criminalizes

04:18:23.290 --> 04:18:23.300 align:start position:0%
criminalizes
 
04:18:27.410 --> 04:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
I think education has already shown to
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
be effective in her tailing decline
 
04:18:35.399 --> 04:18:38.090 align:start position:0%
be effective in her tailing decline
um

04:18:38.090 --> 04:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.050 --> 04:18:41.060 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are already practicing
 
04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
client education in in such a way and so
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
creating a law that criminalizes
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in this particular build
 
04:18:54.410 --> 04:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
without specifically saying
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
veterinarians you know we are still
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
targeting veterinarians specifically in
 
04:19:00.650 --> 04:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you the point of
 
04:19:04.370 --> 04:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
clarification sure the the bill if I'm
 
04:19:06.650 --> 04:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
correct is not about a criminal penalty
 
04:19:08.689 --> 04:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
correct it is uh it is a symbol I just
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
want us to be clear on
 
04:19:10.380 --> 04:19:11.030 align:start position:0%
want us to be clear on
um

04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
that we are not talking about
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
criminalization in a technical sense
 
04:19:17.210 --> 04:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
that this is a civil violation yes thank
 
04:19:19.490 --> 04:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
you madam chair but clarification you do
 
04:19:21.650 --> 04:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
have the analysis it says Bill creates a
 
04:19:24.170 --> 04:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty for decline cats so if
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative come to our question
 
04:19:37.969 --> 04:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and
 
04:19:40.849 --> 04:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:19:43.729 --> 04:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you have 400 uh
 
04:19:47.170 --> 04:19:47.180 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire
 
04:19:49.610 --> 04:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
a VMA
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
now we also have corporate uh clinics
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state are those
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians also a member of the New
 
04:20:01.729 --> 04:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire VMA
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:20:05.929 --> 04:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you thank you madam
 
04:20:05.939 --> 04:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you thank you madam
chair

04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:20:10.370 --> 04:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and how many of those veterinarians
 
04:20:13.010 --> 04:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
do those corporations employ would you
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
in in your estimation
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I would say most of the multi-doctor
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
practices here in the state are
 
04:20:24.250 --> 04:20:24.260 align:start position:0%
corporate owned as a general statement
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
04:20:30.370 --> 04:20:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
you pay for your membership and so most
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the benefits packages for these
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
corporations include a
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money that you spend on your
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
continuing education your membership
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
dues association dues and such and so it
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
is up to the individual veterinarian
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
what they spend that money on so in a
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
corporate practice not all veterinarians
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
maybe avma members not all all
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
veterinarians maybe New Hampshire VMA
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
members it's it's their personal
 
04:21:02.340 --> 04:21:05.150 align:start position:0%
members it's it's their personal
decision

04:21:05.150 --> 04:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh one more follow-up thank you madam
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
chair thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
you again
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
um do you know
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I think we talked about how many
 
04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
veterinarians were with the corporate
 
04:21:16.450 --> 04:21:16.460 align:start position:0%
practice how many
 
04:21:19.250 --> 04:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
companies are involved in corporate
 
04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
um or what are the major ones how many
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
major that you know of the major ones
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
that I know of
 
04:21:31.010 --> 04:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
um are the ones that have the major
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
signage so a VCA hospital will have VCA
 
04:21:36.650 --> 04:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
whatever Banfield will have their
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
corporation but we do have a structure
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
in veterinary medicine here in the state
 
04:21:41.640 --> 04:21:43.370 align:start position:0%
in veterinary medicine here in the state
that

04:21:43.370 --> 04:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:43.380 --> 04:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:46.250 --> 04:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
they're more like silent corporations so
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
your Veterinary practice may be a
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
corporate Veterinary practice but
 
04:21:52.250 --> 04:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're retaining the name of their
 
04:21:55.130 --> 04:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
private practice beforehand so XYZ
 
04:21:57.410 --> 04:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
Animal Hospital might have been bought
 
04:22:00.170 --> 04:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
out by a corporate but
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
they're the corporate management has
 
04:22:06.110 --> 04:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
one more thank you madam chair
 
04:22:08.819 --> 04:22:10.130 align:start position:0%
one more thank you madam chair
so

04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
in hearing the testimony these major
 
04:22:15.410 --> 04:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
these corporations have banned the
 
04:22:17.450 --> 04:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
practice of declaring is that my is that
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
correct could I do not work for a
 
04:22:22.490 --> 04:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
corporate I work for a private practice
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
um if but if that's what is being said
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
um most corporations have standard
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
operating procedures in place they have
 
04:22:32.090 --> 04:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
a corporate structure
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
um that's on the national level and you
 
04:22:35.809 --> 04:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
follow that National
 
04:22:35.819 --> 04:22:37.729 align:start position:0%

local groomer in the summer the dog was

groomed its fur was blown dry and the

dog was left in a plastic crate
 
04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
the groomer then left the building to
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
run an errand when the groomer returned
 
04:38:47.330 --> 04:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
the dog was dead from heat exhaustion
 
04:38:49.010 --> 04:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
should a groomer be allowed to leave a
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
client in such a condition a study May
 
04:38:54.051 --> 04:38:54.061 align:start position:0%
answer this and many other many other

04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
goal and one that I am sure can be
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
completed in a timely fashion please
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
find HB 37 ought to pass and we will get
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
you get to work thank you for your time
 
04:39:16.609 --> 04:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
and attention and of course I will be
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions and move to
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
Executive session to go vote this ought

04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
that was a big laugh
 
04:39:27.279 --> 04:39:29.709 align:start position:0%
that was a big laugh
[Laughter]

04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%

04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I have a question that the terrible
 
04:39:38.090 --> 04:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
tragedy for of course the pet and the
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
pet owner in that case of Teddy and
 
04:39:42.190 --> 04:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
probably you know a handful of other
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
some other animals as well
 
04:39:48.170 --> 04:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
were their lawsuits against uh the pet
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
groomer as a result of this and do you
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
know what happened with that particular
 
04:39:52.920 --> 04:39:54.110 align:start position:0%
know what happened with that particular
instances

04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
instances
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the question
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question I can only
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
speak to this one case that I know that
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
happened with Teddy because there was no
 
04:40:05.630 --> 04:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
standard for the care a lawsuit did
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
ensue and the question became did the
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
dog come in already exhausted because it
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
had been at the beach and it was the
 
04:40:15.050 --> 04:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
summer time
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
had that condition if it existed been
 
04:40:21.288 --> 04:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by being left in a crate and
 
04:40:22.730 --> 04:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
blown dry
 
04:40:25.850 --> 04:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
there was no lawyers could not figure
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
out how to answer that question so what
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately happened is the groomer the
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
groomer was forced out of business
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
because of the horrible negative
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
publicity there was absolutely no
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
accountability on either side we were
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
left with a business that well we were
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
left with somebody who went out of
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
business and no longer does what she had
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
been trained to do for a long time and a
 
04:40:50.690 --> 04:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
dead dog so the answer to your question
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
is in this one instance there was an
 
04:40:54.170 --> 04:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
attempt to at least get to
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
accountability with no resolution thank
 
04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
you and I also have another question
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
insofar as
 
04:41:00.480 --> 04:41:02.630 align:start position:0%
insofar as
so

04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:05.630 --> 04:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
so ostensively these groomers do go for
 
04:41:09.170 --> 04:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
training and education and there are
 
04:41:11.448 --> 04:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
04:41:11.458 --> 04:41:12.288 align:start position:0%
organizations that
um

04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
that that support
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
these groomers and and what they do do
 
04:41:22.010 --> 04:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
these organizations not have some sort
 
04:41:25.570 --> 04:41:25.580 align:start position:0%
of same course of training that they
 
04:41:28.128 --> 04:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
disseminate again thank you for the
 
04:41:30.490 --> 04:41:30.500 align:start position:0%
question to the best of my research
 
04:41:35.448 --> 04:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
no one standard exists and that I will
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
say may be odd to answer this way maybe
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's the right course because there is
 
04:41:43.368 --> 04:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
not a single state in the Union that has
 
04:41:45.530 --> 04:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
any type of Licensing and there is no
 
04:41:47.810 --> 04:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
one general standard that we're going to
 
04:41:51.288 --> 04:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
and if maybe that is the answer but the
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
question is now in these instances and I
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
will say there are maybe there there
 
04:41:57.530 --> 04:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
were upwards of seven to eight cases
 
04:42:00.368 --> 04:42:00.378 align:start position:0%
like this per year in in our state alone
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's left people with the question of
 
04:42:05.570 --> 04:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
what was I supposed to do what could I
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
do what happened what were you supposed
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do groomer for my animal and without
 
04:42:13.368 --> 04:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
that standard of care we're again left
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
without any answers so I have not found
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a standard that that can
 
04:42:20.208 --> 04:42:20.218 align:start position:0%
be applied universally
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative kantois
 
04:42:25.610 --> 04:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
um I did a quick search on certification
 
04:42:32.690 --> 04:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
programs for groomers
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and the cost is
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
pretty high for entry we're talking tens
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars really to be uh
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
to go to these uh schools which would
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
prohibit a lot of people that currently
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
are groomers from entering the field at
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
how would you address that situation due
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
to the cost and the entry and and the
 
04:43:02.090 --> 04:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
second question is is it seems to me
 
04:43:02.100 --> 04:43:04.368 align:start position:0%
second question is is it seems to me
that

04:43:04.368 --> 04:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:06.530 --> 04:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
most people go to a groomer based on
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth
 
04:43:08.040 --> 04:43:08.628 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth
um

04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:08.638 --> 04:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:12.590 --> 04:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
that the market is truly working that
 
04:43:16.490 --> 04:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
way and why is that not a good thing
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for both of those
 
04:43:21.288 --> 04:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
questions the the effort to become
 
04:43:21.298 --> 04:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
questions the the effort to become
certified

04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
um definitely takes time effort and
 
04:43:25.378 --> 04:43:26.750 align:start position:0%
um definitely takes time effort and
money

04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:43:28.730 --> 04:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't disagree with that at
 
04:43:30.770 --> 04:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
all in order to go into business any
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
business does take again those three
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
elements time effort and certainly uh
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
the money to keep that commitment and I
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
don't think that I I don't want to
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
assume in any way that there should be
 
04:43:45.368 --> 04:43:45.378 align:start position:0%
any additional costs
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
involved or or placed on that applicant
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'll use that word
 
04:43:54.410 --> 04:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
um to get the standard it I just I just
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
wonder if there should be a standard for
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
which the these these certification
 
04:44:01.730 --> 04:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
organizations are operating I wonder
 
04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
that and I and I can't so I don't know
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
that I can answer specifically
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
to your second question though and I'll
 
04:44:10.010 --> 04:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
use me as an example
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
um I've been going to one groomer for
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the longest time she does a great job
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
with my dog a new one opened in my town
 
04:44:18.288 --> 04:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
I thought support the local folks and go
 
04:44:18.298 --> 04:44:19.250 align:start position:0%
I thought support the local folks and go
in

04:44:19.250 --> 04:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
my dog came out completely differently
 
04:44:25.010 --> 04:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and his nails were not were not done
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
as well and in fact he was hurt uh in
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
one of in one of those nails so I think
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
the mark of course the market regulates
 
04:44:32.878 --> 04:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
the mark of course the market regulates
itself

04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so I I not not sure that I have an
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
answer so much that I agree with you
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
that that maybe that's what might have
 
04:44:42.530 --> 04:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
04:44:44.810 --> 04:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
but I think it should be studied
 
04:44:47.570 --> 04:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes thank you for
 
04:44:49.730 --> 04:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
04:44:49.740 --> 04:44:51.050 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
um

04:44:51.050 --> 04:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh one of the questions that
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
seems to be coming up is uh
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
the egg there are existing organizations
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
that do certification and it takes a lot
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
of money to uh to go through that not
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
every competent groomer out there has
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily gone through one gone
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
through one of these and it seems like
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the standard of your
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
standard of care you're talking about
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
could be established without having to
 
04:45:20.160 --> 04:45:21.670 align:start position:0%
could be established without having to
necessarily

04:45:21.670 --> 04:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:45:25.368 --> 04:45:25.378 align:start position:0%
buy into one of the these more expensive
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
programs is that something you expect to
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
study would your study committee would
 
04:45:30.650 --> 04:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
be looking into
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the uh the question
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative and I think you bring up
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
an excellent point maybe the study
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
committee looks at just
 
04:45:42.050 --> 04:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
um maybe a resolution or a result of the
 
04:45:44.570 --> 04:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
study committee is that a groomer need
 
04:45:46.810 --> 04:45:46.820 align:start position:0%
only be certified
 
04:45:50.090 --> 04:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
by and maybe list the organizations and
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
not have a certain standard and because
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are some baseline
 
04:45:58.190 --> 04:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
standards that that are out there so
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
put on your microphone please there are
 
04:46:15.050 --> 04:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
so many different breeds of dogs
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
and price point of dogs and standards of
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
grooming of dogs and I guess my question
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.150 --> 04:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
um like I'm a nurse a registered nurse
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
and like all nurses have to know how to
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
do CPR and all nurses have to know how a
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
special safety measures so what would
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
you think of something like that
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
something blanket in terms of you know
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
safety practices not necessarily like
 
04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
breed specific but safety practices for
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
the business
 
04:46:55.550 --> 04:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for the question I think
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
that would be an excellent point to
 
04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
raise for this committee again I'll use
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
the word maybe overuse the word should
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
there be a baseline for which these
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
groomers need to meet one in which would
 
04:47:14.350 --> 04:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
be automatically or or inherently
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
contained within their certification I
 
04:47:18.170 --> 04:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
think that would be an excellent point
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
to raise
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you representative for
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question so one question that
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
I did have is I'm looking at the charge
 
04:47:29.570 --> 04:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
of the study committee and it's quite
 
04:47:32.448 --> 04:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
broad it encompasses a lot of things so
 
04:47:34.250 --> 04:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
I and I guess more to representative
 
04:47:34.260 --> 04:47:35.750 align:start position:0%
I and I guess more to representative
suffolkitis's

04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
suffolkitis's
 
04:47:35.760 --> 04:47:36.770 align:start position:0%
suffolkitis's
um

04:47:36.770 --> 04:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
point I I'm wondering how
 
04:47:42.050 --> 04:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
do you think that you will have an
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of time to delve into
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:53.690 --> 04:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
would it be more efficient to look at a
 
04:47:55.730 --> 04:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
more narrow area like best practices and
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
safety measures or do you feel that the
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
charge is appropriate
 
04:48:01.610 --> 04:48:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:48:01.620 --> 04:48:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

04:48:03.470 --> 04:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.610 --> 04:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
thinking on the Fly maybe an amendment
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
to to try to Pare this down wouldn't be
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
the worst thing but I'd have to think
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit more to figure
 
04:48:23.208 --> 04:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
out uh to really look at where have been
 
04:48:26.810 --> 04:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
the the pros and cons in other states
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and what have they found with regard to
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
any of the issues that we have raised
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
but I would not be opposed
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
I would not be opposed in the interest
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
of time to maybe finding that my word
 
04:48:38.638 --> 04:48:41.868 align:start position:0%
of time to maybe finding that my word
Baseline

04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.128 --> 04:48:45.138 align:start position:0%
um I have a question in so far as
 
04:48:48.288 --> 04:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
this bill mentions three members of the
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives one member of
 
04:48:51.730 --> 04:48:51.740 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
these these folks to me don't really
 
04:48:57.410 --> 04:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
have the
 
04:48:57.420 --> 04:48:58.610 align:start position:0%
have the
um

04:48:58.610 --> 04:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
occupational knowledge
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
to really look into these things as well
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
as perhaps members of the organizations
 
04:49:10.550 --> 04:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
that do the certifications and so forth
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it almost seems to me that it would
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
be more effective to have
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
kind of have their own study committee
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
to come up with
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
the the answers to your questions I mean
 
04:49:30.170 --> 04:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm I'm thinking that you're
 
04:49:31.730 --> 04:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
almost looking for
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
the wrong group of people to come up
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
with the answers what are your thoughts
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
on that thank you thank you for the
 
04:49:42.530 --> 04:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
question another interesting point I I
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
will say with a smile if if I am
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
appointed to this if this does pass and
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm appointed to it I plan on having an
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
open house and bringing everybody in uh
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
bring every party in that might be able
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
to lend lend information here to help us
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
come up with a conclusion
 
04:50:03.650 --> 04:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
um but maybe that's not the right
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
approach maybe the approach is is if you
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing you correctly
 
04:50:10.250 --> 04:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing you correctly although I
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't know how it would happen is turn
 
04:50:15.890 --> 04:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
this around to the industry itself and
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
and try to have the industry itself come
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
up with that I'm just not sure how I
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:50:26.930 --> 04:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know maybe bad word use a hamster
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
wheel to you know try to figure out
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
which one of us is going to come up with
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
the standard but your your point is well
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
taken yeah representative Murray
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
um just a a point I I do think that uh
 
04:50:41.090 --> 04:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
question rather Madam chair thank you
 
04:50:42.288 --> 04:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I I understand your point about
 
04:50:46.490 --> 04:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
getting stakeholders and groups of
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
interested parties to the table it
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like your preference for a
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
study committee might give you some more
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
flexibility versus a commission which
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
may be harder to convene folks
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
so it are you looking at a you're
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking at your preference would be a
 
04:51:03.890 --> 04:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
study committee is that what I'm hearing
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
 
04:51:09.650 --> 04:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
answer is yes and because that was also
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
what I heard coming out of a Commerce
 
04:51:15.470 --> 04:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
Committee last year is that a smaller
 
04:51:18.530 --> 04:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
more focused group and I think chair and
 
04:51:20.330 --> 04:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
Mike go to your point a smaller more
 
04:51:22.610 --> 04:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
focused group might be more effective
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
and be able to get a report out uh by
 
04:51:27.490 --> 04:51:27.500 align:start position:0%
the I think it's November timeline
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
rather than but might be the right point
 
04:51:33.288 --> 04:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
a commission which would be extensive
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
and large and bring in all of those
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to be quite honest I think
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
the committee again to say the committee
 
04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
would be inviting all of the people who
 
04:51:45.050 --> 04:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
might otherwise have been on the
 
04:51:45.060 --> 04:51:47.230 align:start position:0%
might otherwise have been on the
commission

04:51:47.230 --> 04:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative nebb thank you madam
 
04:51:51.530 --> 04:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
chair I think you may have just answered
 
04:51:52.910 --> 04:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
the question I was going to ask but what
 
04:51:54.050 --> 04:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
were the concerns of the Commerce
 
04:51:55.850 --> 04:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
Committee were there other ones besides
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the size of the
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
um commission there was one other one
 
04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
which uh which I I will say that I I am
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
empathetic to is and that is a concern
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
about licensure concern about creating
 
04:52:11.570 --> 04:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
another layer of government uh to do
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
something and I will state as a
 
04:52:15.650 --> 04:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
principled point for myself I'm not
 
04:52:17.868 --> 04:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
looking to add to government I'm not
 
04:52:20.090 --> 04:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
looking to complicate it and certainly
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
do not want to add an onerous burden uh
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
by way of cost upward cost pressure to
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
anybody but that was a concern that that
 
04:52:32.330 --> 04:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
level of licensure and then to to add to
 
04:52:34.128 --> 04:52:34.138 align:start position:0%
that there has not been one state in the
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
Union had that has passed a license for
 
04:52:38.810 --> 04:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
dog groomers so I think that might I
 
04:52:40.490 --> 04:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's an answer
 
04:52:40.500 --> 04:52:42.110 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's an answer
licensure

04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me as if the committee that
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting might come up with
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
more appropriate questions to ask the
 
04:52:51.660 --> 04:52:53.330 align:start position:0%
more appropriate questions to ask the
professional

04:52:53.330 --> 04:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:52:55.550 --> 04:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
um a collection of people in the
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
profession including maybe even the
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
Humane Society and and you know
 
04:53:02.270 --> 04:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
advocates for pets and and animals
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
um so so if you were to convene this
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee it seems like it would be at
 
04:53:07.610 --> 04:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
the beginning of an investigation that
 
04:53:08.810 --> 04:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
would be taken to the next level
 
04:53:12.170 --> 04:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
possibly with Professionals in that area
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and and I
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
agree and would would hope though that
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
the report because we'd have to file the
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
report would would be would get us down
 
04:53:25.368 --> 04:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
the road I I would really resist
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
anything that was so open-ended that we
 
04:53:29.690 --> 04:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
left saying you know we've only we've
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
barely passed go on this but but I do I
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
I do agree with you representative Dotsy
 
04:53:38.208 --> 04:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I S I thought I
 
04:53:43.368 --> 04:53:43.378 align:start position:0%
remembered during the last hearing that
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
there was a professional association of
 
04:53:50.830 --> 04:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
groomers or a quasi professional
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
association that wanted
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know to become more active do you
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
remember anything like that in go in
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't I
 
04:54:07.850 --> 04:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
remember I remember one of the witnesses
 
04:54:09.890 --> 04:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
who testified
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
speaking to her speaking to her
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
involvement in specific organ in a
 
04:54:18.650 --> 04:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
specific organization but I don't
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
remember them being there shame on me I
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
apologize but I will make a note to go
 
04:54:24.650 --> 04:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
back into that testimony and look
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
without the hearing and look
 
04:54:29.690 --> 04:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.770 --> 04:54:35.780 align:start position:0%
uh study committees before in the past
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
and one question that sometimes comes up
 
04:54:41.690 --> 04:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
is why not just put it in a bill why do
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
why do you need to study the committee
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
when you could just like write a bill
 
04:54:44.280 --> 04:54:45.288 align:start position:0%
when you could just like write a bill
yourself

04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that's necessarily
 
04:54:49.850 --> 04:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
my take but I just would like to see
 
04:54:52.810 --> 04:54:52.820 align:start position:0%
what you how you respond to that
 
04:54:56.510 --> 04:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and and the
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
first the first request of me and might
 
04:55:02.930 --> 04:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
have been again born out of the tragedy
 
04:55:07.250 --> 04:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
was we need to license dog groomers as a
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
way of of imposing some control and I
 
04:55:13.550 --> 04:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
was not supportive of and again born out
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
of tragedy because there was no
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
resolution to for for that one
 
04:55:18.650 --> 04:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
individual and I was not supportive of
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
the idea of a license but said I think
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
we need to look at what what kind of
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
standard exists uh because of what
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
happens which is why I of what I'm
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
starting to hear now is
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a bill to create a baseline isn't
 
04:55:38.170 --> 04:55:38.180 align:start position:0%
the worst idea and a really simple
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
baseline from which oops from which we
 
04:55:45.530 --> 04:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
can springboard into health concerns but
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.610 --> 04:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
tour thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
um and I'm gonna bounce off what
 
04:55:59.410 --> 04:55:59.420 align:start position:0%
something that represents dutse spoke of
 
04:56:02.208 --> 04:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
we discussed the last time we heard this
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
bill something similar to this is that
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
the groomers themselves should form the
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
organization and come up with their own
 
04:56:11.810 --> 04:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
standard of care because they're the
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
ones inherently
 
04:56:16.770 --> 04:56:16.780 align:start position:0%
that it affects the most
 
04:56:16.780 --> 04:56:18.110 align:start position:0%
that it affects the most
[Music]

04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
have you spoken to anyone to see if they
 
04:56:22.368 --> 04:56:22.378 align:start position:0%
have done that
 
04:56:22.378 --> 04:56:23.810 align:start position:0%
have done that
and

04:56:23.810 --> 04:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
we know that like the AKC has their own
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
certification for people that come into
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
the state to groom these dogs and they
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
have a certain standard that they follow
 
04:56:35.090 --> 04:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
have you looked at that at all
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
 
04:56:39.550 --> 04:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
answer to the first question is
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
I was asked by a person who was involved
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
in that who said
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
we would rather excuse me way is the
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
wrong word that person would rather have
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
had this come from the state to set the
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
standard rather than run the risk of
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
having a patchwork of Standards which is
 
04:57:02.810 --> 04:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
why I which is why I took this approach
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
of of making it a little bit more broad
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
to figure out but once again and I think
 
04:57:09.650 --> 04:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
this goes back to a question that you
 
04:57:11.930 --> 04:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
asked I would not be opposed to this to
 
04:57:14.208 --> 04:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
the industry setting that standard I
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
think for a point that was that was
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
brought up before a cat is different
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
from a dog is different from a and by
 
04:57:23.708 --> 04:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
the way just kind of tangentially that
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
1430 organizations that take care of
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
pets is as is is enormously Broad and it
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
does not mean that that's 1430 dog
 
04:57:37.970 --> 04:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
groomers or pet groomers in the state
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
um so maybe maybe parse or maybe a
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
finding how we can break up that the the
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
the numbers to a more manageable number
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
to say okay pet dog groomers need to
 
04:57:52.368 --> 04:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
meet this standard cat groomers this
 
04:57:53.448 --> 04:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
standard and I don't know if that can
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
happen I truly don't know that that can
 
04:57:59.690 --> 04:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.890 --> 04:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
oh um so just to follow up you said this
 
04:58:09.890 --> 04:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
was brought you spoke with a groomer how
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
many groomers have
 
04:58:12.890 --> 04:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
are there in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
and how many have actually asked for
 
04:58:15.360 --> 04:58:16.550 align:start position:0%
and how many have actually asked for
this

04:58:16.550 --> 04:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
great question and again going to BLS
 
04:58:21.230 --> 04:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
for that Bureau of Labor and statistics
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh that number was broad was 1430 uh
 
04:58:28.368 --> 04:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
that that's how it's broken out for oh
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
my gosh now I can't remember the exact
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
term that's listed in BLS I apologize I
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
can follow up with the committee on on
 
04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
that exact term but that was the number
 
04:58:39.530 --> 04:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh that was given and how many did I
 
04:58:42.050 --> 04:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
speak with initially it came to me from
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
two individuals locally since then I
 
04:58:48.288 --> 04:58:48.298 align:start position:0%
have brought it up myself uh to both of
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
the groomers that I go to to ask them
 
04:58:54.050 --> 04:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
about what they had to do for their to
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
open their business and what standards
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
they they abide by one of which has a
 
04:59:01.610 --> 04:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
wall full of certifications it's quite
 
04:59:01.620 --> 04:59:03.350 align:start position:0%
wall full of certifications it's quite
amazing

04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
04:59:05.570 --> 04:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp thank you madam
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
chair I wonder if you have any sense of
 
04:59:08.570 --> 04:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
like the growth of the grooming industry
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
over the last few years because it does
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
feel like grooming's super expensive I
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
can say from personal experience and
 
04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
hard to get into so I feel like there's
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
more and more groomers popping up I
 
04:59:20.570 --> 04:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any data behind
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
that I can provide that data to you and
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
while I haven't committed it to memory
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
it is actually a growing industry
 
04:59:31.368 --> 04:59:31.378 align:start position:0%
although the the average annual income
 
04:59:33.650 --> 04:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
might be what we would consider to be
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
lower it's in you know the 20s to twenty
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
to fifty thousand dollars uh that these
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
folks are making
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
um but it is a growing industry in the
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
state and I and I will do that research
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I can send that to com the committee
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh on anything that I can find on hard
 
04:59:48.958 --> 04:59:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh on anything that I can find on hard
numbers

04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:59:55.080 --> 04:59:56.330 align:start position:0%
any other questions
okay

04:59:56.330 --> 04:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:56.340 --> 04:59:57.170 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:59:57.170 --> 04:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:00.350 --> 05:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know for me personally I I'm I'm
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
puzzled I haven't seen any rumors or
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
from the industry here today to they
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
don't like me
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
to ask for this uh this kind of
 
05:00:12.240 --> 05:00:13.208 align:start position:0%
to ask for this uh this kind of
um

05:00:13.208 --> 05:00:13.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:13.218 --> 05:00:14.770 align:start position:0%
um
legislation

05:00:14.770 --> 05:00:14.780 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
nor have I seen anything really uh on
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
the portal indicating that you know
 
05:00:24.530 --> 05:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
people are are seeking this kind of
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
thing to happen and I wonder too uh if
 
05:00:30.770 --> 05:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
if there would be any kind of means for
 
05:00:34.010 --> 05:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
you maybe to attend one of the groomer
 
05:00:37.010 --> 05:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
Expos or something and present a
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
workshop of some sort uh polling people
 
05:00:43.490 --> 05:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
are asking people for you know what
 
05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
their what their thoughts are on on
 
05:00:47.690 --> 05:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
standardizing things throughout their
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
industry uh any comment on that I do
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
 
05:00:54.410 --> 05:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
thought one of the things I thought that
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
I would take upon myself is as I would
 
05:00:58.250 --> 05:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
do at the planning board is go on a
 
05:01:00.650 --> 05:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
sidewalk you know to use that to go to a
 
05:01:02.208 --> 05:01:02.218 align:start position:0%
trade show
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
um and and see what happens there and I
 
05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I did think taking that upon myself
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
but to your first point about not as
 
05:01:12.170 --> 05:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
many folks being here I I had hoped I I
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
had reached out to the people who had
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
testified last time they all had prior
 
05:01:16.798 --> 05:01:18.170 align:start position:0%
testified last time they all had prior
commitments

05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I can't speak to anybody else I
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
was I was hoping the room would be full
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
and we'd be here until nine o'clock at
 
05:01:23.638 --> 05:01:30.250 align:start position:0%
and we'd be here until nine o'clock at
night

05:01:30.250 --> 05:01:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:33.890 --> 05:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
I don't represent him NAB
 
05:01:36.410 --> 05:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
sure okay um from the opposite direction
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
like we had a testimony earlier from the
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
dog owners of the Granite State I wonder
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
if their what their position on
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
something like this would be because
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
people don't naturally want to say I'd
 
05:01:47.868 --> 05:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
like more regulation my industry they
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
might if it makes them look stronger but
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
I wonder if a contingent of dog owner is
 
05:01:55.128 --> 05:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
what they think about it well we did get
 
05:01:57.770 --> 05:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
testimony from the AKC
 
05:01:57.780 --> 05:01:59.330 align:start position:0%
testimony from the AKC
okay

05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.128 --> 05:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
her testimony indicated that
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
um they are they teach uh they have
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
course on learning groomer and Salon
 
05:02:21.410 --> 05:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
safety protocols being informed about
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
pet and zoonotic diseases understanding
 
05:02:28.250 --> 05:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
best techniques and they
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
they believe in the industry's
 
05:02:33.128 --> 05:02:33.138 align:start position:0%
self-regulation effort through education
 
05:02:36.170 --> 05:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
so I guess they're looking to
 
05:02:39.650 --> 05:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
at least the AKC is they didn't indicate
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
that they were for the bill or against
 
05:02:43.128 --> 05:02:43.138 align:start position:0%
the bill but just basically said how
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
they do things
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's great that's that's
 
05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
informative thank you any other
 
05:02:50.930 --> 05:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
05:02:54.890 --> 05:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill and and a great uh
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
stimulating question and answer thank
 
05:03:01.970 --> 05:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
you I also called Nancy Holmes to the
 
05:03:01.980 --> 05:03:03.470 align:start position:0%
you I also called Nancy Holmes to the
microphone

05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:21.170 --> 05:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy Holmes I'm here today
 
05:03:24.170 --> 05:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
from New Boston New Hampshire and I want
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
to support this bill for a study for um
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
groomer best practices what I'd love to
 
05:03:33.770 --> 05:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
see happen is that the state comes up
 
05:03:37.090 --> 05:03:37.100 align:start position:0%
with a best practices
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
type of list of things that groomers can
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
do to be considered somebody who's
 
05:03:46.730 --> 05:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
performing to best practices as an
 
05:03:49.490 --> 05:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
example I will not leave any of the
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
animals in my care unsupervised at any
 
05:03:52.320 --> 05:03:53.208 align:start position:0%
animals in my care unsupervised at any
time

05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the groomer has to be there
 
05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
it might be an assistant that's there
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
but somebody should be watching those
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
animals if that have been the case with
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
the golden retriever somebody should
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
have noticed that there was something
 
05:04:03.240 --> 05:04:04.970 align:start position:0%
have noticed that there was something
wrong

05:04:04.970 --> 05:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
um another one is that they would say
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
keep their premises clean at all times
 
05:04:12.410 --> 05:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
of animal waste and hair and debris from
 
05:04:12.420 --> 05:04:14.050 align:start position:0%
of animal waste and hair and debris from
grooming

05:04:14.050 --> 05:04:14.060 align:start position:0%
grooming
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
I know I'm pretty sure that businesses
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
like groomers have to meet local zoning
 
05:04:19.320 --> 05:04:21.110 align:start position:0%
like groomers have to meet local zoning
ordinances

05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
some of the questions I heard I I kind
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
of know the answers to which is that
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are different ways people become
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
groomers there are schools that purport
 
05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
to train you to become a groomer and run
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
your own business and they include
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
everything from running your business to
 
05:04:39.050 --> 05:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
how to groom an animal
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
there are people who learn how to groom
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
because they've got animals and they
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
groom them themselves
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
a more common method is apprenticeship
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
where you'll see that maybe like Petco
 
05:04:53.810 --> 05:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
and PetSmart and so on they'll be
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
groomers and then they'll be I don't
 
05:04:57.170 --> 05:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
know if they call them Junior groomers
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
or what they call them but these are
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
people who come in with no real
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge of grooming and they start out
 
05:05:04.490 --> 05:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
doing the small tasks like sweeping the
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
floor and you know maybe work out to
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
bathing an animal and then working up to
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
doing Trims and so on
 
05:05:12.350 --> 05:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
um there used to be a lady over
 
05:05:14.930 --> 05:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
Manchester who offered um an
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship ship course and I believe
 
05:05:20.090 --> 05:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
she had poodles but she would offer an
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship courts to teach people
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
how to become rumors and how to handle
 
05:05:28.570 --> 05:05:28.580 align:start position:0%
the dog safely and and so on
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
we also have groomers who come into this
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
state as part of the dog shows that take
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
place in the state their professional
 
05:05:39.770 --> 05:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
handlers who do their own grooming and
 
05:05:41.930 --> 05:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
they are being paid to do this work but
 
05:05:43.690 --> 05:05:43.700 align:start position:0%
they are not part of any local
 
05:05:43.700 --> 05:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
they are not part of any local
organization

05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
and if you've ever seen the poodles at a
 
05:05:50.330 --> 05:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
dog show boy know that you earn their
 
05:05:52.570 --> 05:05:52.580 align:start position:0%
money doing things
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
but I think you kind of have to think
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
about all the different kinds of
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
groomers you've got before you go laying
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
out you know what you must do I think
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
best practices would be a better choice
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
rather than rules and regulations of
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
what you must do
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you know saying that best practice is
 
05:06:12.410 --> 05:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
this and to be able to have a
 
05:06:14.208 --> 05:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
certificate on your wall that says I
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
abide by the New Hampshire State best
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
practices for animal groomers you know
 
05:06:21.770 --> 05:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
something like that so a person coming
 
05:06:25.010 --> 05:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
in can be confident that the rumor that
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with as opposed to some
 
05:06:28.368 --> 05:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
new groomer who just popped up the
 
05:06:30.170 --> 05:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
groomer that they're dealing with is
 
05:06:32.270 --> 05:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
um knows what they're doing understands
 
05:06:37.610 --> 05:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
what's the what uh the better ways are
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
of taking care of the animals in their
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
care another one that came up from my
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
mind is I uh you know as a best
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
practices that I will report to the
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
owner any health issues that I find
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
during the course course of grooming
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
so that if the animal has ear mites or a
 
05:06:57.288 --> 05:06:57.298 align:start position:0%
lump or you know a cut or something like
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be reported back to the
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
owner it isn't always I haven't used Too
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
Many groomers over time because I uh
 
05:07:07.730 --> 05:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
managed to figure out how to run a
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
Clipper myself and and the show dogs
 
05:07:13.368 --> 05:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
that I showed actually required a
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
different sort of grooming than you
 
05:07:17.930 --> 05:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
would get at a professional Groomer's um
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
business called hand stripping where you
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
pluck out the fur so many weeks before
 
05:07:23.890 --> 05:07:23.900 align:start position:0%
the show
 
05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
so it's much more complicated than what
 
05:07:28.850 --> 05:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
most groomers do but I think that that's
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
that not having
 
05:07:34.010 --> 05:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
a contact within the industry and maybe
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
somebody from dogs would be a good
 
05:07:38.208 --> 05:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
choice to contact and and discuss this
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
with but I think anybody here who has a
 
05:07:44.690 --> 05:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
hobby of any sort or who maybe belongs
 
05:07:46.010 --> 05:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
to a group I don't care if you're a
 
05:07:48.050 --> 05:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
gardener or whatever you would have a
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
hard time believing that somebody who
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
had never gardened in their life would
 
05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with best practices
 
05:07:55.970 --> 05:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
for you as a gardener I think it really
 
05:07:58.730 --> 05:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
does take some internal expertise I
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
believe I testified last time I didn't
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I did not look up my testimony
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
from before
 
05:08:07.788 --> 05:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
um that there was I think at least two
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state that are
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
groomer organizations
 
05:08:14.448 --> 05:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
um whether they survived covet or not I
 
05:08:16.010 --> 05:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I think you will will find this is a
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
growing industry because just as there
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
are more people who adopted animals
 
05:08:24.610 --> 05:08:24.620 align:start position:0%
during the coven
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
outbreak then so too all those animals
 
05:08:29.810 --> 05:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
or a portion of those animals will need
 
05:08:29.820 --> 05:08:30.890 align:start position:0%
or a portion of those animals will need
grooming

05:08:30.890 --> 05:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
grooming
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
so that the number of places to do such
 
05:08:36.830 --> 05:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
things were propping up I could open a
 
05:08:39.410 --> 05:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
shingle tomorrow say say I was an animal
 
05:08:39.420 --> 05:08:41.390 align:start position:0%
shingle tomorrow say say I was an animal
groomer

05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
groomer
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't count myself a
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
professional animal groomer at all
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
I know how to groom a couple kinds but
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh on the other hand that happens too
 
05:08:51.650 --> 05:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
that people who just feel they're good
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
with animals will do it I support a
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
study but I would like to see it
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
broadened a little bit so that you have
 
05:08:58.970 --> 05:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
experts I think somebody else mentioned
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
that too I like to like to see experts
 
05:09:03.170 --> 05:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
involved and I would love to see them
 
05:09:07.788 --> 05:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
come up with not necessarily a bill or a
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
law or a but a best practices standard
 
05:09:13.310 --> 05:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
that people can say they adhered to that
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
will help
 
05:09:17.208 --> 05:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
owners differentiate between one groomer
 
05:09:19.250 --> 05:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
and another and that wouldn't punish
 
05:09:21.890 --> 05:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
anybody who's self-taught or who went to
 
05:09:24.770 --> 05:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
school or who apprenticed to get where
 
05:09:26.448 --> 05:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
they were going as long as they're
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
abiding by the best practices to give
 
05:09:31.550 --> 05:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
the animals the best care and to get the
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
the owners back the best information
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
about their animals I think that would
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
be a good start and if down the road you
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
had to put in a law that would be the
 
05:09:43.550 --> 05:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
next step
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully my rambling is okay
 
05:09:49.810 --> 05:09:49.820 align:start position:0%
do you do you think that um
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
this best practices or or a set of
 
05:09:57.170 --> 05:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
Standards from the state would be
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
something that would be issued by the
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture yeah and it
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
could be you could go so far as that as
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
for them to have to pass an inspection
 
05:10:08.448 --> 05:10:08.458 align:start position:0%
for it though I can hear the state vets
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
screaming as I say that but you know
 
05:10:12.770 --> 05:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
they inspect pet stores
 
05:10:16.250 --> 05:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
they sorry they inspect pet stores to
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
make sure they're doing business
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
properly they inspect commercial
 
05:10:22.850 --> 05:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
groomers I'm not commercial breeders
 
05:10:26.690 --> 05:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
they inspect animal shelters
 
05:10:28.610 --> 05:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
um they respond to complaints about all
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
of those so I I would think maybe it
 
05:10:34.730 --> 05:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
could go into rules perhaps
 
05:10:37.010 --> 05:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
that these are the best practices for
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
people in animal grooming I I'm not as
 
05:10:42.410 --> 05:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
conversant with how the rules work
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know for sure I think it'd
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
be really nice if somebody had a list of
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
best practices so that I walking into a
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
groomer could see oh this person is not
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to leave my animal unattended at
 
05:10:56.448 --> 05:10:56.458 align:start position:0%
any time during the grooming process you
 
05:10:58.128 --> 05:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
know this person is has got a clean
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
place and they agree to keep the place
 
05:11:02.208 --> 05:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
clear and there's more those are just a
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
couple I thought of offhand
 
05:11:04.560 --> 05:11:06.890 align:start position:0%
couple I thought of offhand
representative

05:11:06.890 --> 05:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Nancy
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the AKC has a list of best practices
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
they already have something
 
05:11:21.128 --> 05:11:21.138 align:start position:0%
in what they do listing best practices
 
05:11:23.690 --> 05:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
why would we need to go through
 
05:11:25.850 --> 05:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
something if it's already out there why
 
05:11:28.850 --> 05:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
are we Reinventing the wheel
 
05:11:30.890 --> 05:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
say maybe we could borrow some of that
 
05:11:30.900 --> 05:11:31.970 align:start position:0%
say maybe we could borrow some of that
wheel

05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
wheel
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
because not AKC is a great organization
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's interested in dogs but if you ask
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
them how to
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
um groom a chiweenie
 
05:11:44.890 --> 05:11:44.900 align:start position:0%
or a maltipoo
 
05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
or a doodle you know they'd be a little
 
05:11:51.410 --> 05:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
lost at that the best practices might
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
cover that but I would like to see that
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um has something that that
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
gives groomers guidance as to where to
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
go with their business
 
05:12:09.170 --> 05:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
I I would think that the organizations
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
have those uh resp I don't know how many
 
05:12:15.170 --> 05:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
people belong to them and I don't know
 
05:12:17.090 --> 05:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
what they have for paperwork or whether
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're just a a group I have no I have
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
no idea I just know that there were a
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
couple in existence doesn't mean anybody
 
05:12:26.690 --> 05:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
had to join them representative
 
05:12:26.700 --> 05:12:30.970 align:start position:0%
had to join them representative
suffolkitis

05:12:30.970 --> 05:12:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a person that owns uh purebred dogs I
 
05:12:36.530 --> 05:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
will say
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of offering knowledge
 
05:12:42.170 --> 05:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
that the AKC is pretty much only
 
05:12:45.410 --> 05:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
concerned with purebred dogs
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
and so all of these hybrid breeds that
 
05:12:51.890 --> 05:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
are coming out and the rescue dogs and
 
05:12:55.090 --> 05:12:55.100 align:start position:0%
the mutts and you know those lovable
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
neighborhood dogs
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
are completely excluded from the AKC so
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's just professional breeders that are
 
05:13:08.770 --> 05:13:08.780 align:start position:0%
generally part of the AKC
 
05:13:11.330 --> 05:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question okay let's thinking
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
back to
 
05:13:19.850 --> 05:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
um the last time we heard a bill like
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
this and what we're trying to do uh it
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the organism that
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
rumors are looking for some Direction
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
they want some Direction but they
 
05:13:33.890 --> 05:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
probably do not have the time and energy
 
05:13:36.770 --> 05:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
and probably the expertise to create
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
their own professional organizations so
 
05:13:43.010 --> 05:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
it seems to me what would all of us
 
05:13:46.128 --> 05:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
think I guess about having something up
 
05:13:48.410 --> 05:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
something like this under the Department
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
not with a licensure but with a let's
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
say a certificate of best practices that
 
05:14:01.730 --> 05:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
you could put on your window that comes
 
05:14:04.190 --> 05:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Agriculture
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
for that a groomer would pay let's say
 
05:14:11.410 --> 05:14:11.420 align:start position:0%
25 a year nothing you know unreasonable
 
05:14:15.170 --> 05:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
and then if there was you know some kind
 
05:14:17.690 --> 05:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
of an issue that we would then have a
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
state agency where a consumer could then
 
05:14:24.410 --> 05:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
go to that state agency and say I have a
 
05:14:27.650 --> 05:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
concern with this groomer who is part of
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
your best practices what would you think
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
about something like that thank you you
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
just you voiced much better than I did
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know what my what my concept was is
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
that there would be a best practices and
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
a certificate to go with it and maybe an
 
05:14:44.208 --> 05:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
initial inspection and then only an
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
inspection if there is a complaint which
 
05:14:48.050 --> 05:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
is how they do most of their other
 
05:14:49.850 --> 05:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
inspection deals
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
um like I can remember making a
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
complaint about a pet store because I
 
05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
was there over holiday weekend and there
 
05:14:57.050 --> 05:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
was no food and water for the animals
 
05:14:58.970 --> 05:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
the puppies and kittens in the windows
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
were there with flipped over watered and
 
05:15:02.810 --> 05:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
food dishes all weekend I made a
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
complaint they checked it out that store
 
05:15:06.530 --> 05:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
got shut down actually but yes I would
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
think something like that and it would
 
05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
give a consumer
 
05:15:10.560 --> 05:15:12.530 align:start position:0%
give a consumer
um

05:15:12.530 --> 05:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:13.970 --> 05:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know if the
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
groomers want Direction I think maybe
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
they could use direction there's people
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
out there who are doing everything
 
05:15:20.690 --> 05:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
perfectly we know this I mean this
 
05:15:22.610 --> 05:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
groomers are just great
 
05:15:24.410 --> 05:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and then there's people who maybe
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
didn't even think about the fact that
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
they needed to do you know a supervision
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
over animals that were had been dried by
 
05:15:35.570 --> 05:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
by a podia dryer you know that people
 
05:15:36.890 --> 05:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
don't think about that until something
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
horrible happens
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
and I agreed with the person early
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
somebody early said something about
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
social media and I think in the last
 
05:15:46.128 --> 05:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
hearing and that's something that will
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
kill people if something goes wrong
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
right now if somebody's dog dies at a
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
groom or a boy that that social media or
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
uproar would would be deadly for that
 
05:15:58.250 --> 05:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
business I think having uh best
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
practices to fall back on saying well I
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
did this and I did this and I did this
 
05:16:04.128 --> 05:16:04.138 align:start position:0%
because this is the way the rules are
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
and you know if I miss something you
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't deliberate I was you know
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:16:18.890 --> 05:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and
 
05:16:20.750 --> 05:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for listening to me I
 
05:16:22.730 --> 05:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
don't see any other pink cards and
 
05:16:25.250 --> 05:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else in the room so
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.610 --> 05:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have one in one
 
05:16:34.730 --> 05:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
Channel online we're one opposed and one
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
in support but there's no attached
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
testimony or anything so
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
and then on the blue sheet
 
05:16:44.810 --> 05:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
we've got nothing
 
05:16:47.448 --> 05:16:47.458 align:start position:0%
so with that I will close the hearing on
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:04.368 --> 05:17:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:06.410 --> 05:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
and so we won't be meeting on that
 
05:17:06.420 --> 05:17:08.270 align:start position:0%
and so we won't be meeting on that
Tuesday

05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
05:17:12.410 --> 05:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
but we will be meeting on the 21st
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
and we will have a bunch of hearings on
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
the epr bill which is HB 253
 
05:17:22.010 --> 05:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
and then we have two landfill citing
 
05:17:22.020 --> 05:17:24.708 align:start position:0%
and then we have two landfill citing
bills

05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:24.718 --> 05:17:27.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:17:27.550 --> 05:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
my plan is to have an exec session on
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
the 28th
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I've only heard from one person who
 
05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
said that they wouldn't not be able to
 
05:17:41.570 --> 05:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
attend that
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
so I think we would probably go ahead
 
05:17:44.280 --> 05:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
so I think we would probably go ahead
with

05:17:45.590 --> 05:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah with that exact session on the 28th
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'll have to work out details of the
 
05:17:54.288 --> 05:17:54.298 align:start position:0%
time because we may want to have
 
05:17:56.330 --> 05:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
we may want to have some
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
time in the morning for our caucus or
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
for the committee to get together and
 
05:18:02.218 --> 05:18:03.410 align:start position:0%
for the committee to get together and
perhaps

05:18:03.410 --> 05:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
05:18:03.420 --> 05:18:04.910 align:start position:0%
perhaps
um

05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:07.490 --> 05:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
have a work session on one or two bills
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know I need to talk to
 
05:18:21.730 --> 05:18:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.770 --> 05:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
he might require okay yeah so okay
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
um I mean they're not they're not early
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
bills they're all we all have till March
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:57.050 --> 05:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
right right
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
Brouillard Haskins
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
and you as well I don't did you
 
05:19:10.980 --> 05:19:13.010 align:start position:0%
and you as well I don't did you
okay

05:19:13.010 --> 05:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:13.020 --> 05:19:14.448 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

05:19:14.448 --> 05:19:14.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
who can't make the first um
 
05:19:27.530 --> 05:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Davis can't make the
 
05:19:29.330 --> 05:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
first Tuesday of March
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is in March we're going
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
to start having a lot more sessions yeah
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.600 --> 05:19:41.530 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:19:41.530 --> 05:19:41.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
you have to come in here two or three
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
days in a row is is really a hardship
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay yeah so I I guess
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:56.810 --> 05:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.650 --> 05:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.660 --> 05:20:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:20:12.410 --> 05:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:12.420 --> 05:20:15.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:20:15.610 --> 05:20:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.650 --> 05:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the 21st we are looking at I haven't
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
set the schedule yet but we are looking
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
at hearing the epr bill which is HB 253
 
05:20:34.128 --> 05:20:34.138 align:start position:0%
uh and then the two landfill citing
 
05:20:39.530 --> 05:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
bills in the afternoon HB 56 and hb602
 
05:20:41.448 --> 05:20:41.458 align:start position:0%
um yeah we would probably I in the
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon of the 21st I'd want to have
 
05:20:46.250 --> 05:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh Republican caucus so we
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%

heard

05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%

05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
05:20:57.770 --> 05:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
