00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
little unal this morning just because
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of people in the room
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
if you guys would make my life easier
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
and just sit at one of the seats over
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
here with a mic in front of you we can
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
just have a conversation just you know
 
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
can so we keep order but otherwise that
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
way we don't have to bounce around all
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
all right so we're starting the morning
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
looking at at uh SB
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
437 and uh Mr chairman you wanted to
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
share a few things to start so if you
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
want to get the conversation rolling we
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
can go from there thank you Mr chair so
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
just to sort of give us the lay of the
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
land this this bill really deals with
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
two issues one is the fact that
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities were supposed to be
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
sending their amendments to the bcrb for
 
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes for a long
 
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
time now four and I think maybe now five
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
have done that out of the 100 plus that
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
enforce the building code clearly that
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
was not working um all this bill does is
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
hold their feet to the fire and say
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
everybody send them to us if it was a
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
legal ordinance when you passed it
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
you're good to go we just check the
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
boxes and no problem no must no fuss
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's simply a clock in there to get
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
them to send it to us um the other thing
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
this deals with is if I can real quick
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
and if they don't do that within 60 days
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
they can't enforce it right right and
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
what happens next is up for grabs I
 
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
guess but well so in other words
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's building something it doesn't
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
live up to the code that they were right
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um trying to enforce and then the
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
builders offs Scot free as far as they
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
can't be fined they can't be anything
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
like that because they haven't put this
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
through the building code guess that's
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
the outcome of it okay that's how I read
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
it but I just want to so part one of
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is to deal with getting the
 
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities to send those amendments
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
to the bcrb we check the boxes and
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're good to go provided they were
 
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.749 align:start position:0%
they're good to go provided they were
legal

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances um we just had an appeal that
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
turned out that they never had an
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
ordinance to create a building code
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
board of appeals so there's a lot of
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things out there I
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
suspect and this will flush some of that
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
to the surface uh the second thing that
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
this deals with is uh at least two
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities Portsmouth and Durham
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
have adopted later additions of the
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
model codes which are in the State
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
Building Code um and in fact Steve
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
reports that now both of them have
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
ordinances that basically say we just
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
adopt the new code we haven't read it
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
yet and it hasn't even published yet but
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
the day it's published it's in effect in
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
our town um it my understanding is from
 
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
2002 when the State Building Code was
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
created that was never the intent the
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
wording in the r RSA that allows towns
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
to adopt codes that are not otherwise in
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
the state code was put there to allow
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
them to adopt things like Property
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and housing codes so things
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
that the state code doesn't even deal
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
with not later additions of the codes
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
that are in the in the state code uh it
 
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
really comes down to do you want a
 
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code or do you not
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
because once a town or municipality can
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
do that all bets are off uh anybody can
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
adopt anything they want basically so
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
this tries uh to nail that down and it
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
was very difficult language to get our
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
arms around uh to prohibit them from
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
adopting later additions but still
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
preserving the right to adopt a property
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance or housing code and others
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
here have been involved in the process
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh longer than I have and may have a
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
have a different flavor on this but this
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
really comes down to those two issues
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
getting the municipal amendments
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
submitted and prohibiting the model
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
codes from you know being updated within
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality so this would be why we
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
changed the language uh let's say in
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
line four and line five from provisions
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
and regulations to amendments you're TR
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to use that language to
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
attach it to a specific code that the
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
state board has passed there we need to
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
remember that much of the language
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's kicking around particularly in
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
the 674
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
series was kicking around before there
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
was a State Building Code MH so and 47
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 47 colon 22 is is a prime example
 
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
that language goes back what maybe the
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
1700s a long time anyway and it just was
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
before the before the days of modern
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
codes and you know well you can adopt
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
very broad language rather than you can
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
adopt a code uh so there was some sort
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
of housekeeping on the terminology as as
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
we went through this you're correct cor
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.230 align:start position:0%
we went through this you're correct cor
okay

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you may have answered this uh line
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
six the language that says and this
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
comes up throughout the bill intended to
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
replace is that on page one uh page one
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
line six yes than so it gives three
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
caveats right every time it's it can't
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
be not inconsistent with or less
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
stringent than nor intended to replace
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
and the nor intended to replace is meant
 
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.069 align:start position:0%
and the nor intended to replace is meant
to

00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
capture so there's two ways to adopt the
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
later addition of a code just say we
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
adopt the later addition or submit you
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
know 400 amendments that just change
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
every section that changed in the new
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
code so that was the thing that was very
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to get our arms around and we
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
put that in there it's obviously a
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
subjective term um although maybe not if
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
it ever went to Discovery uh but that's
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's what that's trying to trying to
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
do okay
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
yeah there was language further down I'm
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe talk to that
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
too okay so you're so you're putting
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
that you're putting that language in and
 
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
then basically trying to backtrack that
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
which seemed like the more contentious
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
part of the bill or not not even
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
contentious but the one that raised some
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
concern um on the model codes no on
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
going back and andfor foring that on
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay at a time when it was legal for
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
them to do it but you had mentioned
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
something earlier that caught my
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
attention um so I was going to ask the
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
question Durham and and Dober I believe
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
correct Durham and Portsmouth Portsmouth
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
so they passed they passed code during
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
that that open window before it was
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
effective was part of that what you just
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned which is that they
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
automatically update to the current code
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
they did that during that time I I know
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
that was the case with Durham and Steve
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
says that's not a case with Portsmouth
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
as well Portsmith did yeah when they
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
updated they specifically updated a lot
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
of the codes but the electrical code
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
they said were adopting the newest code
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
going forward they don't even know what
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
it says and they and they did that in in
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
that open window yeah so that's what
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying okay that's much more
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
serious I was going to say if they were
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
because we had testimony during the
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
hearing that um with the issuance of new
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
adopted code like we just adopted new
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
code that those codes would become obs
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
Delite and they head after for renew but
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
not if they've not if they've adopted
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
we're just accepting new code if if we
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't have as as it comes out page two
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
it talks about the that uh reset so to
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
speak on July 1 yeah so yes that's what
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
happens any of those codes that adopted
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
in that Gap technically would be able to
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
stay because there was something in that
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
said any existing on so this is a reset
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
for the Fire Marshall and his staff be
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
able to log everybody in every town and
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
City and everybody start over so if you
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't have that it it creates an issue
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
for those two that went in or one that
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
went in in that six- Monon Gap trying to
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
to beat that and adopting it going
 
00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.829 align:start position:0%
to beat that and adopting it going
forward

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
so that was what Senator Carson was
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about was you know they had
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
the six month when the codes are adopted
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
they get adopted in July and they give a
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
six-month period to follow either code
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
the old or the new and during that
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
period is when they um they just said
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're just going to adopt the new code
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
immediately when it comes out they went
 
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
through the process they adopted a lot
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
of building codes and updated them and
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
then in there they adopted it on the
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
electrical side saying they're going to
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
adopt the 2026 code already hasn't even
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
been printed so yeah so that was part of
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
the concern part of the concern we
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
raised with Senator Carson was you know
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
that was just trying to get around it
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the intent so this just kind
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
of makes everybody start over from
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
square one and again it's just trying to
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
make them follow the existing law that
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
is required now and has been for years
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
to to adopt amendments not that Smith or
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
Dober didn't follow that but you know
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh so so was was consideration I'm
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to understand this much
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
better now um and it's a little bit more
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
serious than I thought it was
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
initially have did was consideration
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
given when drawing up the language as
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to doing the whole adopted to
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
Prior uh to July 1st 2024 whatever um
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
just saying that municipalities local
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
governing authorities can't wholesale
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
adopt code like can't they just can't
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
adopt code to that level because that
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
would address the major concern without
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
it appearing like you're going back and
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
doing something retroactively if you
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
look at line 10 on page one you see us
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
referencing the same or similar scope
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that was an attempt to
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
say one you know from addition to
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
addition the scope is either the same or
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty darn similar but also there
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
are alternative building codes there are
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
alternative plumbing and mechanical
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
codes that are published some are used
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the Western United States main and
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts use an alternative goes
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
way back but it uses an alternative
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
plumbing code um so similar scope no you
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
can't go grab another plumbing code just
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
because you like that one better than
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
the one the state has um it's imperfect
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
language we grappled with it a lot and
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody's got a way to tie it down
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
tighter that would be
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
good but also one of the things we did
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
with if I may the wording in there the
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
similar scope most codes have a scope in
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
the front of their code telling what it
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
is so we're not making up the scope it's
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
printed in that book so someone comes
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
with another one and it's the exact same
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
scope well then it's pretty obvious that
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
they're trying to adopt an entirely
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
different code from that right because
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
whereas if it doesn't have the same or
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
similar scope then it it makes sense for
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to look at so is
 
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
that is that the technical term
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
scope but in some section one of most of
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
the codes it's titled scope or purpose
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we put that that that would
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
make sense okay we to find that to make
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
sure that that was something that was
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
referenced in each one for the most part
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
to try to so it's not the State Building
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
Code ass siging if your scope similar
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's right there in the front of
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
the cover you open up the page two and
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's usually says it or something so
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no that's I mean I I would
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
agree that I think that is as long as
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's what that's the terminology
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's used that it would make sense to
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
use that language
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
here but that would be that would be a a
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
different scope then there's what you do
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
use for review right and you adopt the
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
building code or the fire code you are
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
using a set of um we have eight codes
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
within the building code right so does
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
that does that does that keep them
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
though from adopting a future code from
 
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
the same organization that you're using
 
00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.389 align:start position:0%
the same organization that you're using
that

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
language same organization or any other
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
organization and that's the intent
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
whether we've got it right or not time
 
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
whether we've got it right or not time
will

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
tell well only to only to say that there
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
there will be um people staying up
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
nights trying to find ways around this
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
no I agree and I well that's what has me
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
concerned on that on the bottom of page
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
two and the top of Page Three
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
is is whether or not the language that's
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
being used uh I'm sorry what was your
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
name again sir bill yeah yeah um that
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
the concern that you brought up I I
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
share that concern with the with the
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
language as it's written here and I
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to give it maybe a little bit
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
of thought to see if we could come up
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
with something a little bit different um
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
because it seems like as it's written
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
you're doing retroactive law which is
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
against the Constitution which I think
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
could open you up to lawsuit I agree
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
with that I have some concern I had some
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
concern when I initially read it and if
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
I did somebody else is going to think
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
about it and and potentially go after it
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
when really what I think is trying to be
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
accomplished and correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that you just don't want people
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
adopting wholesale code two years ahead
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
of what you've adopted so if you there
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
two two parts to that though one is what
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
you just said yeah but the other is
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
there are amendments that are not
 
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
amendments floating around out there
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
this is what I I like in my town just go
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
do it a town that's using the zba as a
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
board of appeals but never had an
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance to do that which is what we
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
just found on an appeal that came to us
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh so if somebody has a legally adopted
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
ordinance and that if there's a
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
technical requirement it's at least as
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
stringent not less string not less
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
stringent we use funny words there than
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
the state code which has been in the law
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
now since there's been a state code
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
check the box and off they go no problem
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
at all take us 30 seconds to review it
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Timmy I think the the backwards
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
part of it in my head is just trying to
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
we've been asked for the last few years
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
to compile a list of these are the state
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
codes building or fire these are the
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
state amendments building or fire and
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
then all by the way here's who where you
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
can find the local amendments and as
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
I've described it's like a hide-and-seek
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
game right now to try to figure out what
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
conquer has what Manchester has what
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
Berlin has and you know we've only got
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
four or five right now um I don't know
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
how we without being retroactive right
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge how do we get the
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
communities to
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
submit the local amendments and then
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity just to vet them
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure they were properly adopted
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
at the local level and they're not in
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
conflict with the code I think that's so
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's this part two of that I think may
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
be a little bit challenging I mean and
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
in our from Department safety
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
perspective I think it's up to you guys
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
on how you want to
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
do can the portsmiths and uh durhams
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
just wholesale adopt the the later the
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
21 or now maybe coming up on the 24
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
codes when we're still a cycle behind
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
which which for years now we're saying
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
we want to stay a code cycle behind and
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
then there's a couple communities that
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
going further out so like I think
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
the the general feeling I think from
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
industry is to stop that behavior right
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't don't jump ahead we we we've all
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
agreed the code processor should be one
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
cycle behind so we can vet it properly
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then the flip to that is that I've
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
been hearing is there's an ask to be a
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop so I can understand if I'm
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
building in New Hampshire whether I'm a
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner trying to build a deck or do
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
some electrical work at my house or I'm
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
building the new parking garage and
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's an architect that's out of state
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
then come and find these are all the
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is where I need to go for New
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I just worked with a uh
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
architect out of
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
Ohio uh very good architect that solid
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
on the building code but missed that we
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
had the fire code um and uh we we
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
stumble into that a lot so if we can
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
create that One-Stop shop where
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
everything is for the design
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
professionals and everything else I
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
think that's would make it a lot easier
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
for the end user that's yeah no no and I
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate both of the comments that you
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
made and and I think I mean I can't
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
speak for my colleagues but I mean it
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense to me
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
um when we instituted the building code
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code obviously we're
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
overriding local code at that point so
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
the state has precedent that it can
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
override local code we can do that um
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
but now there is state code in place and
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
so now we've got this
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
interesting interaction between state
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
code and local code that wasn't the
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
dynamic when we put the code the state
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
code in place the first time so that's a
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
new Dynamic to it
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering if there's
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
language that we can
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
use that would simply
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
State um the expectation that any local
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
code regardless of When It Was Written
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
now needs to be brought before the
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board for approval
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
regardless as opposed to
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
specifying a certain group of people at
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
a certain time in this little
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
window I just think that that opens you
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
up in a way that maybe isn't necessary
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
we may be able to find a different way
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
to write it and get the same result and
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
to my two colleagues that are here if
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
you have other thoughts or different
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
perspective on this Chim INE at any time
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I'll recognize you for that but um
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I just so when you talking about
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
the retroactive chair are you talking
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
about the July 1 issue or the is that on
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
line page two line 27 27 through Page
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that whole section there
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
so and and I I completely understand
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're saying is trying
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's no matter what
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
and we thought that that was kind of
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that so that everybody has
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
to resubmit it if you if you submitted
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
it prior to July 1 and we picked that
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
because we thought legislation would be
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
done possibly the bill would be signed
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
that that would be the the say okay here
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
we go here's a reset button so the Fire
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
Marshall can get everybody on board and
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
do that it wasn't we weren't trying to
 
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.230 align:start position:0%
do that it wasn't we weren't trying to
be

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
um leaning to one side or the other you
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
know prejudice against one side or the
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
other it in a lot of the towns who have
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
some stuff in there I don't know how
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
many I'm not going to they've don't I
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
don't know something all realize the
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
process they need to go through to
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
legally adopt an amendment so for years
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
they've been doing this right and then
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden in in the previous
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
wording it stated that anything prior to
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
that stays in place so that defeats the
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
whole bill if we leave that now if
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
there's different wording absolutely
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
agree but that was what that was
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
intended to do is kind of give us a
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
reset so I'm not sure if it does but
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no I understand and another
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
item that we've discovered
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
is these towns that had had maybe
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
adopted their local ordinances back
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
under the 674
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
regulations they don't go back and
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
review whether those amendments are in
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with state code at this point
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
now they continue to enforce or
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
administer those amendments but I've
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
often and even with my community gone
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
back to look at the Amendments that
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
we've had prior and discovered that that
 
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
whole section of code has moved so now
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing the wrong section in
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
code so every three years any community
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
that has amendments should be going
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
through to review all of their
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
amendments that they propose and
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
resubmit them to the build and code
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
review board it just makes the most
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
sense and that way there you aren't in
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
code have you got have you got
 
00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:30.230 align:start position:0%
code have you got have you got
thanks

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
P have you got the
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
capacity with your Manpower and your
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
working hours and so forth to do all
 
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.590 align:start position:0%
working hours and so forth to do all
that

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide review of individual
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
communities I I think so and and the
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
fire marshal is going to throw something
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
at me if I speak here uh I don't think
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
that the time involv D with these is
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
excessive okay um we've been through
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
several of them uh amher for instance
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
added a technical Amendment on water
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
quality very straightforward you could
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
review that in a couple of minutes Kanan
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
we worked with in detail because they
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
had this mishmash between zoning and
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
building stuff from back in the day that
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
took a little more time but many of
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
these will just be go sorted out and
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
come back to us uh so I I don't think
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of time and furthermore this
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
process is going to get rid of a lot of
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
that stuff they're going to look at it
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
and say it's out of date don't even
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
submit it we don't need it
 
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.190 align:start position:0%
submit it we don't need it
anymore

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
I if I could add one other point yeah
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
please this is back on the later edition
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
of the model codes uh Med kinsky who's
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
the municipal association's
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative on our board reports that
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
he's had calls from six municipalities
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
looking to do what Durham and Portsmouth
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
have done and it's all part of this
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
energy code tussle so I think this is
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
the time we've somehow got to get our
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
arm around this or just cash in a state
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
building code and go back to the
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
do if I may Mr chair every town before
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
was using different Boer codes and
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
different building codes so it was crazy
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
to to figure out who was following what
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
and and you know like he said you get
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
into some towns I testified early at the
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee with the inspector even though
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
I proved that I was following the code
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
and was right he still said well this is
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
what I
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
want how are we supposed to run a
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
business and do the work when you know
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
you you get that interjected someplace
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
so this make sure it goes through the
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
proper process it's a it's a um what do
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
you call board um neutral board that is
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
made up of experts as opposed to to one
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
person in the town going this is what I
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
think is best keep in mind our building
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
inspectors for the most part some are uh
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
qualified in um going
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
through requirements but nothing in the
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
state requires them to have any
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications some of them don't know
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
anything about electrical or Plumbing
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
mechanical and they're telling us what
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
to do and we have to go there and show
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
them the Code prove to them and then
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
they still say well this is what I want
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
so it's trying to fix that a little bit
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
too but it gives you an appeal process
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
at that point you can go to the building
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
code review board and say it hasn't been
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
submitted properly so you can't enforce
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
it exactly right now we'd have to take a
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
legal process which is expensive so you
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
just do it whereas now we could go to
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
the board if I go and I get a permit now
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
right if this was in place and I go and
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
I get a permit and they say hey here's a
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
list like in pelam they have a list that
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
you get with your permit of what he
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
wants okay I go I pull up the website on
 
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
the State Building because it's been
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
logged I see they have it on there and
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
all those are there or not if not I at
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
least have some legal ground to say Hey
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
look it's not posted have you fought
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
follow proper procedure it gives us some
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
some help to deal with that that's right
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
it might not help it might not help the
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
one guy who's doing some work in his
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
home and they come in and say something
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
because he doesn't know the code but
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to help larger construction
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
all these projects all the working
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing I mean this there's a
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
lot there's a lot of that have the
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
little little quirks and it's tough
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
it'll help everybody who who knows this
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
stuff essentially trying to be
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
consistent that's all well all I'm
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
saying is that a local enforce
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement agent would be able to go in
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe pressure somebody to adopt
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
code that wasn't required because they
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know the individual who's doing
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
the work might not know that it had to
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
go through the state you know building
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
code review board so they're not going
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to appeal it and in that case
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to get away with
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing code that's too stringent or
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
you know whatever and also if they
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the process say they're
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
just saying I want this they're they're
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
enforcing something illegally
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
technically because it didn't pass
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that's been in the laws
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
for forever we found out about that they
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
have to go through a town process
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
whatever that municipality is to get it
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
approved they can't just say here's a
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
sheet here's what I want so this helps
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
here's here's an aspect of this that I
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
um we've probably got about 20 more
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
minutes on on this one um we'll have to
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
have another morning anyway but say
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's uh a homeowner
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
um who is doing a renovation project at
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
their house or you know whatever the
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
case may be with a small contractor who
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't really understand the
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
interaction between the local code
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
Authority and the building code review
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
board at the state we pass
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
this say the local um code
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
enforcer requires that the Builder um
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
use code
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's that hasn't gone to the building
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
code review board for acceptance right
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not technically legal the owner
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
has to spend an extra $110,000 on the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
project to meet that code that wasn't
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
legal and then on the back side they
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
find out that it wasn't a legal code
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
because it hadn't gone to the building
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
code review board is is there now civil
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
action available to that person to
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
recoup from the town or whoever the code
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
agency was working for to to recoup that
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
$10,000 from the town because they were
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
illegally enforcing a code because they
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
not I'm not a lawyer um so that would
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
answer somewhere beyond the code process
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the code process uh but you
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
you may be right I might note that
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
Connecticut mucked around with this
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
several years ago and actually made the
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
building inspector person Ally liable if
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
they required anything that wasn't in
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
the code they got rid of that in a hurry
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
because it just caused I think so much
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
harassment um but there's always an
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
ability at the court level to come after
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that caused you harm yeah I
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like it it seems like it
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
would because we're saying it's illegal
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
and they're doing something illegal just
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
just curious building inspectors are
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
indemnified from from lawsuits and and
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
legal action except in cases of gross
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
negligence so in this case here if an
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
attorney if it's civil suit is filed and
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
they can argue that by you know
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
knowingly enforcing a code that's not
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state and we have this
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
Statute in place with the language that
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
says you can't do that then I think you
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
could make the argument that that was
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
gross negligence and then the the
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
inspector himself would be Li maybe not
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
the town
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and just to add on to that
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
let's say they did it before this passed
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
they still that homeowner still has that
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
right and could go after that legally
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be a longer process
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
because it didn't go through and show
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they didn't follow they may not
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
know what they really have to do as
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
municipality to be legally adopted so
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
even now they if they didn't follow that
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
process that homeowner still would have
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
that but the Avenue is obviously more
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
expensive and you get caught in the
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
middle of I want my CEO or I'm going to
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
fight this for a year and not be able to
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
move into my house and that's right what
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
happen so yeah that makes sense okay um
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
real quickly anything from the committee
 
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.310 align:start position:0%
real quickly anything from the committee
members

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
members
okay

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
um oh uh just a couple notes that I made
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
um there's no need to reference RSA 153
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
in this at all there's nothing that
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
would hit 153 that doesn't hit 155
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to go before the building
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
code review board we we've got the line
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom that says that
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
everything's going to have to go by the
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal for verification that
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict with the fire code
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing that would arise
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
independent of that is there yes Mr
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
chairman we tried to cover the fire code
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
as it applies to RSA 47 for
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
cities the 674 series only applies to
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
the building code anyway um so 153 sort
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
of sat the way it is okay so 47
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
addresses 153 I didn't I didn't see it
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
specific I don't know it well enough is
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding and Sean and I have
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
talked about this is that cities have
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to to amend the fire code
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
through RSA 47 towns do not currently
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
have the Legal Trail to be able to amend
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
code right so that's that's you're
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the last line there Phil
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
when you're saying uh 32 of of the
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
entire Bill 32 of Page Three you're
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
saying that reference there to 4722 you
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
enough to cover to cover everything
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
having to do with the fire code
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
tried to do that others a to review it
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we got it right but yeah we
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
take another look but I think we
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
captured it but to Phil's Point there's
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
a little I've asked the AG's office to
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
look in the path for town to adopt
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
changes and I'm still waiting to hear
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
back on them right now but okay that
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
one's a little vague
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to find we found
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
another spot in 155a it talks about
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
State Building and the fire code mhm um
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
quick in 155a which is a State Building
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Code it also in the definitions talks
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
about the state fire code and points it
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
back to 1531 so
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
in we believe it captures it both there
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
rather than having a point in two
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
different directions sure
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
but okay well a little I'll take a yeah
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'll take another look at it too and if
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
I think there's concern I'll run stuff
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
by you guys before the next subcommittee
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
when we move it out of here perfect um
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
but I just I noticed that and just
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we didn't need
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
to reference 153 at all and then uh
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
there is the question and we can talk
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
about it with the few minutes we've got
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
left on this bill um
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
page one yes page one lines 24 to
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
29 there's a conflict with HB 1387 in
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
the language because 1387 actually
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
repeals this section
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
um and my question to everybody is if we
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
get rid of that language in this bill is
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
that going to cause any problems to the
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
overall concept or
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
not because if we allow it to be
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
repealed and then we just take that
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
language line 24 through 29 out of this
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
bill completely so that it no longer
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
exists is that going to weaken this
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
language and make it unworkable sure
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
just for the record 1387 proposes to
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
repeal this section right which would
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
leave this here all this is is a flag to
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
other rsas it's not critical that it be
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
there or not be there uh we just wanted
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure this bill didn't get mucked
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
up if 1387 got passed first right okay
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
so if there's I would prefer and I can
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
talk to Howard Pearl about it and make
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we do it in a timely way that
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
makes sense but I would prefer to leave
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
the repeal in and then just take 24 to
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
29 out of this bill through an amendment
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
and then it's not going to mess with the
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to not pass this bill
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
because that's taken out
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
it yeah um we we had reached out to
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
actually have him do it the opposite
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
take the repeal out of 1387 and leave
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
this alone is what we were we felt was a
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
better fix I don't know if you're okay
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
with that or not well the only reason
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
why I say do the other way is it takes a
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff out of Statute if it
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be in there if it's not
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishing anything um I'd rather
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
take the duplicative language out with
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
through the repeal and then not have to
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
have this being referenced it would just
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
take two sections out of Statute that
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
arguably don't need to be there and so
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
my question is I would rather take two
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
pieces out that don't need to be there
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
if they don't need to be there rather
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
than leave them in and have them be
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
unimportant so my question is whether or
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
not this is important to the bill
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
because I'm not seeing how it is
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
important to the bill but if you do see
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
how it is then
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
I'm because of referencing this is the
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
reference to 67451 and
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
4722 I believe those go through and
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
explain the procedures that counties
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
towns and cities must go through in in
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
order to adopt an amendment to the State
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
Building Code so yeah so I think I think
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of important to direct them to
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that they know that if if
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
you're amending the State Building Code
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
in any way towns have to follow the
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
67451 and cities have to follow the
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
process in
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
4722 but yeah my my point is doesn't
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
67451 and 4722 already articulate that
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
on their own like if you go to
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
674 and read that doesn't it already
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
articulate articulate and in fact you
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
can look up at the bill above it uh
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning the local
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body in 674 May enact as an
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance right which is essentially
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
what that's saying down below or adopt
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the procedures so it's
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
lining out that you need the ordinance
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
already in place in order to pass any
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code which is
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
what we would be doing in this bill um
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
so that delineates that are you
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
concerned mostly just about um delinting
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
counties towns cities and Village
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
districts specifically as opposed to
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
local legislative
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
bodies because I don't believe cities
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
are captured in are cities captured in
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
675 no it it would be captured in 4722
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
though correct so that's so that order
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is I think that RSA
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
stands on its own like it already says
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
to a city or town you have to go through
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know applicable uh ordinance in
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
order to adopt new code so if both of
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
those sections of RSA already say you
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
need an ordinance to adopt the code I'm
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
not sure why we would need this
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
reference to tell them to go look at
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
those places to adopt an ordinance to
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
adopt the
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
code but
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes my personal view of this is I think
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
it's a convenience but it's not critical
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
because as you said those two sections
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
stand on their own um we have some
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
people looking at whether we can pull
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff into
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
155a so it's all in one place that's an
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
exercise for another year it's fairly
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
complicated uh but I think this is just
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
a convenience right now and it's not
 
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.390 align:start position:0%
a convenience right now and it's not
necessary

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
okay yes uh I think 674 51a is specific
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
to so the municipal municipality May
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
adopt by reference any of the codes
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
prated by the ICC and shorten it which
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
are not included in the State Building
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
Code so I think that was the uh that
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
talks about like the property
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance code and those types of
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
things that's what 51a talks
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
about 51a we're proposing we just repeal
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
it because it's mostly duplicative of
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
other stuff so that we have I guess the
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
concern would be is if
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
we is it clear enough somewhere else
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
that someone could still do the property
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance code or something for using
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
that it's an
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
example yeah I think we tried to cover
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
that in page one line 8 n and so forth
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
so the local legislative body May adopt
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
a nationally recognized code not
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
included in not in inconsistent with so
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
forth yeah it makes sense
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that makes sense yeah so we're
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're feeling okay about that I don't
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
want to screw up the bill that's all I'm
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
saying we can do that right would you be
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
willing to give us afterwards we'll just
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that yeah yeah um like I said
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna we probably got a week before
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
I've got to finalize it but I will have
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
to get an amendment put together for
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
that meeting so I'd need a few days so
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
like if you guys want to get back to me
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
with any concerned by the end of the
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
week my only other concern is I've got
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
to do this in conjunction with Howard
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
poral over in the Senate because he's
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to be doing stuff over there so
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
I've got to ask him to hold off until at
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
least Friday or whatever but if you get
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
it to me after that then I can work with
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
him and we can get the language right
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
and and get it in time for an amendment
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
to if by chance they were executing that
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
today and they were trying to do that
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
would you be able to fix that still
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
because well if he does that I'll just
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
do it the other way so if if the repeal
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
goes like if they get rid of the repeal
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
we'll just we'll just leave it as it is
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so if I don't get to them in
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
time it's no big deal I'm just trying to
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
clean up statute if you if you're if
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
you're in the habit which I'm sure
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
everybody here is of weeding through
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute all the time the less is more
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a pet peeve of mine over
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
the last four years so
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
um perfect anything else from anybody
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
time only that this is a difficult set
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
of stuff it's hard to understand makes
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
your eyes roll back but it really
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
addresses two critical problems whether
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have a Statewide building code or not
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
and this whole issue of local amendments
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
and whether we can find them and that
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're legal so I would just hope that
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
that the entire committee and then on to
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
the other appropriate bodies uh gets
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
this thing through but thank you for for
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
looking at it absolutely and I
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
understand this way better so I
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate you guys coming in and and
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking me through it cuz um there are
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that I just wouldn't have picked
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
up on just reading it so that's that's
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
very helpful to me um you you mentioned
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
that though and it did bring up one more
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
question that I just wanted
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
clarification on um you had mentioned
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
you can do it two ways you can either
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
adopt a future set of the code right
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
later date um or you could just pass 400
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
little amendments in order to get
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
yourself there
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
how does this close that loophole what
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
what particular part of language are you
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking to close that loophole I
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand the code like the overall
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
just adopting whole code but the death
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
by death by 400 Cuts so our languag is
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
on page one line 12 the intent of this
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
restriction shall not be avoided by the
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
adoption of local amendments as
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
determined by the billing code okay so
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's the section that you're looking
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
to do that with all right I I know
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause us trouble but
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
maybe this balloon will float to the
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
surface quickly and we'll fix it once
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
and that'll SLE it so okay and so just
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
once again for my own
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
edification two things that you're
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish one old code that
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
isn't that doesn't meet the requirements
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
of this legislation because it's it's
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
less restrictive than our current code
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's been floating out you want to
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
flush that stuff out or a properly
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
adopted ordinance that's the bigger
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
issue okay and then obviously because
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the one side of the one
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
side of the issue and the other is
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
restricting what they can do to adopt
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
more restrictive code to one degree or
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
at least having to come through the
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
building code review board and not being
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
able to do it holistically like just as
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
the codes have gotten into energy and to
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
a degree accessibility and some of the
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
the things that drift a little bit away
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
from Pure safety what's more res what's
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
more stringent gets harder and harder to
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
to think
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
about because it might require more here
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
but less there that kind of thing so
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you gentlemen very much
 
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.309 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you gentlemen very much
appreciate

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
it we will let you know when the next
 
00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.309 align:start position:0%
it we will let you know when the next
one

00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
is at least 24 hours
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
notice and I was I was 25 hours on this
 
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.150 align:start position:0%
notice and I was I was 25 hours on this
one

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah no I'll try to post a days this
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:47:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:55.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
um this amendment basically just
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies that uh they're leaving um
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
written testimony open for seven days
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
and not spoken testimony because that
 
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:48.799 align:start position:0%
seems like a bad idea
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
um just does um so that's basically what
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
it does in the original bill it said
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
seven days and it kind of left it vague
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
in fact it almost seemed the opposite
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
seemed like you had to submit written
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
testimony immediately but you had 7 days
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
to give verbal testimony um so this just
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
reverses that and the original language
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
is at the bottom of page two and the top
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
of Page Three on the actual bill so
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative boy is looking at that
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
any concerns from the other committee
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
members who have had a chance to peruse
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
that language I don't if this
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
works seems like seems like a good idea
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think generally that do I
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
have to say my name for the record no
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think generally for the
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
record you wouldn't us to be sitting at
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we really put a cap on
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
written testimony I think people can
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
just submit things to the boards
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
whenever they want so I uh even with
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
this language in place we would probably
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
time I don't know I would possibly
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
disagree with that because any public
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
hearings for uh rules that go to jard it
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
says you know the written comment is
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
requested by a certain date they have a
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
deadline so I think this stays
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
consistent with it and again it wasn't
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
meant for them to have seven days to
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
have public comment spoken that was
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
never really the intent I think Doug
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
caught it it was it was a good catch and
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
it was meant to have seven days to send
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
it in so and uh so I was speaking just
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
kind of in general but for rules we
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
usually keep it open for 10 days anyway
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay just as a general practice so is
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
there a reason why we wouldn't switch
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
this to 10 days to be consistent would
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
it be best to stay consistent just keep
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
that it's an
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
easy that language was just there
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
so if that would keep it consistent with
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
everything else keep cons well I I don't
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
know cuz like is it oh that's an
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
interesting is it like a 10 business day
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
vers versus S calendar day I haven't
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
done the math in my head I don't have a
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
strong opinion on that either way and we
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
do generally keep the record open for 10
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
days and and if it's timely sometimes
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
we'll even accept it after that time
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
period if we can still act on it okay so
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
sure the best my knowledge is 10 days
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
because they literally give you the DAT
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
so if the public hearing is April 10th
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
they tell you by April 20th so it does
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
they don't really get into business or
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
calendar days yeah they just give it the
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
10 days and it would make sense I think
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
to keep it consistent then we wouldn't
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
be trying to guess if you went to public
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
hearing as opposed to another yeah and I
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
think if the if the requirement was
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
seven days and we're doing 10 anyway
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
probably just as a matter of policy
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
stick with that 10 so it's probably not
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
going to make a difference okay so if
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make a difference we
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
might as well keep it consistent for
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
everybody else who isn't oplc and
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't know these things sure all
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
right there's what you're going to do
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then there's if everybody knows that
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do is what you're
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
going to do so
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um all right well we actually have uh
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
enough people here to act on things now
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
so that's good we started without that
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
now we have it um so we don't actually
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
have to have the official amendment in
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um you guys can just
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
authorize me to go get the official
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh for the full committee
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
um but we should we should we should
 
00:55:20.029 --> 00:55:20.039 align:start position:0%
talk real briefly about the
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
overall legislation not just the
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
amendment but whether or not um the idea
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
of making sure that the public meetings
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
are notified no less than 14 calendar
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
days prior to the meeting uh everybody's
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
good with the actual substance of the
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
original bill um is anybody opposed to
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
the substance of the original
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so we seem good with that um
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
and then I would you know I think
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
probably the amendment is a good idea
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll entertain a motion from
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
369 representative Schmidt yeah okay we
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
are going to go to 10 yeah we're going
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
to go to 10 well you're making the
 
00:56:02.599 --> 00:56:03.589 align:start position:0%
to go to 10 well you're making the
motion

00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
sir yeah so we're going to go to 10 and
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt the amendment the
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
langu the language of the
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
amendment okay very good do I have a
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
second all right Resa Davis all in
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
favor all right we got four Z on
 
00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:22.589 align:start position:0%
favor all right we got four Z on
that

00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right we'll close up our time on 369
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
371 this is a fun
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
one actually once again I don't know I
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
feel like the RSA changed between the
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
last I don't even know what I was
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
looking at I made a couple comments and
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for the language in 32914
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't even find it so I think
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so um s SP
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
371 don't think do I have Amendment
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
language for this one for you guys I
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
so no I
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't representative yes I do did you
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
receive the email I sent you I did okay
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's two different compon
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's two different parts of this
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's the original intent of the
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and then there's all the
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that you said um we ran past the
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
speaker all of the other stuff that we'd
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
be considering is considered non gerain
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to hold a public hearing
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
which we might do I'm talking to the
 
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
chair about it um so really the in the
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of today's part of the
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting is just to talk
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
um intention of the bill and whether or
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
not we agree with that um and also we'll
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
take a look at the amended language that
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've proposed and see how we feel
 
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.670 align:start position:0%
you've proposed and see how we feel
about

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
um is the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
Association here for this one yes did
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
us yes uh she said she was going to be
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
here but she seems to be running a
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
little bit behind so she's on her way is
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
she okay we'll wait for her then yeah no
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
worries you can give her a few minutes
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
we've got an hour so I don't think it'll
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
take us that long if she's going to be
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
more than an hour then the answer is now
 
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:55.029 align:start position:0%
more than an hour then the answer is now
all

00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.039 --> 00:59:25.029 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:55.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.039 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
371 um the purpose of this is to create
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
a caveat for um resident Physicians um
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
2-year um renewal process for for lure
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
um so that it would basically well
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
technically depending on what language
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
we go with would give oplc rule making
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
authority to designate how long those
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
licenses would be for um but for so for
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
right now uh it's every license has to
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
be renewed every two years and they're
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
looking for an exception to that
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
essentially um so we have uh everybody
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
got I passed around the amended language
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
yes okay so everybody has that
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would start the
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
conversation um directed to Dartmouth
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
and the hospital
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
Association um which I asked ahead of
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
time one of the questions that came up
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing um and I know will
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
be an issue um it's an issue for me as
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
well is what is the specific hardship
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's being created um so if you have
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
that information that would be great if
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind sharing it sure I'm
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to put my mic on yep yeah so thank
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
you so much for the questions ahead of
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
time because it allowed me opportunity
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
to connect with our medical staff office
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm a I'm a licensed attorney by
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
training and I have to renew my license
 
01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:40.839 align:start position:0%
every year and so when the question was
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
asked of me I thought the same thing
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
like well wait a minute can't um these
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
individual people just renew their
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
license and take responsibility for it
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
but I was quickly corrected and reminded
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we have over
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
450 resident physician um providers who
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
are really the backbone of the providers
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
not actual resident Physicians resident
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
Physicians lenses who are who are
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
providers who are doctors and they're
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
really the backbone of the medical
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
center in terms of overnights on call
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
when you think about receiving Care at
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
an academic Medical Center you're
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
receiving robust care and really that's
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
because you're receiving care from res
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
training resident Physicians and so um
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
our resident Physicians are working well
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
over 80 hours a week they're doing those
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
odd hours you know nights weekends
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
holidays Etc and so the one thing we can
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
give them is administrative support and
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
to to um help them with their license
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
and I just want to um we are so grateful
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
for the work that was done on House Bill
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
655 last legislative session so thank
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
you to this committee all the work that
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
oplc did to really streamline licensing
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
um sincerely I mean we we we take all we
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
took it sincerely I was just responding
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
to duck space that's all I know you did
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of work but flash there are some
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
when we have a large over overhaul like
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
that sometimes there are pieces that we
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
just forget that should stay the same or
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
that could could stay the same and I
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
think this was just one of those that
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of fell through the cracks so
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're really just looking to ensure that
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
we can continue status quo and continue
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
to license these providers in that kind
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
of bundled way as opposed to
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
streamlining them in the every two-year
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
licensing processes so during the public
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
hearing you had mentioned in your
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
testimony that it could be up to seven
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
years but most licenses are three to
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
three to five three to five three to
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
five in particular um so we're looking
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
at maybe one to two renewals per
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
person yes over the over the term so as
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to just having it for the entire
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
length of their residence residency
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
their we may have to renew it once or
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
twice um because obviously the initial
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
one is going to be the initial one no
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
matter what we we do
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
um Mr
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
UT what does the renewal process look
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
like now under
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
oplc how long how long of a process is
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
it to renew a medical license what do
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
they have to do so typically uh we're
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
going to notify a licy 60 days out and
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
then they it varies from board to board
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we're working on consolidating that
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
process but there's a universal
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
application form under the PLC 400s that
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
has standard information name birth date
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
that type of stuff and then whatever the
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
board specific requirements are but once
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
you send that in and you get it to us um
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have to take a look at that within 30
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
days if there's any problems with it we
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
notify the applicant uh so they get a
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
chance to cure once we have a full
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
application and it typically comes in
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
right away that way um we can sometimes
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
get it done same day but I would say two
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
week stops
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to gauge is how long
 
01:06:59.309 --> 01:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to take the administrative
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
offices to fill out a renewal form I
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
know that the state has become very
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
streamlined in a lot of things and the
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
ones that I get for my business like the
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
licensing renewals are really easy at
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
this point um some of them take me
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
literally a minute to fill out and send
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
back in and so that's the other part of
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
the hardship that I'm just trying to
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
gauge from the hospitals perspective is
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
so you've got 450 but that's scattered
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
over how many institutions that's just a
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
dart that's just a Dartmouth our Medical
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
Center that's just Dartmouth yep so
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's just our Medical Center we also
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
have um resident training programs at
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
Cheshire and then I I can't I don't
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
represent the other hospitals but there
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
are programs across the state so Ben can
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
speak to the other programs yeah if you
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
would mind yeah so if you don't mind I'm
 
01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:45.470 align:start position:0%
would mind yeah so if you don't mind I'm
just

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
mik while Ben I'm G to give him some
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
Grace while he's digging out I just have
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
a couple things to to know so we um
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
we're in as of the summer of 2024 we're
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
going to have 462 lenses just at the
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
medical center and I just want to note
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
that um as as Doug has noted these are
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
rolling and so the renewals are going to
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
be done every other odd year I believe
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
but then we're every year we're going to
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
have resident trainees that are coming
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
in so for the administrative burden for
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
our Med Staff office is going to be
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
tracking those annually then tracking
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
which ones are are going to be renewed
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
every other year when did they start so
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes in in 2024 they're
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to be renewed in
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
2025 or 2027 so there's a there's a a
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
rolling process here where it would be
 
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
much more um it'd be much easier for us
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
frankly to um in license a resident for
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the length of their residency as we do
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
in current
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
practice um so I got this from uh some
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
information about Portsmith hospitals
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
Residency program I do not have
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
conquered hospitals Residency program um
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
um there are eight Family Medicine
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
residents that are there for three years
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so a total of 24 Family Medicine
 
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
um so a total of 24 Family Medicine
residents

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:19.750 align:start position:0%
residents
 
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:22.789 align:start position:0%
residents
[Music]

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
um you're speaking just a portion
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
yes that's right okay um and they just
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
established their program not too long
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
ago um so building upon
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um appears there are 24
 
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
um appears there are 24
for

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry and 30 for Internal
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh from Portsmith Hospital okay
 
01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:59.229 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh from Portsmith Hospital okay
great

01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if oplc would have an
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
official number at if you needed an
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
official number of how many lenses you
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking at and it I don't expect
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
that now we didn't really go over that
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
but you know to look at a full spectrum
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
the other I I mean the other important
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
question well first off does
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members have any questions
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
at this point before I keep bling on
 
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
at this point before I keep bling on
okay

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
um has there been any harm done
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
because the two-year process would would
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
create some level of accountability to
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
review right I mean is there any harm
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
done by allowing the license to go for
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
as long as it has over the years that
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's been doing that it's my
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that there hasn't and um
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
there certainly are checks and balances
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
that are in place aside from licensing
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
including Insurance credentialing our
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
internal policies and procedures so I
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
would say that to answer your question
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
directly the net benefit including
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
supporting our Workforce streamlining
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
our business operations far out outweigh
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
any potential concern because there's
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
been no documented concern to dat if I
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
may too um Courtney am I mistaken that
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
previous to the five 655 bill um
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
residents were recognized for the term
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
of their residency it's just since the
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
two-year has been enacted so it's not a
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
foreign concept yeah that's why I was
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
saying historically have we had any
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem with that kind of Licensing
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
because it's a general rule of the aisle
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
is basically like heyy you know like
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
hands off as much as possible unless
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
Harm's being done sure so um and so
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good argument for me
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
personally is all I'm saying but yes
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
Peter thank you Mr chair so uh I I just
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that I understand so
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
typically as part of uh medical training
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
as I understand it is when they finish
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
medical school then they are eligible
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
for residency then they find a place
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
that is is uh interested in hiring them
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh and they are going to be then they
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
are they come on board they they are
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
going to be as part of their training
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be practicing medicine
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
under the direct supervision right of uh
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
at least at the very beginning direct
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
supervision of a a a of a
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
mature uh Doctor Who
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
been doing this for years let's say okay
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and so they would then uh get a
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
license as part of the process we're
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
talking about um and that and that
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
license and their residency would last
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
for what three years we talking about
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
generally yeah it depends on the
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
duration of their residency as if we're
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the current practice how
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've done it here in New Hampshire it
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
depends on the duration of their
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
residency the Board of Medicine licensed
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
them for the the duration of their
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
residency so for example a family
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
practice um a family practice resident
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
um will have a residency for three years
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
a surgeon could have a a specialty
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon could have a residency for up to
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
right yes and you're right they do
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
practice under um supervision and
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
guidance of an attendee and their
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
license is a resident license right
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
right um the other thing to keep in mind
 
01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
is given that the programs are three to
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
five to seven years kind of odd-numbered
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
years when you apply a license for two
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
years you've
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
essentially um afforded them the the
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
license of a residence for maybe an
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
additional year if you were to have to
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
renew every two years do you see what
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying with the the way the math
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
Works um you start on year one if you
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
are expected to um fulfill a a um um
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
subsequent license for residency to
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
complete your last year that residency
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
license is good for two years it just
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't match up with the term of the
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
programs so that's the other thing that
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
makes it more in line with the way
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
things work for a Residency
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
ahead suppose a
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
resident doesn't finish their residency
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
in their skill what if they want to move
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
to another
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
hospital where they start over again did
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
they take a competency exam what's
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
what's the story and how would they how
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
would oplc deal with something like that
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is a great question I I'd have to
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on that question I
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't have all the answers it's a great
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
question I I I would just say that the
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
license is for that person um it's not
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed as a Dartmouth
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
Health Medical Center resident they're
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
licensed as a resident in New Hampshire
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and so I would suspect that their their
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
resident license could be you know they
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
would carry that with them to Portsmith
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
or conquer where there's another
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
Residency program I don't you know
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's my guess but now let still
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh the people in
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
residency is it going to affect their
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
ability to take uh board
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
certification um I'm not sure about that
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
I mean everyone has to make individual
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
decisions right about where they they
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
work and then where they're going when
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to sit for their boards um
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that okay but they
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
would be licensed for that period for
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
that institution right so well they
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
would be licensed for that period for
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
their residency proper not there's
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
nothing on their license that says
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
they're a Dartmouth Hitchcock resident
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
it just says Jane Smith resident
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
physician license the the license just
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
just for clarification because I might
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
answer your question Peter in in statute
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as that agreement is terminated
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
so does the license
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
right but I mean that that's the idea
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
they would be coming on board uh at that
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
institution even if it doesn't say but
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
they would have some kind of a contract
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
for the institu for in this case for
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth But but so I'm I'm familiar at
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
least with the concept of residency but
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh but we're talk we also said
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh you said what and what did
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
you say about conquered Ben conquered
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
hospital they have a program too they
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
have a program to how about one with
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
Douglas in in Dober no um there are
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
other uh in there is interest in in
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
additional residency programs in the
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
future at various uh sites um I think
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
there was a proposal in
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
403 uh to create a Residency program in
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
the North Country um so you know the
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
idea is when you can bring providers out
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
of school to New Hampshire give them
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
that exposure to our state uh the hope
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
is they would stay and and be here and
 
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make it as easy for them as
 
01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.110 align:start position:0%
we want to make it as easy for them as
possible

01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a question to the
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of the institution to have the
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
workforce that they need because uh you
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
know for example I understand if you're
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
working kind of that's the you know not
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
as a stranger uh movie you know they're
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
working kind of Around the Clock it's
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
kind of like uh
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
grueling right but you need people at
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
all hours because people have accidents
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
there are crimes committed or you know
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
whatever Around the Clock you need to
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
have somebody there available at in the
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
middle of the night as well as work
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
business hours right so it's important
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
to have the people there uh and and and
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
Al also it's not like uh you have
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
something where you have a standard
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
practice somebody comes in whatever
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
their medical emergency is requires that
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
team uh to be working on them for as
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
long as it takes to stabilize them save
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
them whatever um and admit them and so
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
forth uh and that could be
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
for it it can't be limited to a specific
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
time period right they've got to be
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
there for that person as long as it
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
takes and if they're and longer
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes right Peter Peter to be fair
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
I've never heard a resident complain
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
work I have so
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
anyway I read it in a book years ago I
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
saw it in a movie years ago um but but
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
anyway the thing is that it's it's to
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of the institution to have
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
people available on in those under those
 
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.910 align:start position:0%
people available on in those under those
circumstances

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh but it's also uh to the advantage of
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
the individual practicing physician to
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
be able to have a place to go to and
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
continue their training program uh but
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
also they're making a living right off
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
the bat and so forth or getting paid for
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
it anyway and one additional element
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative the community the
 
01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
community benefits from the well clear
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
clearly the community benefits from
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
having uh Hospital there that's one of
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
the reasons for example when the
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
question of the continuation of frisbee
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh as an institution there was
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
some talk of them
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
closing uh and I remember thinking you
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
know here's the community of Rochester
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
30,000 people roughly few thousand more
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh and over 10 11 miles away similar
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
population and suddenly the
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital frisbee potentially closing
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
down now all those people are suddenly
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to go 11 more miles uh to
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
come to Dover or go someplace else uh
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
for their treatment and that clearly
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
would not be in the interest of the
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
community bring it back to the point of
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
attack that you raised um but the thing
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
is uh so this is a traditional thing uh
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I I think of Dartmouth as a training
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
institution that's where they're
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
studying me medicine at Dartmouth uh but
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have a similar situation in
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth to my knowledge uh so they
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
would be and you said it's not happening
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
at at Wentworth Douglas uh it is
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
happening at conquer so um but I was not
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that we were doing
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
residency uh in in Dover which is why I
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
asking you said that's a negatory um but
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
conquered and and yes yes okay uh but
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's a they come in and they would be at
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
that Institution for that period of time
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and presupposing that everything
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
is going well they'd be there for that
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
period and to have a license and a for
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
residency for that period would
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
obviously be advantageous and not have
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
to renew during that
 
01:21:26.639 --> 01:21:29.669 align:start position:0%
to renew during that
period

01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
again thank you Peter um yeah the ARG
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
can be made that it would be better for
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who's practicing to not have to
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
renew their license but
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh no I know I'm just playing with you
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
Peter um so one other question that I
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
have before we get into the kind of guts
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself to make sure that it
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
actually functions um fees
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
dug for this type of license
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
Anya I don't know off the top of my head
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look at the 102s but if it
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
was traditionally done so two comments
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
one if it was traditionally done the
 
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
one if it was traditionally done the
other

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
way we probably wouldn't notice much
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
difference financially and I think the
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
other comment is and this would probably
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
come from the governor's office too uh
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
right licensing is for public protection
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
not for fee
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
generation you're speaking to my heart
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
tub yeah you've been with me long enough
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
I hear you just covering all the basis
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
well no because it was 200 bucks per
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
license it um it has they have to be
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
licensed right one way or the other have
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
to be licensed so the the license is
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
there for Public Safety but the cost of
 
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
it gets shifted to other people if it's
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
not being collected from one group it
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
has to cover the cost of the board so
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be cover it's going to be
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
collected at 450 resident Physicians for
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
for Dartmouth if it were $200 you're
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
talking $90,000 every renewal cycle and
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's a really good point
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of shared costs
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
right for disciplined prosecutors having
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
the hearings officers those kinds of
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
things and that wouldn't necessarily be
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
covered after that initial license now
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
again speaking not I'm not the fan
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
Finance guy but but that is a good point
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
to race if you could just get me that
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
information just so I have it that' be
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
helpful I'm not sure that it'll be a
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
determining Factor at all I just like to
 
01:23:16.199 --> 01:23:17.070 align:start position:0%
determining Factor at all I just like to
have

01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah so if we're going to have it for
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
three years instead of the typical
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
license so we're going to prate the uh
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
the cost for on the on the basis of
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
getting a longer license it's going to
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
cost more right I think we would have to
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
reflect on what's done been done in the
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
past um and maybe work with oplc to see
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
what that looks like but that's a that's
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
an that's an interesting idea though
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
Peter I hadn't thought about that that's
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying what do you what do you
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
Doug that's something I'd have to run by
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
Lindsay but potentially exist if we're
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to account for seven years
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
worth of time instead of two it it might
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
adjusted it's a good
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
point we're not going to have the same
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
price for two years as for three years
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
or seven years that that makes no sense
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
to not to me
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
anyway if I may it may just be wise to
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at how it had been done
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
historically yeah um yeah that's all
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking yeah no absolutely I mean
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
not not that people usually complain
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
about the pay at that once You' reach
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
that level but it would probably be I'm
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming Physicians and surgeons
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
would pick up the rest of the tab so
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
they'd be picking it up in their Futures
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to in the present but um okay
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
so there's that component of it all
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
right so now if I may unless there's any
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
other comments on
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
the content of the bill or the intent of
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
the bill from the
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um if you want to look at
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
the draft legislation I I looked at this
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
for a bit this morning and I think um
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
what Doug's written up makes a lot of
 
01:24:59.639 --> 01:25:01.149 align:start position:0%
what Doug's written up makes a lot of
sense

01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
um basically in in number two it just
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
says that licenses shall be valid for
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
two years from the date of issuance
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
except for Physicians residency licenses
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
and Apprentice licenses for the two The
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
Apprentice licenses were already in this
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
section um we'd be adding The Physician
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
residency licenses to it the duration of
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
the physician residency licenses and
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
appr Apprentice licenses shall be
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
established by the office according uh
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
in accordance with 541a timely income
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it goes on from there um if we were
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to go with this language Doug I had a
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
question right off the bat for you um
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
3294 what was
 
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.430 align:start position:0%
3294 what was
it

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
32945 C says this it says training
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
licenses shall be confir uh confined to
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
activities performed in the course of
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
the qualifying residency or graduate
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
Fellowship training program we'd want to
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
keep that shall expire automatically
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
upon licenses SE lenes separation from
 
01:25:59.790 --> 01:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
The Residency or graduate Fellowship
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
training program for any reason it may
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
be issued on a restricted or conditional
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
basis so we would have that in
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
statute and you would also have rule
 
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.870 align:start position:0%
statute and you would also have rule
making

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
Authority would that that could
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
potentially be conflicting well we could
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
we could always Draft rules in
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
accordance with the statute okay so it'
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
be fine to to leave it there and then
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
that would be the guidance for you
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
setting it okay that's fine I just
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
weren't doing yeah Steve go
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah I think this is a little
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
confus the apprenticeship licenses now
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the electricians we
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
were talking about in the hearing is
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct because
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're already in 310 8 as an
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
exception so they'd have to stay in 3108
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
as an exception we would just be adding
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
The Physician residency licenses to do
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
we want to put in apprentice license
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
electrician apprentice licenses do we
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
need to do that that or just we're
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
assuming now how's that kind of I think
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
so far it's working I I don't know if we
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
need the clarification is I is it
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
limited to just Steve may know better
 
01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
than I do is it limited to just
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
electricians or do does anybody else
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
have a one-year apprenticeship right now
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
I I think we're the only that have the
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
one year they have single year but they
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
let I think mechanical lets it go for
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
two years or doesn't doesn't really
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
check ours just says you got to show
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
that you've done the schooling before
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
you can get it again it's always been
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
that way so we just if you give it to
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
your license since they don't actually
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
show they've done the schooling it's
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
going to really mess up that whole
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
process so right yeah I don't think
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to be
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
like well The Apprentice licensing well
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
see that's a good point Steve because
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
right now it's one year for that and
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be like clamoring to
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
have to renew more often but if it's not
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
laid out in statutes somebody could
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
potentially start a licensing program
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
and have a way around it but then it it
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
would have to go through
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
rules correct and and wouldn't
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
if and I'm just asking if you leave it
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
like it is given the ability of somebody
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
else want to change it to that not
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
having to come back and do it as opposed
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
to just saying electrical apprentices it
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
gives them the ability to deal with any
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
apprentices throughout the oplc if they
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
change it so I would think it's best
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
just left like it is
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
but as long as we can address our issue
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to fight for everybody
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
else anything else do it' be a different
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
chapter for electrical than for any
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
other so it be different chapter but it
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a wouldn't be a bad thing to
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
put the extra word in there so um I'll
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
just sort out there real quick again uh
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we're we're really laidback
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
during this subcommittee meeting still
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
just come through the chair because so I
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
don't jump over people I just I'm sorry
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
I have to go I'm still working on that
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
being in two places at once thing but I
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
haven't mastered it so I have to hop
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
back over to the state house any other
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
question yes my name is Courtney
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
Tanner we have it here I can I can in
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
touch with you if I do text me call me
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
email me thank you for getting the
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
information you did it was very helpful
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so much thank you
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
for your work on this
 
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
yep ad you said you were on your way
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
the technically she was late but that's
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Courtney appreciate it
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
um any anything else on the language
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
that proposed in this amendment I think
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's cleaner than the original Bill
 
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.550 align:start position:0%
it's cleaner than the original Bill
personally

01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that it I'm not sure it
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
actually changes anything I'm not 100%
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
sure Doug do you have thoughts on what
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
it was changing there was one thing in
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
there what was it that I felt like was
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
different well Doug you're going to be
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
looking at this right you're going to be
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this and if
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
any thoughts occur to you you'll get
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
back to us yes there I I don't know if
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
you want to move on but I did want a
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
flag and you and I had discussed it in
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate right now um House Bill 1622
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 518 both have bills that
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
are amending this same paragraph so
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
right now we have three bills amending
 
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
the same paragraph my recommendation in
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate was to pull it out of 1622
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and just move that language over to 518
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
but now we've also got this to contend
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
with if their decision here I could also
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
potentially work this language into that
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
and just get it all in one place
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
depending on the decisions made um just
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
putting that out there because we've got
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
it we've got three we've got three bills
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
with three different RSA 3108 paragraph
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
twos sure so what you're saying as
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to pushing SP 371 through just
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
take the language attach it to are both
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
of those bills in the Senate both of
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
those bills in the Senate right I don't
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
understood uh um the other thing I could
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
do is grab the language from that we
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
worked on with doj for
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
1622 and we could drop it in here and I
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
could just put this language the problem
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
the things are the only well the only
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
other thing to take into consideration
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
is the potential for adding the other
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
language that you that we've talked
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
about um which would which would be a
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
standalone Bill we have to have a public
 
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on it if we do
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
this would fit in with that
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
um maybe if we can just make sure that
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
we work together to make sure the
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
language doesn't conflict in its final
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay state that and I'll just put
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
together one paragraph that kind of
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
merges the three sure and then we should
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
be in a good place okay um because I did
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
want to give some consideration
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
to um and we'll talk to Lindsay about it
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
but I do want to give some consideration
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
to a price adjustment if we if we go
 
01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
ahead with this
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
um just so that it's reasonable um we'll
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
be saving them time but you know they'll
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
be deferring the costs for other
 
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:04.830 align:start position:0%
be deferring the costs for other
providers

01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
um any other comments at this
 
01:32:08.719 --> 01:32:10.950 align:start position:0%
um any other comments at this
point

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
from you coordinate yeah is anybody just
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
flat out against the
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
idea of of opening up this exception for
 
01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.390 align:start position:0%
idea of of opening up this exception for
Resident

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
Resident
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians okay so the subcommittee is
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
working under the assumption that we're
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee we're okay with the
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
overall concept of the bill we just have
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
those few things that we may want to
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
work in then we'll call another
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting with a with an
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
amendment we can take a look at an
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
official Amendment and go from there no
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
no I want because I'm nodding but I
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
can't see whether I can't see whether
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to get your attention because
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
you were looking that
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
dire okay very good well then I will say
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll move in that direction seeing
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no evidence of harm being
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
caused by the longer licensing over time
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's any reason not to do that it is
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
kind of a unique set of
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances um as long as we in my
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
opinion as long as we're willing to
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
adjust the licensing fee component of it
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
accurate um unless Lindsay has something
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
to say about that that I'm unaware of uh
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
and then we'll probably just SP for your
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
edification um we have other language
 
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
coming uh that oplc has recommended we
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
may have a public hearing on and attach
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
it to this it's not in any way going to
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
be something that's going to put this at
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
risk so um it's pretty General stuff
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
language fixes and things of that nature
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
so well and
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
Steve yeah the four of us oh
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
Sor we we really appreciate your support
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
on this thank
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
you all right guys end of that and we've
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
got an hour and a half until regular
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
