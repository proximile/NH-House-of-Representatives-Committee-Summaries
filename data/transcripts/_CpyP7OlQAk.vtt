tastings um I am aware that there is
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
another bill on the Senate on excuse me
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
across the wall that is basically the
 
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.629 align:start position:0%
across the wall that is basically the
same

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
thing um and that basically is about it
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
this uh bill allows a 1 half ounce
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
sample per label per person for any
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
question which is a distilled
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
Spirit um and that is
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
nutshell so uh Pam I'm not sure where
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's coming from because everybody
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
else is pretty well muted but right I lo
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
did the same thing I see everybody muted
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
I I don't know either but I'll keep an
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
eye out just worry whether we're getting
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
our wires crossed in the committee room
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
with some other committee but all right
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
so we do have questions uh and we have
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ben hton
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair and good
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
morning representative pusk um I have a
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the at the bill
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
at the moment and I'll read you a
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
sentence that is of concern to me it's
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
the very last sentence of the bill
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
proper it says such prod project
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
products I'm sorry such products may be
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
sold at retail at a farmer's market in
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
the original containers that doesn't
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
sound like a sample to me well that is
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
well that's not the sample that is like
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh the other manufacturers which sell
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
bottles of wine cans or bottles of beer
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they will have bottles of their
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
product which they can sell that is not
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
a sample the sample is basically on on
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
any of these uh alcoholic products
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
is to uh provide some
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
information to the possible consumer on
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
what the taste of the product
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
is uh if you can have sales of wine
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
sales of beer you should also be able to
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
Spirits okay further question yes follow
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
up if I may please um maybe it's just
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
the wording and and do get hung up on
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
Words and don't apologize for that
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
because of who I am in my background but
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
it does sound as though that does deal
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
with samples I don't know if anyone else
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
sees it that way actually in the
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
previous sentence it does say they can
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
charge for
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
samples it says may offer samples as
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
provided but then when it says products
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
sold at retail at a farmer's market in
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
the original containers that doesn't
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
sound like a sample to me that sounds
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
like a market oh that's correct no it's
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
when they're going to bring they're
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to bring their regular product
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
with them and that they're going to sell
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
sample they're going to open a bottle or
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
whatever sell the samples or give away
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
the sample but then if the uh person
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
who's at the farmers's market would like
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
to take one home they uh the old the old
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
days well not for distill but the old
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
days with wine they used to have to go
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
to the liquor store to get it and we had
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
gen changed the policy that um yes they
 
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.749 align:start position:0%
gen changed the policy that um yes they
can

00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
bring um whether it's beer and wine now
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
and this this will add distilled Liquors
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
they can bring a product with them and
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
sell it at the farmers market so the the
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
term retail may be a little confusing
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
but it's it implied to mean is that no
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
you wholesale you got to go through the
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
you got to go through the Liquor
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
Commission but that you can sell the
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
product so for the question thank you no
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
I at the risk of of just being a little
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
bit um specific here it does say and I
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
agree with what you're saying and I
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
agree that that's the intent I don't
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that but the
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
previous sentence says may offer samples
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say such products
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
I suggest that there might be some
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
wording that be would be looked at there
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
because I do understand the intent of
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
the bill and I I was part of the
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
commission from which this arose so um
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
just to just to throw that out I do
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's ambiguous and that's just
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
me so you're saying such products so you
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say such uh distilled liquor
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
rather than saying probably yeah that
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
would probably be a better wording if if
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
anyone agrees with me or disagrees with
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
me I'll be happy to um simply back out
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
of this conversation and let it continue
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
without me thank you very much okay okay
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
you can put your hand down and
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett you were next
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
know sorry I lowered my hand okay great
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
Herbert I'm M um when you when you say a
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
retail um my question is uh um um is
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
when you say sell at retail is the uh is
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
the State Liquor Commission going to be
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
able to uh uh gain a a a income as when
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
they sell there
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay thank
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
you and uh representative
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
peros yes thank you for taking my
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
question um just just a quick one um
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
under current law would the farmers
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
markets be required to take
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
from people to ensure that they're of
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
legal age particularly I'm more
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about the takeaways than the
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the small samples but will they be
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
taking ID so
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead John typically yes I I I
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
am on the board of directors of the
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
Dairy Farmers Market and we have beer
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
and wine tastings at our markets and
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
yes the answer is unequivocally yes
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
excellent if you go in the whole area is
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
roped off special you can't even go in
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
the area unless you're like a kid that
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
goes with their parents and the IDS are
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
check perfect thank you okay
 
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:14.829 align:start position:0%
check perfect thank you okay
representative

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
Fargo um yes thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
think that this is a good idea to
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
promote local wineries and distilleries
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
and things like that I think that's
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
really nice but I don't see anything in
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
the Bild that re stricks it to made in
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so um any does that mean
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
that any wine
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
or uh manufacturer from anywhere in the
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
country or anywhere at all could come
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
and um sell their liquor beer or wine at
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
market interesting uh there will the
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
answer is no the answer is no the the
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
the secret is that it says liquor
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but it doesn't restrict it
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
to New Hamp I'm that's restricted you
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
don't have out ofate manufacturers
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're manufactured outstate but they
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
have a different kind of
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
license okay thank you also um we're
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
going to have testimony from one of our
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
folks from The Liquor Commission so if
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
you want to bring that question up I'm
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
quite sure uh M Mo will be very happy to
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay we all said everybody said okay
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
Aiden you're
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
on good morning uh committee members can
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay we can hear you great
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much good morning
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and committee members nice
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
to see you this year virtually um I
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh uh rep answer
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
representative Fargo's um question and
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
and also bring to you uh bring to you
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
your attention that at the same time
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you're taking up this bill Senate
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 18 is working its way uh through
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
the system which has uh an an exactly uh
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
similar purpose for allowing uh tastings
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh of uh liquor at farmers markets um
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think is worth
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
noting is that farmers markets have a
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
great deal of control at the local level
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
so um a manufacturer whether it's beer
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
or wine or Spirits in this case would
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
have to go to the local community and uh
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
apply for and get local approval under
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
the terms of which uh the tap tastings
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
and samplings were to take place uh so
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
that that is always part of the
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
process the uh concern about having um
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
instate manufacturers was actually
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
raised in the
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and as a part of that the bill
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
was amended there to include language
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
that says a liquor manufacturer that
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
produces less than 10,000
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
bottles during their licensing Year and
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
that operates and produces liquor solely
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
within the state may transport its
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
products to farmers markets and may
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
offer samples as provided in this
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh I think the commission felt
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with that and uh and to
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh support the original intent which is
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
to allow New Hampshire
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um the opportunity uh to
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
preclude go ahead was that you Aiden
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
um that's the chairman calling me um I
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
think he doesn't like what I said I
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
text yes so uh we would we would
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
encourage uh that if if the Senate Bill
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
18 makes its way that there' be possibly
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.150 align:start position:0%
18 makes its way that there' be possibly
some

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
reconciliation in the language um that
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
would limit the participants to those
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
who produce less than a certain
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
quantity and who are limited to being
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire producers uh as well I'm
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's answered your
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
question representative Fargo but I'm
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions from from
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions from from
the

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
committee okay do you have anything else
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
you want to on your testimony or you
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
just here to uh that's that's it
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
inquire uh yes I I wanted to uh
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
ask uh whether uh liquor
 
00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:00.309 align:start position:0%
ask uh whether uh liquor
uh

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers under under this bill um
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
are um are whether there's um
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
correspondence are are are the
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
arrangements the same for uh for other
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
beverages that uh The Liquor Commission
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
oversees in other words we I didn't want
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
to see us have a bill that where we had
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
different rules for different categories
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
are the CATE are they all treated
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
equivalently thank you for your question
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative AEL uh the the bill seeks
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
to amend the um provision that deals
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
with tastings for wine and beverages so
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh it would be consistent with with what
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
exists uh for the other two
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
areas yeah if you look at the sentence
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
um you'll see it's just adding on to the
 
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.910 align:start position:0%
um you'll see it's just adding on to the
sentence

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
or okay representative Fargo uh thank
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um could you
 
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
tell me what that Senate bill number is
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
again it would be Senate Bill 18 18
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Aiden you're
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
welcome and representative MCL um Mr
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
Moore uh do you have any idea how many
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh distillers there are in New Hampshire
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's number one uh number two would it
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
if there's not that many would it maybe
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
make sense to include that same
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
limitation on bottles but uh include
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
neighboring states so that would include
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
Massachusetts

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
um we I can't tell you ex the exact
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
number I can get back to you with that
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
number representative for the exact
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
number of distillers in New Hampshire uh
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
sure um that the farmers market the
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the farmers market is to
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
promote products from outside of the
 
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
promote products from outside of the
state

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's uh representative
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
pusk um and uh you know was part of the
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
and representative van hton were part of
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
the commission on what we call I guess
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol tourism and um the I believe the
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to promote New
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manufacturers um versus
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers from outside of the state
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so I I I think leaving it the way it
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
is in the sense of who would be eligible
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
to participate um is is consistent with
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
other uh aspects of this uh legislation
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh so for example if you were going to
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
allow it for out ofate then you'd need
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
to go back and change it for wine you
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
need to go back to change it for beer
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
and and that would uh create probably
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
quite a conundrum for the local
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.630 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%

representing the New Hampshire Wine and
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
Spirits Brokers Association which is the
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
larger brokers who
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
Market uh distilled spirits and wine to
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Liquor Commission and
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
while this bill applies to small instate
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
distilleries uh we are in support of the
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
version that uh has been worked on in
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I wanted to make you
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
aware that Senate Bill 18 um my
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
recollection from the work session that
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
took place in the Senate Commerce
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
Committee is that all of the
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were supportive of the
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
changes and that bill has actually
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate a week and a half ago
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
and is on its way to the house um at
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
crossover so it's already passed uh the
 
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
crossover so it's already passed uh the
Senate

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and as you've heard that bill made a
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
couple of additional safeguards that
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
aren't in the house version that
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the goals of the small
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
local distilleries of giving them the
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do wine tastings just
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
like local breweries and wineries can do
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
at farmers markets and to sell their
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
product um at those uh farmers markets
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
and um the changes had as I mentioned I
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
think had the support of all the
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the bill um I really think
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
the bill that's before you today isn't
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
necessary because Senate Bill 18 um has
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
been amended and it's on its way to you
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation would be to itl
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 162 and support Senate Bill
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
118 when it comes over from the
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:31.549 align:start position:0%
118 when it comes over from the
Senate

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay I guess you're you're neutral I see
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
that now I read the wrong column okay uh
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
deur okay seeing none we thank you very
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and is there anybody who is
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:00.549 align:start position:0%
 
speak

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
hands getting
 
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.149 align:start position:0%
hands getting
raised

00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
so um I'll close the public hearing and
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh so uh Pam sent you guys all the the
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
blue sheet so you can see it if you want
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
to print it U I recommend uh reducing
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
your printer to tell it to reduce to 80%
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that way you can get everything on
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
the page and um you can see that sort 18
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
support two or neutral one oppos and I
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
believe that's fry from new Futures I
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
suppose but did not want to
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
testify okay with that I will close the
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
162 so the next one's at 9:30 okay so we
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
have six
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
hunt yes
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
sorry yes cor the next two the next two
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
bills seem to me to be related they are
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
very much related and I'm just I'm a
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
little uh I
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
just I mean one is talks to relative to
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
food and cigar shops the other one
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
relative to on prom on premises cigar
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
beverage and liquor
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
licenses so it it sounds to me as though
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
number one one of them wants to be able
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
to uh sell liquor and then the other one
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to also sell
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
food so I I don't understand seem to be
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
a that's why we have a public hearing so
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
you can a conflict of purposes there two
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
bills two different things
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
but business um I mean you could say
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
that uh and I know that we did in the
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
past where we try to do piggyback
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
hearings you know when um uh and I I
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
find it sometimes confusing to do that
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
piggyback thing and try to do things at
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
the same time I realized it was supposed
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
to be a timesaver but I'm not sure it is
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's more if you have the
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
same people were testifying both bills
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
then then you say make you only have to
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
get up and say it once but uh in this
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
case um one one is very simple and very
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
small and and um targeted on an issue
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the other one opens up a uh U to be
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
frank open up a can of worms so so
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's why I felt that they should have
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
separate public
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
hearings but we'll see that's why we
 
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
hearings but we'll see that's why we
have

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.470 align:start position:0%
 
hearings

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.510 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

and I'm going to
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
be

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
just so you know I think that sound that
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
you may be hearing is the the um air
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
system in the committee room just turned
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
off but they kind of cycle on and off a
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
little bit and they do sound like a you
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
know crowd noise or something a roar of
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
a crowd for a little while but
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually I think it's their the new Air
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
Purifiers in the room too because we
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
there they uh they cycled on and off
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
differently than the air system did
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
too right right the little it's a it's a
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
new sound for us so and if you haven't
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
been in the
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
room you might not know what it is is is
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
there any way we can turn off the
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
microphone in the committee room because
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
you're right it's
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
distracting we could but the only way to
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
turn it back on is to run down there and
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
do it and and I I know nobody's in the
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
room right now but somebody could appear
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
so it's from our
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee from your committee I mean I
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
know that um representative Osborne came
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
in for the exec last
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
time so I don't think it'll If it
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
creates a big problem you know I can I
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
can U mute it but I'd prefer to to leave
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
it as is because I think most of the
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if you're trying to talk to us
 
00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:39.630 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if you're trying to talk to us
you're

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
muted so there's some black thing
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
sitting on the chair in the back of the
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
room there because at first I thought
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
maybe there was somebody there turned
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
sideways but I guess there's did you
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
leave a jack your jacket on the chair
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
there John nope I have everything with
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
me um maybe that's just turned sideways
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
there's a large desktop computer there
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
they put in some desktop computers that
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
might be what you're
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
seeing Oh okay I'm not sure Del is a
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
screen it could be a screen yeah okay
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
all right it's 9:30 we'll open up the
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in House Bill
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
171 and hear from the prime sponsor
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative pusk good morning again
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
represent pus good morning again Mr
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
chair and ladies and gentlemen uh my
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague on the Commerce
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
Committee I am here to present House
 
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.310 align:start position:0%
Committee I am here to present House
Bill

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
17 relative to food in cigar shops it's
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
actually it
 
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.430 align:start position:0%
actually it
removes

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
removes
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me it it says quote does not
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
allow cigarette smoking
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
or service and what does it removes
 
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
or service and what does it removes
service

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
it replaces it with the sale of food
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
which means if you go to a cigar shop uh
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
they may have snacks on the counter that
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
you may partake in for zero
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
cost therefore they are providing but
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
not selling and that's all this does and
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
I think you'll agree with me that if
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
you're going to be going to a cigar St
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
store or shop which I don't do
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
personally but if you do I know folks
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
that do they have
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh things there that you can
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
try and you have your cigar and as long
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
as you have something in your stomach
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
when if you are drinking a beverage it
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
makes it better for that beverage to be
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh assimilated into your body rather
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
than have nothing as a snack so that's
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
basically all all it is it changes one
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
service to sale and prohibits the sale
 
00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:08.430 align:start position:0%
service to sale and prohibits the sale
of

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
testimony okay are there any questions
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
members

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing none uh this time we'll
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
do a little bit differently so uh will
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
Curtis uh Barry would like to testify to
 
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.830 align:start position:0%
Curtis uh Barry would like to testify to
the

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
bill good morning good morning good
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Curtis Barry
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
here this morning uh on behalf of the
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cigar
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
Association um in support of the bill
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
and as representer pusk mentioned it's a
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
very simple change uh I hope you all
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
received either by US mail or email um
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
the documents I sent with the backup
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
with the with the statute which I think
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
is important to get the full context of
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
this so when um the statute was
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
originally passed in order to make sure
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
that a cigar bar did not become a
 
00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:13.549 align:start position:0%
that a cigar bar did not become a
full-blown

00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
full-blown
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant uh they put a Prohibition in
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
among other things that you could not
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
serve food and what we've discovered is
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
serving food is interpreted to mean even
 
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:27.799 align:start position:0%
as representative Tusk said uh offering
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
snacks on on the bar um the traditional
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
bar snacks so what we propos to do um as
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
a Senate Bill last year did and
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately got hung up in the
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
suspension of the legislature is uh
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
change one word from service to sale so
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
now the prohibition would be on the sale
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
of food we could serve food which means
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
the cigar bar is allowed to provide a
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
snack on the bar it's really that simple
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
um there was no opposition last year uh
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm not aware of any POS opposition
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
this year um and just for background I'm
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
aware uh Mr chair I think there are
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
about a dozen and a half Cigar Bar
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state currently uh
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
roughly a third of them I think are
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
members of our association and we
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
represent about 13 locations among uh
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
five owners uh of the uh cigar shops
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
some of them have a cigar B light in
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
them and some do not uh it's really
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
folks that that simple I'm happy to
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
answer questions to the best of my
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
ability um but also Mr chair um
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
participating in the the committee
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
meeting is Kurt Kendall one of the the
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
license owners he's got uh twins smoke
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
shop down in London Dairy so any
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions that I'm unable to answer um
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
he may be able to as well okay well I
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
would just yeah let Kurt know to raise
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
your hand if you would like to speak at
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
some point I think we're pretty
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward here here I only have
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
one other person thank you Curtis any
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members for
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
Curtis uh we do uh represent
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
mcer uh yes uh Mr bar what is a snack I
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
mean a snack could be anything from a
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
pretzel to a hamburger a slider sure um
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know it that subject has come up in
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
the past and I appreciate the question
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
um if we go down the road of trying to
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
Define what they're going to provide uh
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
it gets to be awfully difficult the
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
where you draw a line I would suggest
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
that if they're not selling a product
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
right they're not making any money
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
they're providing it free they're really
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
not going to offer something terribly
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
substantial it's a our philosophy is we
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
want to provide something for the
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
stomachs of folks that are um partaking
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
in adult beverages it's it's really that
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
ham

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
ham
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman um I'm I
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
just wondered I thought that in order to
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
serve alcoholic beverages um you needed
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
to um serve food and so I'm just curious
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
how how the cigar bar can be serving
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverages without serving a
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
meal or substantial food right well
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
those licenses are the different license
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
types within the Li statutes this
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
license type which uh is in the statute
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
that I sent around 178
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
20a uh creates a license type that does
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
not require food sale uh it does require
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
that uh if you look at it it's 2A in
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
that statute uh that the location
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
generates 60% of or more of its
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
quarterly gross revenue from the sale of
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
cigar related products so it's it's
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
similar in that it requires a threshold
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
they can't just be
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol and oh by the way sell a cigar
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
here or there um the primary purpose of
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
the business must be the sale of cigars
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
at retail um but then they're allowed
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
this particular license type which if I
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
recall correctly was around 2009 put
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
into statute um allows for the sale of
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol in a bar setting regulated with
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
these Provisions um which include that
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
the sale of the retail product 60% or
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
more um does not allow cigarette smoking
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
and some of the other Provisions that
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
you see in the
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
statute thank you all set thank you for
 
00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
statute thank you all set thank you for
the

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
question yes we'll be talking about that
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
food requirement again and other
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
bills okay any other questions
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%

licensing uh costs and so forth um that
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing that would make
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
someone want to shift to a different
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
license because now they could serve

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
testify that quite often that there is
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
always an un unintended consequence to
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of these bills um that are
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
coming in that have that are actually
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
touching some of our
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
rsas um and and with this one I do not
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
see anything unintended at the same time
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
this is a a license type that at some
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
point we probably have to look at
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
because we're we're seeing a lot of uh
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
hookah bars um that are popping or
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
trying to pop up uh utilizing this
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
license type and it's being used
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
improperly so um probably a conversation
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
for a different time but uh uh in full
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
disclosure no this would not I don't see
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
any unintended
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
consequences but great question thank
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
my question um what is the cost for a
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
license like this for an owner of a
 
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.109 align:start position:0%
license like this for an owner of a
cigar

00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
bar I will get that information for and
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
and the only reason I say that is the
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
license fees have been um spoken about
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
quite often and I don't want to confuse
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
this license type fee with a fee that
 
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.829 align:start position:0%
this license type fee with a fee that
were

00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
proposing um that that's coming down the
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
road so um it I probably need about five
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
minutes to walk down the hallway here
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
and just make verify that I give you the
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
right number I just don't want yeah it's
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's not important but a followup Mr
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
chair there a question in uh cigar bars
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
do they just sell cigars yes that's it
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
and cigar products tobacco
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
products cigarettes so no cigarettes
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
cigars only
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
all right um and uh one more question
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
the snack thank you uh the snacks um are
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
they packaged because I mean I mean this
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
is covid times but I'm not sure if you
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
regulate if they're packaged or not um
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
the food requirement would just be that
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
there's uh food according to the statute
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the ratios of are and you're
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
going to hear as uh the chairman said
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh food being brought up quite often
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
today um in this the regulatory uh body
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
over that would be
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
HHS um it wouldn't be us just because it
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
has to do with food all we care about is
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
abenson thank you Mr Mr chair and thank
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm looking
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
at or last night I was looking at this
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill and House Bill
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
337 um it looks like they affect the
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
same line of text in the RSA I wonder if
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
passage of both of them could create a
 
00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:12.309 align:start position:0%
passage of both of them could create a
conflict

00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you you can't you can't pass
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
both you have to choose one of the other
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
and then amend uh amend one of the bills
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
gims uh
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
what the public policy of this what the
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee decides whether they think
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that food be sold at a
 
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.950 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that food be sold at a
cigar

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
bar or vice
 
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.190 align:start position:0%
bar or vice
versa

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
versa
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%

panelists of course we're a little early
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
now we are early so I'm not going to
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
technically open but I'm just just
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
trying to along here as my technician
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
Tech job here as I'm just trying to move
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
things along um and pull up people um
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so we don't have that lag
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid that
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
lag well you're so efficient you get
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
way I ask Pam a question while we have a
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
moment yes uh Pam could you send us the
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
blue sheets from last
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
week um didn't I send them last week I
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
record um let me see if I still have
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
them I might
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
have well I I would have them so I I'll
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
if you don't have them I can I can send
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
it to them I don't think any of the
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
committee members got
 
00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:54.030 align:start position:0%
committee members got
it

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
NOP okay I can read generate them I I
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
wipe them out because you know they're
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
not the final sheets you know what I
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
sent to you there's no reason to really
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
for me to keep them other than if you
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
ask for them later um so I can recreate
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
yourself yeah so the uh the question is
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
going back to that first bill the
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
definition of liquor
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um and that and then the
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
Senate decid to narrow it down can that
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
language it it seemed really narrow
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
right so it sound like like you were
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
intentionally making sure s sagra or or
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
other larger uh distillers could not
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
participate in sampling at Farmers
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
about I guess he's still having trouble
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.390 align:start position:0%
 
mark

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:02.589 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:54:24.069 align:start position:0%
 
Aiden

00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:54.069 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:37.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay so Aiden is having ongoing uh
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh so he Mark is Gonna Fill
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
In If he if he fails again right now
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
he's gonna log out and then come back in
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
again so that we can hopefully we can
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
start this right
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
chairman can you hear me now I can hear
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
you you're good Miracle of Technology
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
Marvel so we'll see see what happens
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:33.390 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
so uh for the rest of the committee
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
members what he and I were discussing U
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
just so everybody understand U and that
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
is that my answer about uh being a um
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer is the correct
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
answer but that when the question I you
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
probably might have heard me ask was
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
related to sazak a larger let's say very
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
large Distillery um and they're really
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
the only one we have here in New
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a large Distillery that we
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
did narrow it um so that they would not
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
participate um sazak is sort of um in
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
this in our business is sort of
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
controversial in the sense that um they
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
are a third fourth category um which but
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
also they are a liquor manufacturer but
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
they are what we um call a
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
rectifier uh and I'm not sure everybody
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
in the committee knows what a rectifier
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
is but rectifier is someone who
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
Blends so uh they s could be bringing um
 
00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
Canadian whiskey down and mixing in
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
cinnamon and uh um jalapeno I don't know
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think it's cinnamon is what they mix
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
in and and make a that hot hot whatever
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh whiskey that's very popular so that
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's a rectifier we do have another
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
rectifier in
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
Salem who uh takes uh who makes lemon
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
cello uh but I don't know how big they
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
are and whether that this minum U What
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in terms of what is to allow
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
them to participate or not but that's
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
another story of course but I just want
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure everybody um understands uh
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we are narrowing it down to being
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
just AA a small distillery in the state
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
um all right it's 10 o'clock uh we'll
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on uh house
 
00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:25.789 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on uh house

bill

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
esteem members of the committee my name
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
is representative Cody Banger um I am
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives from eping
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and today I come before
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
you in support of HB
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
337 um what this Bill does is strike out
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
specific language in the bill excuse me
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the current
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
RSA and uh if you have the bill in front
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
of you it strikes out or service of food
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason why um I frequent um
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
frequently smoke um cigars
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
myself um hearing from consumers um and
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
being a consumer
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
myself um
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
while while we enjoy a nice smoke and
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
we'll enjoy a beverage while we're there
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that we're not allowed
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
to do is buy or even be served food um
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
this doesn't stop you from bringing food
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
in um but sometimes uh for example at
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
some some locations they're open late
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
you might not be around um a shop so uh
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me a a food um entity um so this
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill fixes that and what and and allows
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
that to change obviously the argument is
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know you shouldn't have food and
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
near smoke you know it's unhealthy you
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
know whatever um and that is obviously
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to be an argument that you have
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
either heard from the previous bill
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
which I'm also a co-sponsor of um and um
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps an argument that you may hear
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
over this bill um but it is but what it
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
does is subject the
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
consumer to purchase the product whether
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
that be a cigar and say chips and salsa
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
or mozzarella sticks or something to
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
that effect should they choose um the
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
number one thing that I want to point
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
out and again this may be an argument
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
that be made is that this does not turn
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
a cigar bar into a restaurant um just
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
putting that out there you are still
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
required to sell 60% of your sales with
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
cigar supplies whether that these cigars
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
themselves whether that be um again
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
cigar supplies humidor over the packs
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
lighters Etc which is already outlined
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the RSA um this just allows um cigar
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
bars uh if should they choose to do this
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
obviously they don't have to if they
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell or provide right
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
because the the previous bill doesn't
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
exactly say that they have to uh excuse
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
me they they wouldn't be able to sell um
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
this allows both to happen should the
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
establishment choose to do so um and
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
with that I will be more than happy to
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh we do uh
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative Fargo has a question yes
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um representative
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
Bellinger the the analysis says that um
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
the bill allows scy bars to serve food
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
and qualify for a leor license but when
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
I read the bill itself I I don't see
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill that would allow
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
for the qualification of a liquor
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
license all it really does is remove or
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
um the restriction on the surface of
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
food yeah you have to read the whole the
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
whole bill I mean the whole statute this
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
is just one line in the statute that
 
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
is just one line in the statute that
we're

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
amending representative uh Fargo if I
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%

Banger not Bellinger um um thank you um
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
so yes as the chairman stated um cigar
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
bars are most of them I should say um I
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to generalize them already
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
are allowed to obtain a liquor license
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
so like like you pointed out yes all it
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
does is strike the um service of food
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
line they're already allowed to um
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
obtain a liquor license you know for
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
example one cigar bar in Portsmith uh
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
they sell cigars as well as are able to
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
liquor for the question oh that answer
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
hton thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative Banger uh just want to
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
clarify this second Bill allows both
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
sale and service
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
correct uh yes ma'am so M while the
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
first bill essentially says that they
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
may service food um my bill would allow
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
both say I decide I want to open up a
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
cigar bar I choose to um maybe not
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
charge my consumer for chips and salsa
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
mozzarella sticks whatever appetizer
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
type esque or even um to go beyond that
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
a burger um if I choose to provide that
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
service instead of charging my consumer
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
I can do that or I can charge my
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
consumer should I choose and again I'm
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
still required to sell 60% of my sales
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
of cigar products that
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
change brother question me that answers
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
your question thank you yes it does uh
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
is it your intent that restaurant style
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
food can be prepared and sold in cigar
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
bars you mentioned Burgers uh fries um
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
maybe steaks later
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:27.630 align:start position:0%
maybe steaks later
on

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
I mean I wouldn't foresee a stake being
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
sold at a cigar bar but again this
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't turn it into a restaurant it
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
allows for the service Andor sale of
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
food in a cigar bar what capacity of
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
that is subject to the um the
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
establishment and should the consumer
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
choose to pay for and or order that is
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
up to them but again requires that
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
establishment to have 60% of sales stay
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
as cigar um
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
sales thank
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
you it'll be a cheap stake uh
 
01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative burz yes thank you yes it
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
probably would thanks for taking my
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
question um I guess I'm I'm confused I
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand the 60% rule about the cigars
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be creeping towards
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
being a restaurant so I'm wondering if
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
all the rules and regulations and
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
licenses that apply to restaurants such
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
as Safe Serve Etc would apply to the the
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
food you're you're free to answer
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative sorry
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um yeah so I
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
mean no not really again you are
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
required to sell 60% of your sales via
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
cigars so this doesn't change you from
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
being a cigar establishment into a
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant it should be based on the
 
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.670 align:start position:0%
restaurant it should be based on the
consumer

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
whether they should choose to go to this
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
him whoops I guess you have to log back
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
in uh so you're you'll have to wait with
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
your question Joyce and hopeing he'll
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
come back in
 
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.309 align:start position:0%
come back in
soon

01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh Max I put your hand down because you
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
are a co-sponsor you cannot ask a
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
question can I challenge the can I
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
God no I'm serious about this this came
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
up uh last session in Municipal and
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
County and the resolution was that if
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't testify that you should all
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to ask questions no
 
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.910 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to ask questions no
the

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
the the other representative Belanger
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
Jim Belanger right before he retired
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
suggested that we remove that rule so he
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I work together with a house clerk
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
the house clerk emailed me back and said
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
there isn't a rule on co-sponsors asking
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions that that's just been a custom
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
and um it's it's left up to the the uh
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
the house if the house wants to add that
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
rule in we just haven't been doing it
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
but I have an actual open-end question
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
question uh okay well uh well I'll come
 
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
back to you but let's right now uh Joyce
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
has a question for representative Banger
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead Joyce yes thank you um I don't
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
think that Anita's question was really
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
answered and that is whether or not all
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
of the rules about um restaurants would
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
apply in this situation I mean we have
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
to have real standards for preparing
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
food and the other question is I'm
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
wondering how this let's just stop with
 
01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
that so you would like him to pursue
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that question some more represent
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
lancher can you speak to that question
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
yes I do apologize I got bounced and it
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
must be a bad uh bad service um
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
so certain establishments are required
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
food establishments are required to set
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
to a certain standard right so obviously
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
if you are preparing food you are also
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
required to adhere to those standards
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
and again going back this does not turn
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
a cigar bar into a restaurant it just
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
allows them to service and or sell food
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
should the consumer choose to purchase
 
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
should the consumer choose to purchase
said

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
said
food

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
followup further question you may
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
inquire uh thank you um I'm wondering
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
about enforcement of this um how often
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
would how do you maintain that 60
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
40% uh balance and and who is going to
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
be making sure that that remains that
 
01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:58.229 align:start position:0%
be making sure that that remains that
balance

01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
remains is my question understood I'm
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
wondering how is this
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
enforced the same way it's already
 
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.270 align:start position:0%
enforced the same way it's already
enforced

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
now via liquor and law
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I I believe that's the I
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
believe that's the enforcement I I
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't fully know the answer
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
to that theoretically The Liquor
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
Commission uh can audit a u a cigar bar
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
and ensured that there sales just like
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
we actually had the food requirement for
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants that there Del liqu
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
commission audit does
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
audits so any other questions
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative won no thank
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
you okay representative aberson do you
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
blanger yes it's an actual question okay
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
so we have about a dozen shops On the
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
Border in my district that uh sell
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
cigars and tobacco related products do
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh off the top of your head how
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
many different cigar shops there are
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
under this license throughout the state
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
generating so I mean I frequent a a
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
variety of them right so um there are
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
quite a few On the Border some in
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
Londoner Manchester seab Brook and
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um to what end I don't
 
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what their revenues are um
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
but that'd be a good question uh excuse
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
me a good point to bring up um that I
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
could email the committee all right
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
much okay um so any other questions from
 
01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:42.910 align:start position:0%
much okay um so any other questions from
Mr

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
blanger see done thank you very much um
 
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't have any other people signed
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
up to speak on this bill uh Aiden do you
 
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
do you mind just uh offering up what you
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
can tell us about the liquor
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
commission's enforcement of right now of
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
the cigar bars thank you Mr chairman can
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay now yes okay thank you
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
um I think this this bill uh presents
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
some interesting challenges for the
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
commission as far as how it would uh
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
apply it if the and I'm kind of walking
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
through this if the the legislature
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
carved out cigar bars with 17820 a as a
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
creature that
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
um has the ability to sell alcohol and
 
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.310 align:start position:0%
um has the ability to sell alcohol and
is

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
licensed but because of probably the
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
indoor smoking act and a few other
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
things have said has said you really
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
can't serve food and that's what section
 
01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.270 align:start position:0%
can't serve food and that's what section
2D

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
2D
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
addresses if you were to allow the
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
business to sell food now
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
I believe we would probably interpret
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
that as now this becomes a
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant and would be required to
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
adhere to the health standards that are
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
exist uh at the state level and that the
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
facility would need to uh show that its
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
ability to they they wouldn't
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily demonstrate it to us but
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
they would probably demonstrated it to
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health or the local
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
health inspection office that their food
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
preparing facilities meet Health
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
standards so um it could very well
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
change the
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
category um and would would kind of
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
create a bit of a dilemma for us because
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
Cigar Bar license itself
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't of course as it was created
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
does not have food but if you're going
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
to now say you can prepare food uh we
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
would probably uh take an opinion that
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
this now we may force them or or require
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
them to get a restaurant license of some
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
type and I'm not sure we have an
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
adequate license type that would allow a
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant to have smoking indoors and
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
it may very well be in violation of the
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
indoor smoking act so there are there
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
are a number of issues I see um that
 
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.390 align:start position:0%
are a number of issues I see um that
could

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
emerge uh based upon the passage of this
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
if it were going to be preparation and
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
service of food unlike uh the last bill
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
which allowed for you know the business
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
to merely put uh food on the bar or
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
wherever they place it like nuts or
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
pretzels or whatever um that's that's a
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a different creature but when you
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
talk about preparing the food um that
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
completely so um in terms of auditing uh
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know how often you
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
guys audit cigar bars or um and kind of
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
light on staff would uh would we'd have
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
to revisit the um license fee because of
 
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.350 align:start position:0%
to revisit the um license fee because of
increased

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
auditing uh well the fee the chief
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned in in the last hearing that
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
the fee for this license was
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
$840 and the reason it it is $840 that
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
it is that is it is specifically not
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:23.709 align:start position:0%
it is that is it is specifically not
considered

01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
a restaurant if you look at the rest of
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing category in 17820 you'll
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
find that lenes that sell spirits and
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they're allowed to
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
do um have a cocktail lounge license
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
$1,200 but because of the fact that this
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
particular business can't sell
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
food then the decision was made that
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
they should be charged the same fee as a
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as a service bar
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
license so they uh that's where we get
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
the $840 as opposed to
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
$1,200 so if you were to um we we would
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
we look at the maintenance of these
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
figures um you know compliance because
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
it certainly if a business
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh chooses to say well you know I really
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
I got this license it was pretty easy to
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
get and I'm certainly not making any
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
accusations about any business but that
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
um they could fall out of compliance
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly if they are not attentive
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the tobacco side of their business
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
and spend most of their time on the
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
sales of alcohol so it is an area that
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
we frequently look at to ensure
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
compliance and I think the chief made a
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
reference to the fact that there's a uh
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
frequent uh challenges amongst the
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
existing lenses sometimes to keep them
 
01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:56.310 align:start position:0%
existing lenses sometimes to keep them
in

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
compliance okay uh now we have more
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions if you're willing to take them
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
wondered and it may not um necessarily
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
relate to serving food or not but what
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
are the air quality standards for cigar
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
bars you know as opposed to a restaurant
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
or other type
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
establishments what what are those
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
standards that might differ from a
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant um thank you for your
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
question representative I I uh I I I
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
won't waste time I don't know the answer
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
to that so uh I
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
apologize well I I can answer that since
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who wrote the original
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
indoor smoking act um on the Commerce
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
Committee I was the uh subcommittee
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
chairman of that bill that was related
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
to when we still allow restaurants to
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
have smoking but once we ban smoking in
 
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants that section for restaurants
 
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.430 align:start position:0%
restaurants that section for restaurants
was

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
mute but the indoor smoking act still
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
talks about being effectively segregated
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
in designated smoking areas and that
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff but again that's only for
 
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.030 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff but again that's only for
non-

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
non-
 
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.950 align:start position:0%
non-

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
businesses representative Herbert you

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:17.790 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman hunt

[Music]
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
um do we have any establishments left in
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
the state uh private places that serve
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
food maybe and smoking as well at the
 
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.830 align:start position:0%
food maybe and smoking as well at the
same

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
time um I believe the only um facilities
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
that allow that are are social clubs
 
01:18:36.639 --> 01:18:37.629 align:start position:0%
that allow that are are social clubs
veterans

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
clubs um where um I think the public
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
policy has been made that uh veterans
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
should be uh allowed to have a place
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
where they can uh gather and have
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol in smoke if they wish so that's
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
my only the only place I'm aware of that
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
would possibly allow
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
that further question yes forther
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
question may inquire um thank you
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's just it intrigues me uh
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
because u i mean in so another words a
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
Legion Post could uh put in
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
a cigar uh
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh do business there and
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
still serve food and it would be it's a
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
private club and uh that would be legal
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
under the law so as we sit here
 
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
today well a a military veterans Club
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
holds a license a club license under
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
17820 and um has been carved out of the
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
exception or exception has been created
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
for them in smoking it's not um I think
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
the public policy was this is a a group
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
that should be uh not necessarily swept
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
into the prohib prohibitions that exist
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh for restaurants um and I I would
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
where chairman hunt has authored the
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
indoor smoking act I would defer to him
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
for any greater detail on that
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
area right well the I think you're right
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
about there was also I think it was
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs so I guess what would be
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
the interesting question is to find out
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
is um how many uh uh social clubs are
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
out there that and you know not
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
withstanding whether they're V I think
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
they were all pretty much VFW you know
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
then um veterans but you know is there
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
is there another social club that has
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
been able to get a license um and I
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
guess because you could make the
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
arguments that smoking a cig is kind of
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
antisocial Behavior so if they're
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing that together that maybe
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
they should have a Social Club of their
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
own so it would be interesting to uh
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
find out if um if there's anything other
 
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:05.950 align:start position:0%
find out if um if there's anything other
than

01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
veterans but I would say that when it
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
came to the indoor smoking act the the
 
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs of veterans were
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally removed um from the bill
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
and then when later on when an attempt
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ban them from having smoking came up
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh well let's put it nicely the
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and his wisdom felt that
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
that that those bills were they did not
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
want to pass them at that time you know
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
enforce that
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
regulation okay uh let's see uh
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Emon has a
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chair and
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
guess I'm speaking to Mr Moore yes you
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
are yes
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
your uh so my my first uh part is a
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
um on F Street in Washington
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
DC there is a restaurant that allows you
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
to smoke cigars it's name is uh Shell's
 
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
to smoke cigars it's name is uh Shell's
back

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
room and you can eat dinner in
 
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.709 align:start position:0%
room and you can eat dinner in
Washington

01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
DC and you can order things like chicken
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
wings Burgers Pizza fries egg rolls
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
salads a very long menu of food uh I've
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
eaten there and I've smoked while I
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
while I ate so not far from the US
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
capital um I guess my question is is it
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
just because this business model doesn't
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
fit the current
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and that's why that business
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
model is not legal and how does
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
Washington DC uh do it and New Hampshire
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
can't okay well I'll I'll take this
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Aiden um when the prohibition ended the
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
21st amendment it didn't say okay
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
anybody you know there's no more
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition you know anybody's freefor
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
all it actually said uh more to the St
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
that each
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
state uh can then design and decide what
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to legalize so theoretically
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
a state could have stayed dry um no
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
State chose to do that DC is obviously a
 
01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
whole another animal because it's you
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
know it's in limbo there but so I can't
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
speak to the regulations and how you
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that obviously would be whatever
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
that DC Council they can do whatever
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
they want but it is true that the way
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
everything we've done in New Hampshire
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
here everything is is done our way um
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
not withstanding that we're one of the
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
19 controlled states where other states
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
Didn't Do It um and so
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
we and I agree it is very Byzantine the
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
way we do everything here and way what
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
we choose and what we choose didn't
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
choose you know why we have uh you know
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have we're protecting the three- tier
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
system but yet we um allow Brew PBS so
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
each one uh is a little chipping away at
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
whatever we thought was the the doctrine
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to manifest but at
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um this is what we
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
have and and and I can't say you say why
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
can you do it well it's because the
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislature has determined that that's
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
what they want to do so just a quick
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
followup yes for the question inquire um
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so leaving out liquor uh cigars and food
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
right that's the other two components uh
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there a business model for cigars and
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
food without serving liquor the the
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
doctrine was I mean the doctrine was
 
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.629 align:start position:0%
doctrine was I mean the doctrine was
that

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh cigar bars were kind of a new
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
phenomena that they were really just
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
just popped up in the more recent years
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and they for years were operating and
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
then they came in and said can we serve
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
liquor and the do and the policy at the
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
time and has and pretty much carried on
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
to this was well um no we don't want you
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
to you know we you know we we'll give
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
you liquor but you certainly don't want
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
to trample on the lights of restaurants
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
because all the restaurants are barred
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
from smoking or barred from having
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
cigars so you know how we're going to
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's not fair uh and certainly
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
you're putting towns in an awkward
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
position because um they were they each
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
town has the right to say no to whatever
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
regulations the liquor regulations we
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
come up with so we're kind of changing
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
the model because we said to them
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
originally that we would not
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
allow cigar bars to be restaurants at
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that was the original premise so uh
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
we are changing the rules of the game if
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
we were to pass this legislation and in
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
each City in town might have the right
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
to come back and say well gee we want to
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%

me uh this is Drew Klein I'm president
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
of the jiia Bartlett Center for Public
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
Policy um not testifying in favor or
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
against just a neutral comment on this
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um so what I noticed in the
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion in the committee was that
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
all the discussion was focused on cigar
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
bars preparing their own F food and
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
serving food as if they were a
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant so preparing hot food having
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
a kitchen but I I think it's worth
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
pointing out that the way the rules work
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
now cigar bars are not allowed to serve
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
or sell food which means they are stuck
 
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.669 align:start position:0%
or sell food which means they are stuck
putting

01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
putting
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
um free snacks on the countertop so that
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
would mean essentially nuts and uh
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
cocktail nuts and pretzels basically
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
they actually can't right now on the
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
current law they're not allowed to
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
provide food what is
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
actually snacks I'm not allowed to
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
provide snacks I I'm sorry Mr chairman
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
um I I understand that in the law um if
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
you frequent cigar bars you will notice
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
that that still happens sometimes so
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's my shock shocked shocked
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
so um so my and my yeah so thank you for
 
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:56.790 align:start position:0%
so um so my and my yeah so thank you for
the

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
clarification um so my point is um
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
what'll what'll sometimes happen is that
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
um free food will be offered that isn't
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
provided prepared uh at a cigar bar so
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
because the customers you if you're
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
sitting there smoking especially if
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
you're drinking you do want to have some
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
snack food so um so the previous bill
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
would allow you to serve um right snacks
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
so what I wanted to point out was the
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
difference between serving and selling
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
so under the previous bill you could
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
legally put the snack food out but
 
01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.550 align:start position:0%
legally put the snack food out but
you're

01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
still required to basically give it away
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
for free so under this bill um what you
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
would allow is not simply um I in other
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
words I don't think you should presume
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
that a cigar bar is in interested in
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
becoming a restaurant and preparing hot
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
food if cigar bars are allowed to sell
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
food that could also include and would
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
most likely primarily include packaged
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
prepackaged and food that is made
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
outside the facility so right now if a a
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
patron of a cigar bar wants to buy a
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
Snickers bar um or a muffin or a bagel
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
or a slice of pizza um that is prepared
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
off site that's not allowed so if you
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
allow the sale of food
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that you
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
could allow um bars to sell uh slim gems
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
and beef jerky and other packaged items
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
that would be in demand when you're
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
sitting there drinking but that they
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited from selling um
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
under the first bill so um just just
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
something to point out that that the
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
language in the bill um might be able to
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
be worded in such a way um if the
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
members of committee were were extremely
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to allowing ing on premises
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
preparation of hot food to still allow
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
the actual retail sale of some types of
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
food so that that is all just wanted to
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
point out that distinction okay so um as
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's been around for all this
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislation um uh the leg uh we're we'll
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
pretend that we didn't hear you say that
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
they are providing snacks and we'll uh
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
go with what we thought we passed and
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
what we've always said is could be true
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that that if you're going to Cigar
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
Bar you could bring your own snack you
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
could bring I've heard stories of having
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
a pizza being delivered to a cigar bar
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know from a pizza delivery company
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
so um I I had I hear what you're saying
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
which is that maybe we should uh retain
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and somehow figure out some
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
way to uh look at what is currently
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
going on in some of these facilities and
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that we uh uh that that the
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
La is being abided and that we have
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
passed a law that is that is
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
enforcable well right I mean my comment
 
01:31:00.910 --> 01:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
was just essentially to point out that
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
um you could work a law that would allow
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
the sale of prepared um uh prepackaged
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
or food that is prepared off premises um
 
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
that that would would be an option as
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to assuming that allowing the
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
sale means that they would have a
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen and become a
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant fair enough uh so max you
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
have a question from
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Klein well I'm not sure if this
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
question might be better aimed at you um
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
if the intent of the law was that
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
somebody goes into a cigar bar you don't
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
want them to either either have food
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
delivered or order Uber Eats or maybe
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
you you don't even want legal I'm saying
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
that as far as I know it is perfectly
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
legal to have it delivered or you bring
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
it in with you it just said that that
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
the owner the facility is not permitted
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
to provide food under the current
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
statute so was it your intent that
 
01:31:57.109 --> 01:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
people couldn't order food through the
 
01:31:59.229 --> 01:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
owner or their employee and have it
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
delivered there or you wouldn't have the
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
owner employee physically handle the
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
food and put it in front of you or clean
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
up afterwards our intent was that the
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
owner would not had have anything to do
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
with um you know because our original
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
statant I don't even know if it's still
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
true I have to admit um was that the
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
this the actual cigar smoking room was a
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
bifurcated space uh and and um separate
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and so that no employee would
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
technically have to be allow have to
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
walk into that smoking area um so you
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
know again how do you you know how do
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
you handle serving or picking orders or
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
food whatever if it's in a separate
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
little room so again I think that maybe
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly retain this bill
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
and see to really down drill down to
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
what's actually going on in these spaces
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
and representative hunt if I'm still on
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
yes sir Drew Klein again and I just
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
should clarify I did didn't mean to
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that cigar bars were illegally
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
serving snacks so I I apologize if I
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
spoke um you know not precisely there
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
but people do bring snacks in and you
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
see people sharing their nuts and that
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so not trying to right
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
this time yes thank you that and that's
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's what you actually see and I

colleagues I hope you're enjoying this
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
lovely snowy day here in February um I'm
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
here to testify about House Bill
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
176 um which is a bill to
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
um to allow beer and wine delivery for
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh food establishments that already have
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
a license to sell beer and wine on
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
premises um I do want to just check in
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
and make sure that everyone received the
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that I emailed um yesterday
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh you should check your email
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
if you haven't yet seen it uh basically
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
I updated the text of the bill to match
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
the same bill that's happening in the
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
Senate right now because uh there have
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussions and
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I want to go through it
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're all looking at
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing so um the amendment is
 
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.950 align:start position:0%
the same thing so um the amendment is
2021

01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.750 align:start position:0%
2021
d02

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
d02
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
61h um so we should all be looking at
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
that for for the correct text of the
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
bill um so originally when I had
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
proposed this bill it included mixed
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
drinks if you if you have the version
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
that talks about mixed drinks that's
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
wrong we're not talking about um liquor
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're just talking beer and wine um to
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
be super
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
um so as you probably know um the the
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
industry has certainly suffered quite a
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
bit during the Corona virus we're seeing
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
all kinds of innovative ways for
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant type establishments to figure
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
out how to make money um in the time of
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
Corona virus and so uh something that we
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
have allowed through emergency executive
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
order is for establishments uh to sell
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
beer and wine through delivery um also
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
you should know that from from the
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
history perspective on this bill this
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was being
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
negotiated during
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
2020 before the pandemic hit uh so this
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
um this has been a topic of discussion
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
to try to allow delivery of beer and
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
wine even before Corona virus but I
 
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
think Corona virus has certainly
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the need for a source of
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
revenue for establishments that
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
typically would have people coming to
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
have a meal and serve beer and wine and
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
since they're only doing takeout and
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
delivery they still need a way to sell
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
their inventory and also make that money
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
that they had expected in their business
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
plan um so uh just a quick spin through
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
this bill as proposed um once again no
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
references to um mix drinks if you see
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at the wrong bill um
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
really the purpose of this is to allow a
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant to um have their delivery
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
driver uh in many instances um a
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
W2 uh and they have to be 21 years of
 
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
age uh to deliver both food and the
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
paired wine and beer that go with the
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
food um as part of the delivery there
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
were some concerns about um people
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
ordering to public establishments and to
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
college campuses so you'll see on page
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
two there's all kinds of language
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that those acts you can't
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
deliver to a college campus you can't
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
deliver to a public library public
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
playground or public park you actually
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
have to be going to a private address um
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that someone who's
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
creative couldn't come up with some
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
other establishment that's not listed
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
here but the idea is to make sure that
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
um this really is for private
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
consumption of beer and wine not in the
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
public um so uh the intent is that it
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
would be effective July 1
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
2022 um I suppose we could play with the
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
effective date seeing as there is a
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
sister Bill happening in the Senate as
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
well and and certainly the industry
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
needs it sooner rather than later um but
 
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
nonetheless that really is the concept
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
here is to enable what's already going
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
on through um emergency order to become
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the books because we have learned
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
that some of the emergency orders are
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
really great and perhaps we should make
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
them uh legislation so I'm not by any
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
means an expert on this and there will
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
be people after me who can testy testify
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more on the Nuance to this
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
bill um but I'm happy to take any
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
muted yeah I was printing all this stuff
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
so yes so representative Johnson please

Senate
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
bill is in relation to this
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
one uh the Senate bill is 66 the
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
language matches exactly this
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you sure thing uh
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcle um thank you Mr
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh currently if I'm in a
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant and I order a bottle of wine
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
and it's uh I drink half of it I can
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
take the other half home if it's
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
properly sealed I can also go to a uh
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
a brew pub and get a a Grog of uh of
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
beer and that they seal and Etc so in in
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill I just quickly I
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
just printed it out quickly reading
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
through it um is it possible that that
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would say that you have to
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
order a
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
unsealed bottle of wine or
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
a excuse me a sealed bottle of wine or
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
sealed beer in other words you couldn't
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
get necessarily A Grog delivered but you
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
could get a six pack or you couldn't get
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
a a kff of wine that was poured at the
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
bar but you could buy a bottle of wine
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
is there any distinction
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
there oh that's an excellent question um
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
I too am looking at the language of the
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill for an answer to that question and
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
I don't see something about seiling or
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
partially open in the bill um so that
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
does bring up an interesting question if
 
01:41:23.070 --> 01:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a partial I can I I
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
can answer this question okay so and
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
obviously Aiden will speak but uh it'll
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
help um I'm going to premise this so it
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
helps everybody visualize what's
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
happening here and that is uh the Liquor
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
Commission does not want anything that's
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
partially made or open or Avail
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
potentially could be taint you know
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
tainted with somebody you know doing
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
something to it so if they're going to
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
deliver wine they're going to deliver it
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
in a sealed
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
bottle and I also let you know represent
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
mcams believe it or not there could be
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
liquor uh uh involved in this
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
transaction uh because uh the way the
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill is written it says Beverages and uh
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have expanded beverages to include
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
distilled um alcohol um but they are
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
they're limited to eight% so you can oh
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
what's he saying why is he doing this
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Aiden did I did
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
I you're muted Aiden so I just want to
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody knows that that what
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
is distributed what is what is sold has
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be in a sealed container uh and again
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
by the manufacturer and not from the
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
facility but U I'll give you a chance
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
Aiden to correct me once you're once you
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
get on okay so go ahead uh you have
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
another question I guess we what else it
 
01:42:43.159 --> 01:42:45.109 align:start position:0%
another question I guess we what else it
representative

01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
Herbert thank you chairman hunt
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh I think I think I'm talking to
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
Aiden I suppose I don't know but you
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
want wait to wait to ask him when he
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
gets on you can but right now you're
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
questioning representative M mams well I
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
can I'm not the expert you don't want to
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
ask me expert
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'll wait okay okay great
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
gon H good morning representative
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
Williams and thank you for taking our
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
questions this morning uh my question
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
has to do with holding the restaurant
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
the bartender the waiter the delivery
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
driver harmless uh if the uh if the the
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
person the customer that's receiving the
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
product should then go about and get in
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
their vehicle and and drive and get a DI
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
get a DUI or kill somebody or something
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
like that whereas when alcohol is
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
consumed on premise there's the control
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
and I know you have the language in the
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill with the maximum amount of that can
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
be sold but there's uh there's can
 
01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's no language in the bill dealing
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
with holding the EST establishment
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
harmless and would this be something you
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
might consider or do you need to
 
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.070 align:start position:0%
might consider or do you need to
consider

01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
this I think that that question is best
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
for for Aiden Moore okay well then I
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
will defer to Aiden Moore great thank
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
Aon all right thank you and thank you
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm reading in
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
the uh amended bill that uh that you
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
sent us that you'd have no deliveries at
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
all to any college or university um were
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
you aware that the median age at some of
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
our community colleges is is 26 and that
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
we have some uh we have some
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
colleges um and some programs that are
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
aimed at uh continuing education where
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
you probably couldn't find anyone on the
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
21 um I I am aware of that um and thank
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
you so much for your question I just
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that this is a
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
negotiated compromise with the language
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
um so clearly you can see that there's
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
some concern about overindulging or uh
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps immature drinking behavior and
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
that was sort of the intention to make
 
01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you very much okay
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%

same time so uh my comments sure you
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%

um thank you uh for allowing me to
 
01:46:18.270 --> 01:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
approach this as as uh representative MC
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
Williams indicated um
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Amendment which we just saw is
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what the Senate has been
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
working on in Senate Bill
 
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.709 align:start position:0%
working on in Senate Bill
66

01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
66
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
um what Senate Bill 66 represents is
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
essentially what was being worked on
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
last session and subject to the
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
executive order of the governor for the
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
sale and service of uh alcohol with food
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
um for consumers and uh what we see in
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the amendment which uh again is uh
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
the same as 66 are adequate safeguards
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
which we believe um if followed will
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh these licenses have the
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
ability um to continue this process
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
we've had about a Year's worth of this
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
effort um my conversations with Chief
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
armaganian who's also available is that
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
have been uh no discernable violations
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
of of the executive order uh that would
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
have uh caused us to
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
reconsider this policy and that it seems
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
to have been worked out fairly well um
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
we cannot provide you with details I
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
made a an inquiry to uh the New
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire restaurant and Lodging
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
Association trying to get a sense of how
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
many businesses took advantage of this I
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
I was not able to uh get a an accurate
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
number so I can't tell you with any
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
degree of certainty how many businesses
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
may take advantage of this opportunity
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
in the uh post pandemic world uh but um
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
we we seem to be very satisfied that
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment which is consistent with
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
66 um is uh reasonable and and
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
enforcable and continues the policy that
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
the Governor established through his
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
executive order and I'd be happy to take
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
any questions if any of the committee
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
members would
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
like okay representative Herbert you
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
question thanks again the
 
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm just curious uh my
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
question is I know a lot of states have
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
takeouts uh and you have uh for example
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll you could take out a
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
mix right and uh bring your own tequila
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
I suppose I'm not sure how that works
 
01:48:54.599 --> 01:48:55.790 align:start position:0%
I suppose I'm not sure how that works
but

01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just wondering why what was the
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh objection to mixed
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
drinks uh was it because they were not
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
would be sub maybe not so uh healthy or
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
closed uh properly and that was that it
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
was a health issue or what was the
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
problem with mixed drinks I mean if
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna if you're GNA sell uh wine
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
and beer uh um I don't understand myself
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't do uh mixed drinks as
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
well but uh I saw my question to you is
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
what was the uh what was the concern
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
there well thank you for your question
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative I I believe
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh the I I I believe as representative
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
hunt mentioned the P last session um uh
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
created a new opportunity for re
 
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
retailers both on premise and off-
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
premise as they uh saw the ability to
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
sell uh an expanded uh portfolio of
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
beverages that fit under what a
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
classification called a uh specialty
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
beverage um and so we never really got
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
to the question of um sales of spirits
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
and mixed drinks the uh the consumer
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
does have the ability to order and have
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
delivered uh any of the products that
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
may be considered a you know what what
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
what we refer to is in slang as a Cann
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
cocktail so long as it is within the uh
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
eligible portfolio that the on premise
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
license e can
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
sell um so we've really not got to the
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
question for Spirits I think one of the
 
01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
things that has presented itself in
 
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
other states is the question of sealing
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and preserving the Integrity of
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
these products um because they are mixed
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
at the site and uh so we we never we
 
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
never got to the final bottom line of
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know is this something um that we
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
should support or not support but we did
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
have experiences with uh other states
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
who have had challenges in their
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
application of uh these Provisions that
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
included mixed drinks so I'm not sure if
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
I've responsive to your question sir but
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh we we never got to the bottom line
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
about whether we should add mixed drinks
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
or not I just have one other question uh
 
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
if it's all right chairman hunt other
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
um an executive order of the
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
governor allowed for this this service
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
provided um but
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
the does that mean the governor has the
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh authority to if he changed his mind
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
to add mixed drinks to it without going
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean I think your sense
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know the governor had that
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
kind of executive order
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
Authority well to me but what what I
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
think is important for you to toh be
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
aware of Representative is last year
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that was making its way
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
through the Senate uh when the pandemic
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
hit and um the governor's office was in
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
search of methods to assist this
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
industry and one of the things that we
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
had um in the process of being at least
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
vetted by the legislature was that
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill allowing for uh the uh ship
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
or the sale uh of alcohol with food to
 
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
Consumers and uh so therefore when the
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
governor was looking for a an approach
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
we offered this uh legislation as
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
something that uh he might consider as
 
01:53:04.109 --> 01:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
part of his executive order so um that
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
was reviewed by his staff and I'm sure
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
whatever legal team that he had in place
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um the decision was made to to move
 
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
forward with that uh I can't speak to
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
the uh powers of the governor Beyond
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
that and I think uh you would probably
 
01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
get an opinion from maybe your house
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
counsel about what the powers of the
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
governor are in in an executive order uh
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
framework but uh I'm not sure whether or
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
not he could add it or not but it was
 
01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
not part of the bill that was being
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
entertained last year just one more
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
chairman hun if I might okay so are are
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
the are the restaurants able to do this
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
now or are they waiting for this
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
true um well they've had the ability to
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
do this under the executive order I
 
01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you with any certainty
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not that those orders have
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
expired or not um you may I'm not sure
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
if Mr Mike Summers from the restaurant
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
and Lodging Association is signed up to
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
testify on this or not um but so I I
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
would I would probably let Mr Summers uh
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
feel that question sir if it's okay with
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
me uh representative
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
gson uh yes thank you uh Mr Moore for
 
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
taking our questions my my question was
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
originally uh presented to
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams uh but I was
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
told that you would probably be better
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
able to answer it and so the question is
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
presently uh when alcohol is consumed on
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
premises uh the waiter the bartender the
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
manager can control the amount of
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and be able to refuse service to
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
somebody they they would believe would
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
be uh inebriated and if they were to
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
continue to serve some somebody they
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
could be held responsible after even
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
after that person leaves well here now
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
we have the delivery of alcohol uh off
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
premises uh at what point is the
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant the bartender whatever the
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
delivery driver no longer uh responsible
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
for that other person when can they
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
still be held or are they held harmless
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
once they once they've made the the
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
delivery and should this bill
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
specifically address the issue of being
 
01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:26.350 align:start position:0%
specifically address the issue of being
held

01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
held
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
responsible thank you uh thank you for
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
your question representative I think the
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the issue um that you've
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
described is um one where we have to
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
kind of look at the at the technical
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of the law and that uh the
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
delivery driver who would be a W2
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
employee of the business uh has every
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
right and obligation that this product
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
this alcoholic beverage should not be
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
sold or delivered to a person who's
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
under 21 or to an intoxicated person um
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
on the question of liability I would
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
probably refer you to RSA 507 F which is
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the alcoholic beverage leny liability
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
act and um what you're describing is
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
certainly probably a novel question uh
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
if if a uh if some type of claim were
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
made against a license e under 507 F uh
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
but I think as long as the delivery
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
person uh makes sure that the alcohol is
 
01:56:34.589 --> 01:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
not delivered to a minor or to a person
 
01:56:34.599 --> 01:56:35.390 align:start position:0%
not delivered to a minor or to a person
who's

01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
intoxicated um it is not something that
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
would most likely uh reflect back on the
 
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
action I'm not sure if that is
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
responsive to you or not sir I hope
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
so you all set Jeff uh it it just brings
 
01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
up concerns about putting all that on
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
driver um and I would say that is why um
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
the commission is very strongly in
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
supported the idea that the only the
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
only people who can take uh deliver is
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
the actual restaurant license you know
 
01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
under the restaurant itself and that and
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
and if I if I remember correctly and I
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for over over my bounds
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
here but did did the does the uh the the
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill say that the delivery
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
driver actually has to be 21 or over as
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
well I know the recipient has to be but
 
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
does a delivery driver have to
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
be that's that one's for you Aiden I
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't see that though um yes
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
they have to be at least 21 years of age
 
01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
okay that would be on uh Representatives
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams Amendment on
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
page two uh lines 1 through
 
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.109 align:start position:0%
page two uh lines 1 through
three

01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay right uh paragraph yeah section
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
five I'm afraid I don't have the the
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
amended version so I'm I'm shooting in
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
the dark here on that one okay SE okay
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
Fargo yes thank you Mr chairman um I had
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
a question as I read the amendment um
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it talks about
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
the consumers who are who
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
appear visibly intoxicated or who AR
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable and prudent person would know
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
are intoxicated who do not produce
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
identification or who failed to sign a
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
receipt would not be entitled to his or
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
her delivery well what if they are
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and they do produce
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
identification and they do sign a
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
receipt then
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.830 align:start position:0%
receipt then
what

01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
does the delivery person continue to I
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
mean I I just think the wording in the
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendment leaves an Open Door there that
 
01:59:02.189 --> 01:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
um you could still deliver to someone
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
who's intoxicated am I reading that
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
incorrectly uh thank you for your
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
question representative Fargo I I think
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
the um intent is that the driver I mean
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at the um the
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
delivery driver
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
in the same vein that you would look at
 
01:59:21.679 --> 01:59:22.430 align:start position:0%
in the same vein that you would look at
a

01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
bartender um the bartender would go
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
through the appropriate assessments
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the customers you know
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
looking at their age how old are you
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
their state of intoxication and RSA
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
1795 has a legal obligation that
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the Jesus excuse
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
me that the uh that the uh bartender has
 
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
a legal obligation not to to make the
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
sale uh to persons who are uh either
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
underage or or intoxicated those types
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
of criteria are now extended to the
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
delivery driver who will have to make
 
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
the same assessment I can assure you
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
that with the passage of this law uh the
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
commission has a very
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
vigorous and aggressive alcohol
 
02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
education program and that this would be
 
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
part of any uh
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
program content moving forward that the
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
commission would try to make sure that
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
these businesses understood what the law
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
says and how they should apply it so
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
that it's consistent with the
 
02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:29.589 align:start position:0%
that it's consistent with the
legislative

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
intent uh of uh of chapter chapter 178
 
02:00:35.159 --> 02:00:35.870 align:start position:0%
intent uh of uh of chapter chapter 178
and

02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
179 so I'm not sure if I answer your
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
question representative I hope I have
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
um um further question inquire yes I I I
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
understand your answer I'm just
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if perhaps the amend needs to
 
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
be tightened up to specifically say what
 
02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
you what you should just shared with us
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
because I think right now the way that
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
it reads is is
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
questionable thank
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions for
 
02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.950 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions for
attorney

02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
more okay um um uh representative uh
 
02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
getting in L Lon I'm I I apologize I
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%

02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:21.400 align:start position:0%

up my phone rang I put my hand down okay
 
02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
my question is to uh Mr Mo would in as
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
much as I am a licensed server I went
 
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
through the course I got my my
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
certificate that I'm a licensed server
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
would it would it do well if the bill
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
included the fact that the delivery
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
driver would also have to be a licensed
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
server because we went through all the
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
courses with how to identify all these
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
traits of someone who should not be
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
served uh and that's my question thank
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your question
 
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your question
representative

02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
um the commission does not license um
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
servers um we provide
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
education um and that education for the
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
servers voluntary there is no uh
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that they participate in
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
education I think there are some
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
incentives that would be well served for
 
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
incentives that would be well served for
the

02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
ly um in making sure that if they uh
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
choose to go down this path of taking
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of this type of delivery that
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
they make sure that their employees are
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
educated uh about the law and to take
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the free uh ly education
 
02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.679 align:start position:0%
programs was offered by the commission
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
they may also potentially inquire from
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
their insurance carrier whether or not
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
the participation in uh education
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
programs may very well bring them some
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
type of Premium reduction if they show
 
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
that they have educated their staff uh
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
in a preventative sort of fashion so
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%

02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
beverage um it it it would have been
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
nice to have been able to do so uh it
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
would have made quarantine I think feel
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
a little more uh normal sometimes so uh
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
just that's all I really wanted to say
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
was just uh I encourage uh the committee
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
to to uh you know you know approve it
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
and bring it to the full house so we can
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh pass it on a full house
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.430 align:start position:0%
uh pass it on a full house
level

02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.629 align:start position:0%
level
fair

02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
enough uh any questions for represent L
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
testimony okay
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%

good
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
morning uh thank you for the opportunity
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
to uh talk to you this morning about uh
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
HB 176 for the record my name is Mike
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
Summers I'm the president CEO of the New
 
02:05:16.589 --> 02:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
Association um we are in support of this
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill as uh under the proposed amendment
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
um to give a little history in this
 
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
space um we had started an effort back
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
in late 2019 working with the Liquor
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
Commission uh and Senate of French on
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
bringing forward a bill that would allow
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
for beer and wine delivery um and then
 
02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
of course um the world ended and we had
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the governor was kind
 
02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
enough to uh essentially adopt that U or
 
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
give us that right under an emergency
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
order which has been very helpful for
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
some businesses
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
um so obviously uh we are very
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of this effort to essentially
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
codify on a permanent basis what
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
essentially the effort we had started uh
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
a year ago um to make this permanent and
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I would encourage that uh you
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
know time is a bit of the essence we
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't know when the emergency order will
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
end and obviously the industry would
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
like to retain this right as we continue
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
to fight to survive this pandemic and
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
then recover on the other side of it so
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
we're certainly uh supportive of both uh
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
this this amended version of the bill in
 
02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:19.719 align:start position:0%
the house and and the Senate version
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
66 we do have a little bit of a concern
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the effective date uh notice it was
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
July 1st of uh of
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
2022 uh and as I just stated uh not
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
knowing when the emergency order ends it
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
would be nice if we could move that date
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
up to say uh July 1st of 2021 um and
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully that there is no lapse in this
 
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh the ability for restaurants to
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
participate in this activity so that
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly be very
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
helpful um and then beyond that I have
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
have responses to a number of questions
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
that were asked um I'm not sure if I
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
want to drill into this too much but you
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
know one of the questions that was asked
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
was about um the current right that most
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh folks visiting a restaurant have
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is to uh open and enjoy part of a
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
bottle and then take the remains of that
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
bottle home with you that is a different
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
part of the statute and frankly I think
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
that that right would still be retained
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think this would affect it
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
they're two totally separate issues um
 
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
so that would still be in place and then
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
we would still be be able to do uh the
 
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
the delivery of beer and wine in their
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
unopen containers and I would also say
 
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
that the one thing that um we we haven't
 
02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
really touched on but I think it's very
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
important for you to understand for the
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
industry is is that these beers and
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
wines are also available for takeouts so
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
if I'm picking up a pizza at a local
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
pizza shop I can grab a six-pack of beer
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
or a bottle of wine or whatever they may
 
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
have available again the limitations all
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
in place and uh so that has also been a
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
a very important component of this uh
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
for for these businesses as we've worked
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic
 
02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.470 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic
so

02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I think I would leave it with that
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I would I i' would try to answer any
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions that the the committee may
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
have uh we do have a question
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative abenson has a
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
question Yeah you mentioned the uh the
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
effective date of the bill um would
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
would you be amendable to something like
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
60 days within passage um it's
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that the bill could be
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
retained until next year so
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
um outside possibility but do you think
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
it it would be preferable to just do 60
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
days within the passage of the bill
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
whenever the bill ends up getting passed
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
sure whatever the you know the will of
 
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
the committee is uh I would just
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
encourage you that sooner is better
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
because not knowing when all of this may
 
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
lift I think the one concern we have is
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we would have a lapse in
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to to participate in this
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so um you know 30 days 60 days
 
02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
whatever you may deem uh appropriate um
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
but I but I believe and I don't want to
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the Senate but I
 
02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
believe the Senate is committed to
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
fast-tracking Senate Bill 66 so that is
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the Senate version of of this
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
amendment so uh so I would I would
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage and ask this
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
committee to move quickly because I
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
think we would very much like to see
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
this done in an expeditious manner all
 
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the
 
02:09:10.589 --> 02:09:10.599 align:start position:0%
question uh representative van
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
hton thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
for your testimony Mr Summers did you
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
just say that partial bottles say of
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
wine be deliverable under this bill in
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
your estimation no no um there is a
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
current piece in the statute that allows
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
that if you go and you dine in a
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant not for take out of delivery
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
but if you dine in a restaurant and you
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh you and you're with a you know a
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
guest you may have a glass of wine each
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
you may have a half a bottle left over
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the meal uh under certain
 
02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
conditions it has to be corked it has to
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
be in a bag that's stapled shut um and
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know once you transport in the
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle it has to be Out Of Reach of the
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
driver that kind of thing in under
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances that you can take
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
home the remainder of that bottle of
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
wine it does not apply for the takeout
 
02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
and delivery thank
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
you um Mike you want to talk about
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill the
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
transportation of beverage and wines and
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
what's what's in there that's different
 
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
far so section two says transportation
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
of beverage and
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
wines this a person may transport
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
deliver beverage and wines the state
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
without a license provided such beverage
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
and wines were obtained as authorized by
 
02:10:23.709 --> 02:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
this title and provided such beverage
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
and wines are consumption only and not
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
purposes so I I guess what is your
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
question question Mr chair what would
 
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
you like me to address we're sitting
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
here talking about
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
lenses um such as yourselves delivering
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
it and then I we got this amendment from
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
represent MC Lam and then I had from
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
your from Henry saying this is word for
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
word for what you guys wanted so I
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
thought maybe you can explain to me what
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
the section two is all about well so so
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
In fairness section two and and Aiden
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
may want to step in and correct me but
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
we simply took that language directly
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
from another part of the of the LIC of
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
the statute where it talks about right
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
now as a as a restaurant employee um I
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
may go down to the liquor store purchase
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
product on the license for the
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant and transport it back to the
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
facility or I may go to sell Warehouse
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
in Bow and pick up our weekly delivery
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
and transport it and so the language
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is in that section I believe is
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
word for word what is in uh that other
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
section where it allows for employees to
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
transport uh uh beverages on behalf of
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
establishment okay so I'll ask Aiden
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
this question but representative V hton
 
02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a question from Mr sumers
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
your all set okay uh so Aiden can you
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
tell me what section two is all about
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
here what this is
 
02:11:51.149 --> 02:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
is this allowing employees to pick up
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
wine and bring it back to the to the
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant is that what this is about
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
because it says it's repealed and
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
reenacted so I assume something's going
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
on here are you there
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
Aiden it's probably on the phone how
 
02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.750 --> 02:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
there uh so so so as far as you know
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
even though it says repeal and reenacted
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know there's anything new in
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
there or
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
anything and actually as i r reread it
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I believe that is exactly
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
the language and you know one of the
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
requirements is that the the um the
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
employee of the licensee has to carry a
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
copy of the license in the vehicle at
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
all times where they're transporting
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
beverages so that's going to be
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
reflective um uh on the delivery drivers
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
as well so they would have to have that
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
a copy of the of the facility's license
 
02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
on them again for for uh you know just
 
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
verification purposes but but I am
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
positive that that is a specific
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
language that is in the transportation
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
of uh beverages to the facility we're
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
now talking about Transportation away
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
from the facility but essentially it's
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
language yeah it's just so weird it says
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
repeal and reenact so I'm just trying to
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
figure out what was changed and and and
 
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
that frankly is a piece that uh would
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
have been put in I Believe by
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
um OS I don't I don't believe that was
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
any that uh we would necessarily have
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
asked for right or or the Senate because
 
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment is coming from the Senate
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
right correct yeah okay I'll give them
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
one more time so Aiden or Mark or either
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
online yes not okay and Chris your hands
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
up just because you haven't do you have
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
a new question
 
02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
Chris yes yes I do okay um um when I
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
first uh thought about this I said oh
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'll take out in other words you always
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
see the people coming in then taking out
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be the consumers
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's their meal they're going back home
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
this bill now has like the delivery the
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
Uber guy and and whatnot and so there's
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
this intermediate uh you've opened up
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
this intermediate uh delivery so at that
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
time neither the consumer nor the
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
premise uh has any control over what's
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
going on and that kind of surprised me
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
so I'm are there other states that do
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
this we're gonna be talking about that a
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
little bit on the next bill but I do I
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
believe Mike Will does have very strong
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
opinion about he would like us to let us
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
know about this bill and as related to
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
that subject well so uh just to clarify
 
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
in this language of this bill uh the
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and again I think you just
 
02:14:46.109 --> 02:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
received it so I I appreciate that fact
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the only person person
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
who can deliver on behalf of the ly must
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
be an employee of the ly so an Uber or
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
somebody else cannot be involved in
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
delivery of alcohol they may deliver
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
meals still just like they they may
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
already but they cannot deliver alcohol
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly that was a control that was
 
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
um uh encouraged and pushed for by the
 
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
LI liquor enforcement and we we agre
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
conceded to that because we understood
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
the chain of custody was going to be uh
 
02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
a big part of the discussion should
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
there be a liability question and so uh
 
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that would not
 
02:15:20.189 --> 02:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
be allowed under this the way this is
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
drafted right now a third-party delivery
 
02:15:24.910 --> 02:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh company would not be able to
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
deliver alcohol on behalf of a
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
l right and that's that's really the
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
whole point is that right and and I
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
think Aiden might be back on so he may
 
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
be able answer that question as well
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
right so Aiden are you can you talk I
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
can you hear me sir yes we can oh thank
 
02:15:42.639 --> 02:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
can you hear me sir yes we can oh thank
you

02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
um um I guess the the question is the
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not a third party is eligible
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
to deliver under this amendment is that
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
do I understand that
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
correctly yes and and I would agree with
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Summers that the answer is no um the
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
reason that we are looking for having it
 
02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
as a W2
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
employee um is
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
to provide a direct opportunity for us
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
to take sanctions against the business
 
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
if in fact a violation were to take
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
place that's certainly not our intent to
 
02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
go out to try to violate a business but
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
if uh if they are unable to follow the
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
provisions in the law then we want to
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
have recourse against the l e if that is
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
done incorrectly um without getting too
 
02:16:36.990 --> 02:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
much in the weeds a third-party delivery
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
system creates something that is
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
referred to in the law as an intervening
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
event and the intervening uh event kind
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
of cuts off the
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
process um and we have a question of of
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
title who takes delivery of the product
 
02:16:54.750 --> 02:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
and when do they take delivery of the
 
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
product and a lot of that is U those are
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
issues which we uh find to be uh
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
challenging to get answers to and and
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the easiest approach to this
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and probably the one that I think Mr
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
summes and his members felt comfortable
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
with is that uh confining it to W2
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
employees would provide uh the best
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
recourse for for his industry as well as
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
the Commission in case there were
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
problems would you agree to that Mr
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
Summers that that's
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
fair this is not a
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
conversation oh sorry sir I apologize
 
02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
but he could he can move his head up and
 
02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
down that's perfect so all right so um
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
so now that I have you a and I forward
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
the EMA this amendment to you did you
 
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
get it yes sir I did thank you okay so
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
can you explain what section two is
 
02:17:49.389 --> 02:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do do for
 
02:17:49.399 --> 02:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
trying to do do for
us

02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh you might not have read that far um I
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
um if you could give me a minute to
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
digest it and um I'll I don't know if
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
there are other questions that members
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
might have that well the interesting the
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
reason we got here is because I started
 
02:18:09.309 --> 02:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the effective date of the
 
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill and then I saw section one and
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
section two had two different effective
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
dates and then then I go what is this
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
all about and um it it it um so if you
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
want to think about that anymore all
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
right so are you speaking about lines 6
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
through 11 so I you know again I know
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
what what I'm looking at is if you were
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
to this is really page
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
three of the amendment to House Bill
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
176 it's page three okay and it starts
 
02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
on page two but it says repeal and
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
wine

02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
wine
 
02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh I I I would say I I I I it would be a
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
mistake for me to just offer something
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so uh Pam I I know I don't know you're
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
you're tracking us and you probably
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
heard me ask this question have did you
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
have you got any insight on what's
 
02:19:11.549 --> 02:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
happening there in that
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
section I'm sorry I'm I'm here but I am
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
working on other things so I wasn't okay
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine no problem
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
all right well um I don't know I guess
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to get more detail on
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
figure out what's happening there so
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
we'll stay tuned on that one it's just
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
frustrating that we don't have
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so we can't really deal
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
with it but at this point um I guess we
 
02:19:36.669 --> 02:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
we'll see a senate version come over so
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
by that time we'll know whatever
 
02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
whatever's in the Senate bill so okay uh
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have any questions for
 
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
Aiden we all set okay
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the attendees anybody attending
 
02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to speak speak now
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
forever more hold your
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%

02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
there she is delay see see this see this
 
02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
is the delay that's why I'm trying to
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
promote people prematurely yeah go ahead
 
02:20:30.429 --> 02:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
Kate Hi hi representative I knew you
 
02:20:33.550 --> 02:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't forget about me um good good
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee um my
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
name is Kate fryan the vice president of
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
advocacy at new futures um we are
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to houseb 176 I did send you all
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier today I will say it
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
was based on the original bill that
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
included cocktails to go I was not aware
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and I have not seen the
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendment um but regardless we still
 
02:20:59.790 --> 02:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
have concerns about this bill and the
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
delivery of even beer and wine I mean as
 
02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard already there is an
 
02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
executive order in place which currently
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
allows for this I still haven't really
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
gotten an understanding of how many
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants have actually you know taken
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of this what has been the Vue
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
increase around this whether or not
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
it'll be necessary after the pandemic um
 
02:21:25.469 --> 02:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly concerning to me that
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
even the Liquor Commission doesn't
 
02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
really have a great take on that too and
 
02:21:31.230 --> 02:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
I think before we go ahead and move
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
something into a permanent law that
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
really shifts our policy structure we
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
need a much better understanding of that
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
um I will just go on to say too and
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
you've hear me say this over and over
 
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
again I'm a broken record but we do have
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
to understand understand the costs of um
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol misuse not only in the country
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
but in the state and every time we talk
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
about um bills like this which increases
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
um accessibility we have to understand
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be further impact
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the numbers were already
 
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
very very high when we talk about um the
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know the major driver of mortality
 
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
with alcohol 88,000 deaths a year and
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
that was prec covid we're actually
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
hearing um from some data that I have in
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
my testimony that um alcohol consumption
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
has increased quite a bit among
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
subgroups within the population with um
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
covid and the patterns of alcohol um
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
sales have shifted from on premise to
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
off- premise
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
sales and there's certainly a lot of
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
public health risk with off- premise
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
sales um and there's a lot of stronger
 
02:22:42.429 --> 02:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
association with um harms increased
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
rates of violence alcohol Hospital
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
admissions impair driving because you
 
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
have to remember when somebody is doing
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
more drinking off premises the public
 
02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
safety guards in place like servers are
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
not there um so uh you know we have real
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about um uh delivery of alcohol
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
I I think the amendment and um the
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
Senate version might address this a
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
little bit as far as um the delivery and
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
and um a little bit more regulation from
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
um but I really think that we need to
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
look very closely that all the best
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
practices are in place um in the second
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
page of my testimony you will see a link
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
to best practice guidance for alcohol
 
02:23:31.389 --> 02:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
sales and deliveries during and after
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
the co um pandemic and I would encourage
 
02:23:36.910 --> 02:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
the committee and um the you know Liquor
 
02:23:38.349 --> 02:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
Commission and others involved in
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
writing this to make sure that really
 
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
those best practices are in place you
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
know and I will underscore the fact that
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
while beer and wine um you know we can
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
live with that as long it's within the
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
structure of um at least the amendment
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
we would have major concerns with
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
cocktails to go um just because of the
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
issues around sealed and
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
unsealed um it it goes on and on a lot
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
of states have experimented with this
 
02:24:10.349 --> 02:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
and um it's just a very difficult thing
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
to regulate are we talking about a cup
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
with a straw in it or are we talking
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
about something that's sealed um I just
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
think we need a lot more information
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
before we move in that direction uh let
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
me just make sure I don't have anything
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
else for my
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that concludes my testimony
 
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions if there are
 
02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:32.990 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions if there are
any

02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:24:35.469 --> 02:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any questions so I think
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're all set thank you very much okay
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%

02:24:58.269 --> 02:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
represents over a thousand California
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
wineries and Affiliated businesses and
 
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
we support HB
 
02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
176 uh we believe that the legislation
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
is timely uh and essential for New
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire restaurants uh who as we all
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
know are struggling with the economic
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
Fallout from covid-19 uh and this would
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
provide a much needed benefit for them
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and their customer
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
um wineries too have been hard hit by
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
the loss of sales to on premises lienes
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
revenue losses uh due to
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 uh for thousands of wineries
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
could reach into the billions of dollars
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh just in 2020 alone uh and while um
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
while direct a consumer shipment uh has
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
increased during the pandemic um it it
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't compensate for the loss and
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
revenue uh to to sales to on premises
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
lenses so uh while we support HB 176
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
there were some changes we were going to
 
02:25:56.910 --> 02:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
recommend but in light of Representative
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
Mick Williams uh testimony and the other
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard today um I think
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
those will be addressed in the amendment
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have not seen the amendment yet but
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen the Senate Bill uh and that
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
is something that we are also supportive
 
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
of uh one of those changes briefly uh
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
was on the total amount of wine that
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
could be uh delivered in a u in one sale
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think the original Bill had it 192
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
ounces we support the 1.5 leaders uh as
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
as a maximum uh which is in the Senate
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I would also note just for
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
background that there are several other
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
states that um have either uh passed
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
similar legislation or are considering
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
um similar legislation right now
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
including um Rhode Island Main and
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Are all uh considering
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
similar legislation
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
um States like Massachusetts California
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
New York um have passed this on a
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
temporary basis and States like Ohio
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
Iowa and Oklahoma and Washington DC have
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
passed it on a permanent basis so um
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
with that uh we'll look forward to um
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill uh as amended um and
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%

Association we represent convenience

which sell motor fuels we employ over
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
14,000 people uh just wanted to say NEX
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
understands and appreciates the
 
02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned motivations in the
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to address the economic
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
impacts uh the pandemic has leveled on
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
all retailers uh and especially the H
 
02:28:34.349 --> 02:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant and hospitality industry
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
however nexum is opposed to hp76
 
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
176 um you know as the pandemic unfolded
 
02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
in March and the executive orders were
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
made we did not oppose Governor suu's
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
executive orders that provided this
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility for Relief uh for on
 
02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:55.950 align:start position:0%
flexibility for Relief uh for on
premises

02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
premises
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
Peres however to make these Provisions
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
permanent is unwarranted given that
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide vaccinations are expected to
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
be largely completed by this fall
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
whereupon one can reasonably expect
 
02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
remarkable and widespread return to
 
02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
remarkable and widespread return to
in-person

02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
in-person
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
socialization and accompanying Pat
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
patronization of restaurants and on
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
other off premise or on premise uh
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
permites if this doesn't happen then the
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
executive orders will likely still
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
remain in place and these relief
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
measures will continue un and
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted uh and the reason is prior
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic there was no necessity
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
for these measures so why should there
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
be one after the state of emergency
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
orders are lifted
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
it by passing this bill the committee
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
may be unintentionally picking winners
 
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
in this category as the shape of the
 
02:29:58.269 --> 02:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
post pandemic retail will continue to
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
evolve this is not Equitable to those
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
already in this category nor appropriate
 
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
especially since there is no lack of
 
02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
outlets for purchasing Beverages and
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
wine across the state nexima suggests
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
the committee instead consider an
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
emergent post vaccine
 
02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on this issue as opposed to
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
this immediate Horizon we still in in
 
02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
doing in doing so a course of action
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
would involve continued Reliance on the
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
executive orders and once rescinded
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
revisit the necessity and justification
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
for any continuation of the measures
 
02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.750 align:start position:0%
for any continuation of the measures
currently

02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
authorized at that point in time the
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
true need and necessity will be much
 
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
clearer nexim encourages the members to
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill and re-evaluate
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
its need and particularly the
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
justification for it once widespread
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are achieved and the de
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
emergency declarations are
 
02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
lifted thank you very much uh if you
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
have any questions be happy to answer
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
any uh we do representative buroughs has
 
02:31:05.439 --> 02:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
any uh we do representative buroughs has
a

02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for taking my
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
question um and that is um do you
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
believe that uh that during the pandemic
 
02:31:22.910 --> 02:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's there's certain Market disruptions
 
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
that have happened and have brought in
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
new ways of doing business and um in
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
some cases these are actually Market
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
Innovations so do you think that mean I
 
02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
think some of these Innovations may
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually be positive so I guess my
 
02:31:39.870 --> 02:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
question is if this you know because it
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
may benefit another segment of the
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
market is is that a reason to to vote
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
down the bill
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
no I think it's um I think there's a
 
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
real key point to understand how big of
 
02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
a problem are we really solving with
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill and that you know
 
02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
we're all for an open competitive
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and I believe you know and
 
02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
even uh Mr Summers couldn't identify in
 
02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:10.870 align:start position:0%
even uh Mr Summers couldn't identify in
his

02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
testimony how many restauranter have
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of this and tracked it
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
and said you know this is something
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's really important and to me that I
 
02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
think is something that really needs to
 
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
be looked at before the state takes
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
action on this bill and particularly as
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
it relates
 
02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
to how retail is going to evolve post
 
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic hopefully that does that get at
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Abel has a question
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Moran thank you for your uh for your
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I wonder if you have any uh
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
evidence uh of uh of damage or or
 
02:33:07.389 --> 02:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
uh losing uh your your the stores losing
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
in your segment losing uh losing um
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
sales uh because of the because of the
 
02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
executive order um if you do or can sort
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
of generalize about that that would be
 
02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:24.830 align:start position:0%
of generalize about that that would be
very

02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
helpful sure thank you for your question
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I can't specifically identify uh
 
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
drops and sales as it relates to uh our
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
beer and wine
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
sales however we can point to S probably
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
a 20 to 30% drop
 
02:33:54.990 --> 02:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
stores okay uh
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
so uh Brian um isn't it true that right
 
02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:05.630 align:start position:0%
so uh Brian um isn't it true that right
now

02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
your uh off- premise licenses are
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
permitted to
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
deliver beer and wine to Consumers
 
02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.870 align:start position:0%
deliver beer and wine to Consumers
correct

02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
so if I understand is that you're
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because you but you
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
first you said you were all big for
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
competitive Marketplace and competition
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
is good if you have that right why
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the on premise licenses also
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
have the same right that you already
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
have thank you for your question uh Mr
 
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I agree 100% in a
 
02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:44.830 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I agree 100% in a
competitive

02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
Marketplace how however the pandemic has
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
created what I'd call extraordinary
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the market had to
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
change to provide relief on a temporary
 
02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
basis and that's an artificial
 
02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and we're comfortable with
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
that however to take that and now expand
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
it once the marketplace returns to
 
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
competition we don't believe that this
 
02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:17.190 align:start position:0%
competition we don't believe that this
is

02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh something that is really
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
even going to be
 
02:35:25.710 --> 02:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
industry okay well they could be the
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
judge of that but well no I and I the
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
reason I put that is nobody's even
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
identified in the restaurant industry
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
how valuable that has been for them in
 
02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
terms of their sales and and and um and
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't they haven't tracked and said you
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
know GE on an average of 10 restaurants
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase of you know wine
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
and beer sales x
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
amount right well and and vice versa I
 
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
have not seen any retailer really
 
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
promoting the fact that they would
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
deliver beer and wine to to Consumers
 
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
even though they do have the right to do
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
it um so we just because we made it it
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
because it's legal doesn't mean we we're
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
g make a judgment about whether the
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
marketplace is ready or wants this
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I it's true the legislature uh is
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with this only because it the
 
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
because of what happened with the with
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
the the governor's orders but we can
 
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
assume and I think your point is well
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
taken this we got to assume this is
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be gone you know a year from
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
now this is all going to be a distant
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
memory and so when we get to that place
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
the question then is um is you know
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
since we already allow uh on you know
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
off premise licensees such as yourself
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
to distribute to sell and deliver
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
alcohol why shouldn't we also do that
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
for on premise licenses a year from now
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
or going forward right you know and you
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
know I think it's you know it's you know
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the marketplace is going to change
 
02:37:10.269 --> 02:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
and evolve and we're not certain what
 
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
that really is going to look like yet
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
post pandemic and and I believe
 
02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
that you know the restaurants chose to
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
get permitted as on premise consumption
 
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.070 align:start position:0%
get permitted as on premise consumption
and

02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
lenses and you know that's what they
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
they got and we took the path of
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
providing off preference off- premise uh
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
permitting and licenses to sell for
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
off-site uh
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
consumption so in terms of you know the
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
state determining these different permit
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
categories ories um is now starting to
 
02:37:50.349 --> 02:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
blur those permit
 
02:37:53.469 --> 02:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
categories and you know I think that's
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
worthwhile it's up for worthwhile
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussion I think and particularly as
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
it relates to what the true need is
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to be come post pandemic fair
 
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
enough um and I and I would say this is
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
it somewhat selfishly this next question
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
but I would hope you could help me out
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
um I want to know where there is an on
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
premise lency excuse me off- premise
 
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
liccy in New Hampshire that actually is
 
02:38:21.309 --> 02:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
delivering I don't have that at the top
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
of my fingertips but I'll I can cirle
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
back see that I'd love to see that
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
because my instacart you know from it
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't because they're a third party
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
they can't do it so for my handers I'd
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
love to be order some beer along with my
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
so it be uh and I know there's drizzle
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
is out there in other states drizzle
 
02:38:41.309 --> 02:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
drizzle but if anything you can do to
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
help me out on that one I really would
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I'm sure other
 
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
people would be interested to know who
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
who was actually delivering great thank
 
02:38:50.190 --> 02:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony is
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
there any other questions from the
 
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none is there
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
in

02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:39:09.309 --> 02:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
okay seeing nobody uh we will close the
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 17 oh yeah
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
one last thing it appears that this uh
 
02:39:19.230 --> 02:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
section I was very concerned about um is
 
02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the current statue in the Statue
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're working in and that uh um as in as
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted by one of the lobbyists
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
who's Johnny on the spot um is that what
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
they did was instead of just adding it
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
to all be one paragraph they decided to
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
break it up into two sections of of the
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
statute so even though it says repeal
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
and reenacted is it is nothing is
 
02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
changed the only thing it's reenacting
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
is that it's just moved it in where it
 
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
was located in the current
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
statute and with that I will close the
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing and uh and we all you all
 
02:39:57.150 --> 02:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
get this but uh there were 20 in support
 
02:39:59.469 --> 02:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
and four posts and one neutral so once
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
you all get that you have that anyways
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
all right good we'll close the public
 
02:40:06.429 --> 02:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh so next up is that we
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%

of the amendment okay is that your same
 
02:40:33.309 --> 02:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation did you get a chance to
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
look at it I would be happy to do a
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
quick comparison of the text I'm sure
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
whoever gave you that information would
 
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
given you the Henry would never steer me
 
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
wrong you would not I I so okay all
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you all very much and we'll
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
1:15

02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
so Pam I was just thinking that if
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
there's nobody in the committee room um
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
I can certainly from my computer mute
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
the committee room and that way I don't
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
have to hear that fan when it's the only
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
problem with that is the only way to
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
unmute it is to physically go down into
 
02:41:43.469 --> 02:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
the room and so if um representative
 
02:41:46.429 --> 02:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
Osborne comes again for the exec session
 
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
I'd have to run down or else I could
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
call out to him to to unmute it or you
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
could call out to him I just it says uh
 
02:41:57.630 --> 02:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
ask unmute oh I see whoops did I just do
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
that did I just mute it not you muted it
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and that's okay it's not um you know
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
there's there's a solution to it it's
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
not the end of the world but that's why
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
as long as it's quiet there I like to
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
leave it unmuted because you know when
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
he showed up last week I didn't even see
 
02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
him I didn't because he was off to the
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
side and right so you know it was great
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
that it was all like if he had walked
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
into the room it had been muted and he
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
had started talking you know he might
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
have been upset that nobody could hear
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
him and or wondered what was going on
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
well that's what he did well he did he
 
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
did that he text me and says you know
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
can't you fix the microphone in
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
here so that's it's not a you know it's
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
not a insolvable problem but that's the
 
02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
the reason okay well I did create the
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
problem so yes are you there are you are
 
02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
you at the state house or are you in the
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
at home yeah I'm at the state house so I
 
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
can run down there it's fine I'll run
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
down there at 110 and just um unmute it
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
just just in case he shows up so we
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't have an
 
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
awkward might as well go ahead and
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
unmute it that I shouldn't have done
 
02:43:06.110 --> 02:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
that that was no no it's fine it's fine
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that I could I that if I
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
muted it that I couldn't unmute it that
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
I had to rely on that but learn
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
something new every day I know
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
you're in Zoom world all right I will
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
post the um the lunch notice in a sec
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%

04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.960 --> 04:10:06.429 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
gon

yes ma'am is it true you teach
 
04:10:15.870 --> 04:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
meteorology I do uh I I I'm not teaching
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
this semester they didn't have a any
 
04:10:18.359 --> 04:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
this semester they didn't have a any
sections

04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
available um they've been U reducing
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
sections and you know they've had some
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment stuff like that so
 
04:10:30.269 --> 04:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
being a teaching lecture not full-time
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
faculty uh I get second pickings but uh
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I do teach meteorology I also teach
 
04:10:37.630 --> 04:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
physical science and when I get get a
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
chance I also get to teach college
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
algebra and I love all of it good
 
04:10:46.590 --> 04:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
excellent is that is that your main job
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
teaching uh actually I just started uh
 
04:10:52.510 --> 04:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
year before last uh at teaching I've
 
04:10:54.750 --> 04:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
been wanting to for for a long time I
 
04:10:57.389 --> 04:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
have a friend who's a professor back in
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
back in Oklahoma and he he told me I
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
just need to do it he he gave me the
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
references and and uh twisted my arm he
 
04:11:08.429 --> 04:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
said I can hire you if you'll move back
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
to Oklahoma and I said well I kind of
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire so I'm going to stay
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
right where I'm at and see what Plymouth
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
state will do for me so I I just went
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
there talked to him and got hired on I
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%

04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:08.650 --> 04:14:08.660 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:10.080 --> 04:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
here

04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
room no I don't believe so I was there
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
just a minute ago and um unmuted the
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
machine just in case right and then then
 
04:14:28.510 --> 04:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
I see papers on a table there yeah we
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
distribute that's where we put all the
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
copies of the
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
bills might show up so that's that was
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
us it's not a person so so I am getting
 
04:14:41.229 --> 04:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
bombarded P people asking for amendments
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
a copy of
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendments um and normally they would
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
just walk into the committee they would
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
contact uh Carrie and have that and she
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
would take care of it so I I'm I'm a
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
little yeah well if if Carrie has I mean
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
Carrie has a lot of amendments and if
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
they've been sent in she has them and
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
she can send them to people I know but
 
04:15:06.109 --> 04:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
they I guess people don't know Carri
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
exists or something but so they're
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
asking me for copies of amendments which
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
is you could forward those on to her
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's my wife says delegate delegate
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
forward forward the effort for me to do
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
that yeah I say I could just forward it
 
04:15:21.630 --> 04:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
to her
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
so excuse me excuse me do as as a as a
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
freshman legislate do we have to request
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
amendments so yes so if well let me put
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
this way so if there's several different
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of process for Amendment so let's
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
say you were um
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
here in the committee and we're
 
04:15:42.910 --> 04:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
executing a bill okay uh we would not
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
vote on a bill unless everybody has the
 
04:15:48.030 --> 04:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
amendment in their hands okay and
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
normally we want to get them out so what
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
happens is but General is that if you
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
were a
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or an interested Citizen and
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
you you know there's a there's an
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
amendment you would normally call 3369
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
and get the committee office and carry
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
with take their information and then she
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
would send them the copy of the am or do
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
that okay let alone it's in the file so
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that someone could come in and say can I
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
see a copy of the me it's in the file so
 
04:16:20.070 --> 04:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
but because she's not there we're not
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
there then so everybody just says well
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
next best thing let's I'll contact the
 
04:16:29.309 --> 04:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and have him send it to me and
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what I'm I'm my little
 
04:16:33.389 --> 04:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
frustration about how we've got to you
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
know get these amendments out anytime a
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
person who's testifying is going to
 
04:16:41.950 --> 04:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
bring like for repr MC Williams she she
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
went and just sent it to all of us to
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
our emails and if someone didn't get it
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
that means it's probably sitting in
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
their junk file um or you know or their
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
you know spam file so I don't know you
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
know but normally what you should be
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
doing is that if you're going to testify
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
or if you have an amendment for the bill
 
04:17:02.590 --> 04:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
you want to go online to the the house
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
you know page where you say you want to
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
speak you know or not speak but that PL
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
that's where you can upload that
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and that would then be sent to
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%

these bills have amendments so the only
 
04:21:13.229 --> 04:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
Bill that um I wanted to pass was going
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
312 and yes I knew there was an
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%

04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
mind that not everybody got that
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment so at this point
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%

the others have amendments or not uh I I
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be entertaining an amendment i'
 
04:21:34.590 --> 04:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be entertaining a different
 
04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
motion so so
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%

anybody like to make an inexpedient uh
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation motion for me anybody would
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%

04:22:11.109 --> 04:22:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair yes I speaking of amendments
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
I literally just got oh he hasn't even
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
Jordan oler the prime sponsor on this
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't even uh sent the amendment he has
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
sent the amendment work to OS based on
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%

04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
so so you would want to wait until we
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
see his amendment is that what you're
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
saying um we can retain it but that
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
would hold up the bill for oh no we're
 
04:22:42.349 --> 04:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
not retaining anything at the moment
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%

475 and he's recognized to speak to his
 
04:23:24.109 --> 04:23:24.119 align:start position:0%
motion well basically if I remember
 
04:23:24.119 --> 04:23:28.469 align:start position:0%
motion well basically if I remember
correctly

04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh this was almost a side issue and it
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
was just it was a complication that
 
04:23:35.279 --> 04:23:39.189 align:start position:0%
was just it was a complication that
uh

04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
um well yeah we in order to do the
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
business you you know you couldn't um I
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly what it was but
 
04:23:48.870 --> 04:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
the driver's license or non- driver's
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
picture identification card is a
 
04:23:52.830 --> 04:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
condition of conducting conducting
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
certain businesses and it sounded to me
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
as though um uh it was unnecessary in
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
other words why did why what are we
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
doing here and he didn't have a he
 
04:24:06.750 --> 04:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have a good answer for me anyway
 
04:24:06.760 --> 04:24:09.269 align:start position:0%
didn't have a good answer for me anyway
and

04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
so if I could step in um we do have a
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
letter from um New Hampshire fishing
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
game that it would be a real problem for
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
hunting licenses I did I was about to
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
mention that okay we also have one about
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
the age 65 and over free entry into the
 
04:24:30.510 --> 04:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
Spate Parks right uh which was which uh
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
would be against we senior
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
citizens yeah
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
and and I uh and I as I stated publicly
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
when I when we had the hearing is that I
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
do take I do require renters to uh when
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
they when they book with me to send them
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
copy of their uh driver's license and
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
and a is to make sure that they really
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
are you know over 30 which is what we
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
require but B is that it helpful for me
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they really are fine
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
upstanding citizens and I should not
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
worry about them Runing to my house if
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
they're driver's license and the Trek
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
number and and and the contract they
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
sign and the check they sign all have
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
the same address so I know there's
 
04:25:14.830 --> 04:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
nothing flaky going on so okay uh uh
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative Aon is the next one of
 
04:25:19.469 --> 04:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
his hand up yes representative Aon uh so
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with iing the bill and the
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
reason is that the underlying problem
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
that the bill is attempting to deal with
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
is lots of other people storing your a
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
photoc copy or scan of your driver's
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
license and then um having the
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
information get out there somehow and
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
having um serious identity theft
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
problems and not having any way of being
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
able to track it down and find out who
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
was was was careless with your
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
information um the problem that the the
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
the bill attempts to deal with is to try
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
to put a stop to businesses
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
essentially U either sharing your
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
information or keeping your information
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
in a way that it's not secure and as I
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
read it the Bill's intend is to Simply
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
require that a business have a policy on
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
making sure that your private
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
information doesn't get out um since the
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
voters voted I think 89% in favor of
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
that uh constitutional amendment in
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
favor of uh protection of privacy um
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the itl and in
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
favor of retaining the bill and letting
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh um come up with his exemption on this
 
04:26:29.680 --> 04:26:30.510 align:start position:0%
uh um come up with his exemption on this
one

04:26:30.510 --> 04:26:30.520 align:start position:0%

04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
minority uh position can't be retain is
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
that correct it has to be correct so max
 
04:30:55.710 --> 04:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
your motion is going to be ought to pass
 
04:30:58.030 --> 04:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
with an amendment or is your motion
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to be ought to
 
04:31:02.269 --> 04:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
pass I'll just say ought to pass even
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
though okay I mean we I think we'd have
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
to introduce an this is the first time
 
04:31:09.790 --> 04:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
I've ever heard that uh we can't uh
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
support a motion to retain so what
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
happened was is the the I have to admit
 
04:31:18.990 --> 04:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
to you that I was a little cut off guard
 
04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
too interim study is a prevailing motion
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
but you can only use the interim study
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
in the second year of the banum session
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
so in the first year the retaining is
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
what's holding on to a bill and um and
 
04:31:39.109 --> 04:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
so no you can't use that as a mo motion
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that and I always knew that but like
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
I say I when retaining was invented um
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh it originally was something the chair
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
could just do the chair could say my
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
sense is we're not this bill is not
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so I I I decided
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to retain it but they took
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
that away and say now they have a vote
 
04:32:00.189 --> 04:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
so I it's a little disconcerting but at
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
this point the process is um you would
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to you know if you went let's say
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
let's say for instance you went back to
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
the sponsor he got you an
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
amendment you can have that Amendment
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
put in the calendar so you can make a
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
motion about to pass as
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
amended I know that that's kind of
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
bizarre if you think something should
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
just be held on to you should be able to
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
make that motion and that's what we're
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
we're behind seeing a lot of that this
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
session you have to convince the
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee of that motion at this point
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
that you got to convince us that we all
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
agree to retain it but I don't I didn't
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
think there was a there was a lot of
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
momentum for that position so okay so at
 
04:32:43.870 --> 04:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
this point your the minority motion will
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
be uh ought to pass all right are we
 
04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
ready Mr chairman I just want to
 
04:32:50.189 --> 04:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
interject briefly to say that the
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 312 has been um
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
sent out to everybody so I I understand
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%

so all right so what's the next one
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
um uh one 109 109 relative referral of
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
debts for collection anybody would like
 
04:33:19.709 --> 04:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
to make the motion on that one
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative Johnson I make the motion
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
for itl itl second by representative
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
pusk uh and and representative Johnson's
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to her
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
motion okay I had
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:36.590 align:start position:0%
motion okay I had
help

04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
um this bill requires creditors to
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
affirm notice to a consumer two weeks
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
before a bill on the service which may
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
be sent to a collections it is really
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
hard to notify someone if they are no
 
04:33:53.949 --> 04:33:53.959 align:start position:0%
longer at the address that you have on
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
file um I think it's going to cost um
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
many businesses more money than than it
 
04:34:04.510 --> 04:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
needs to um be and I think it honestly
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
is it's time consuming and most debt
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
collectors have more of ability to find
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
these people and most of these people
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
already know they owe the money they're
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
just avoiding it and so to have a two
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
weeks notice before they get sent to
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
collections I think is a waste of
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
time okay any more discussion on the
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislate seeing none uh uh the clerk
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
will call the role on inexpedient to
 
04:34:39.750 --> 04:34:39.760 align:start position:0%

although the intent
 
04:37:35.639 --> 04:37:36.629 align:start position:0%
although the intent
is

04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
good uh I have serious questions about
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
the uh personal
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
property placed on Common Ground it
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
overrides in my opinion it overrides the
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
condo association its members and their
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
rights um so that's what really bothers
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
me and uh I don't believe that this
 
04:38:04.719 --> 04:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
me and uh I don't believe that this
thing

04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:38:10.750 --> 04:38:10.760 align:start position:0%

the discussions surrounding this
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh I indicated as an
 
04:38:30.109 --> 04:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
amateur radio operator in the past that
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
I was uh
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
sympathetic uh because of all the good
 
04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
work that they do it didn't seem
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable to place any restrictions on
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
what somebody could do inside their own
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
domicile um I agreed at your suggestion
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
to request that that uh representative
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
Aldrich follow up with you and send you
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
some photos and begin working on the
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
issues and questions that were presented
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
at the time that we entertained the bill
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh sir unless you've heard from him um I
 
04:39:05.551 --> 04:39:05.561 align:start position:0%
could not I would be sympathetic to to
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
retaining this but in view of the fact
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
that he's done nothing to follow up on
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
my suggestion to him to send you photos
 
04:39:15.510 --> 04:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
and to address some of those concerns
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
reluctantly I'm going to have to vote um
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
Weston during the discussion there were
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
also some problems with the legislation
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Aldrich agreed
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
would have to be corrected but we've
 
04:39:36.670 --> 04:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen no Amendment on
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
this right so there's there's no sense
 
04:39:42.270 --> 04:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
in us even thinking about passing it
 
04:39:42.280 --> 04:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
in us even thinking about passing it
representative

04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
Aon um I received a lot of so I'll be
 
04:39:50.070 --> 04:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
supporting retain again um and the
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
reason is that the bill is uh you know
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
most of the bill is good and it attempts
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
to uh resolve a problem where an
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
antennas are being taken down um
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
by homeowners associations and because
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
these amateur radio antennas have been
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
used a number of times for
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
emergencies um including I think it what
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
was it the um we received that email was
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
it the Enterprise that caught fire and
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
lo lost uh radio communication and they
 
04:40:25.230 --> 04:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
had to use uh some type of radio it was
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
picked up by an amateur homeowner um I
 
04:40:30.430 --> 04:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
think that because especially living on
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast where we're exposed to a
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
lot of different different types of
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
disaster and a lot of different types of
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
danger near the nuclear power plant and
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot um that this is something that
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
benefits the public a lot and although
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
there may be some wording errors in the
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill um it's worth it's worth it for us
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
to keep it around and uh either ask the
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor to deal with the concerns of
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
committee members or we can deal with it
 
04:40:59.550 --> 04:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves it looks like it's just the
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
one issue that was causing a
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
problem I would have to tell I totally
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
disagree there was one issue this the
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
problem fundamental problem of this bill
 
04:41:15.310 --> 04:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
is that um it is someone uh if you if
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
you buy into a condo you are agreeing to
 
04:41:21.390 --> 04:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
abide by the condos rules and
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
regulations um and there was no Towers
 
04:41:25.948 --> 04:41:25.958 align:start position:0%
being taken
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
down you made that statement but I I I
 
04:41:30.990 --> 04:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't know any Tower was taken down I
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
know that that their ham radio operators
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
might have asked to put up a tower and
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
they were told no okay but uh the issue
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
in this case was the was trying to to
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
flush out that if somebody had the
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
antenna inside their condo
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
unit and was running wires around the
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
ceiling or whatever they did okay is a
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
condo association doesn't have
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
regulations about what you do inside
 
04:42:04.030 --> 04:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
your condos which I'm pretty much sure
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
most of them don't
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
then that's not a problem and there is
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
no problem and the legislation is not
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
necessary but if you're going to start
 
04:42:14.430 --> 04:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
using common space or use the outside
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
abilities or want to do anything and
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the same question
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
that comes up with the solar panels no
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
no yet you should not have bought into a
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
condo frankly and maybe that's rude of
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
me to say that but if you really want
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of these things and you really want
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
to do these things then you need to go
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
buy you know like me go out buy buy lots
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
of land and you can do whatever ever you
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
want with it okay and could the town
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
zoning but but you know and and and
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
there could be a town zoning related to
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
Towers all right and that so uh at the
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
end of the day that you know the condos
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
um you know have have the rules and and
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
for us the legislature to step on their
 
04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
rules and what their policies are um
 
04:42:59.350 --> 04:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me incredibly
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so and uh welcome
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne
 
04:43:07.868 --> 04:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
so are you all set max or do you have
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
your hands still up do you I I just
 
04:43:11.788 --> 04:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to to disagree with the first
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
thing that you said that it was only
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
about Towers but um antenna and antenna
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
support structure are two different
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
things um and in any case you move into
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
an area even if as a homeowners
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
association or a condo association and
 
04:43:28.990 --> 04:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
the rules are one way and then
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
afterwards people want to come up they
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
want to vote in some new role and I
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
think it's it's kind of unexpected that
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
someone would insist that you take a
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
dish or an antenna or something else
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
down that's outside that you would
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
normally expect to be an you know like
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
an like just an antenna it might be a
 
04:43:47.310 --> 04:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
tall antenna but it's only an antenna I
 
04:43:48.990 --> 04:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think that there's Merit to the bill
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
it may need a bit of work but you know
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's up to the sponsor in my
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
opinion fair enough uh representative
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
gson uh yes sir one thing that this bill
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh does not address is homeowners
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
associations and only deals with condos
 
04:44:09.390 --> 04:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
and so uh I know uh representative
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
Abramson keeps using the term homeowners
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
associations and this bill actually does
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
not deal with homeowners association so
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
just just a minor phraseology there but
 
04:44:20.910 --> 04:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
they are two different things oh yes
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh representative Terry
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
you want to speak again uh yes if it's
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
in order Mr chairman i' like to move the
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
question okay please okay any more
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
discussion well yeah um
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
I don't see any more discussion on the
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
motion so all right so the motion is
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and the clerk
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.910 --> 04:44:48.920 align:start position:0%

04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
Johnson okay representative Johnson
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
second by representative pusk moves
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate representative
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
Johnson's recognized this speak for a
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
motion so the biggest thing on this one
 
04:47:01.390 --> 04:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
was most of the they already
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
have pieces in the
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
associations where they have to already
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
do this so I see no point in making it a
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
law or an RSA to do it when they're
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
already doing it I think we have no
 
04:47:19.830 --> 04:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
reason to do
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
it right so um
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically every pool has got a fence
 
04:47:28.590 --> 04:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
around it anyways right and B is that
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
the mortgage companies are required by
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
Fanny May
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
to cover it okay representative burrow
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
you recognized to speak to the motion of
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
itl um yes thank you for for letting me
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
um speak um I actually am in favor of
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
passing this bill for one reason um I I
 
04:47:52.030 --> 04:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
um and that is protecting children um I
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
lived down the street from a house with
 
04:47:57.310 --> 04:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
a pool um that was not fenced um and
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
that was empty for two years and I can
 
04:48:01.948 --> 04:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
tell you it was a magnet for every child
 
04:48:03.868 --> 04:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood and Beyond so for
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
that reason um I support passing it even
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
to if it's to save one child's
 
04:48:12.270 --> 04:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
life okay any other discussion on the
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%

04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
motion information Mr chair yes
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
represent hypothetical here but what
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
what happens in a case where all motions
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
fail uh that that is that that's almost
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
catastrophic uh that is that if a motion
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
fails if we can't if we can't get any
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
motion to pass then it has to leave the
 
04:51:33.360 --> 04:51:34.350 align:start position:0%
motion to pass then it has to leave the
committee

04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
and go to the house floor with no
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation and prevailing motion
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
will be up to
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
pass so we don't ever want to be in that
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%

04:56:02.708 --> 04:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
legislate and uh the rec representative
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
Johnson your ni to speak to your motion
 
04:56:07.470 --> 04:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
yes this bill this bill would require
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
landlords to include resident
 
04:56:13.470 --> 04:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
residential rental agreements for more
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
than one month a statement that informs
 
04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
the renters that the landlord insurance
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
does not cover the attendant's
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
belongings with a loss of damage that
 
04:56:24.190 --> 04:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
the landlord recommends that the tenant
 
04:56:27.788 --> 04:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
insurance this bill will not prevent the
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
harm that is intended to prude it does
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
not address a situation where there is
 
04:56:38.948 --> 04:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
no renters
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
agreements uh just because there is a
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
line in the lease doesn't not mean that
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
the tenant is going to um read the lease
 
04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
or understand it um the requirements
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
create unnecessary legal liability to
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
the landlord it is a trap for small um
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
form landlords the burden of teaching
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
about insurance belongs on the
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
individual not on landlord Lords no
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
insurance requirement for automobiles
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
nor do dealers have to go through these
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
kind of um situations so why should
 
04:57:14.190 --> 04:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
landlords lastly it is not the
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
government's place to dictate what
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
should be in a um Private Business
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
contract there are many far there are
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
also way too many far-reaching
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh representative gson your
 
04:57:33.000 --> 04:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh representative gson your
first

04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
first uh I have nothing additional to
 
04:57:39.788 --> 04:57:39.798 align:start position:0%
add to it just that the uh this is
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh addition of of
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislation it's something so simple
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
that it's a there's no need to to
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislate something like this
 
04:57:53.310 --> 04:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett thank you Mr
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
chair um we heard so much testimony I
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm kind of surprised that that
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh the committee is taking um the
 
04:58:04.510 --> 04:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
opposite view of your parties uh
 
04:58:07.230 --> 04:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors um we heard lots of testimony
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
about renters in the state that do not
 
04:58:13.948 --> 04:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
understand how Insurance works there was
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
another fire last night um yesterday in
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
Raymond um a number of the tenants there
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
have no insurance um the towns will be
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
having to step in Red Cross needs to
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
step in um though I agree that people
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
should know this there are too many that
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
don't um and my motion
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I would oppose this motion I'd like
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
to see it retained and amended um as it
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
was last year this bill didn't come in
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
exactly the way we had um um had amended
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
it last year so um if if the motion to
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
kill it um does not pass I would like to
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
make another motion okay thank you
 
04:58:58.750 --> 04:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative van hunon and hton excuse
 
04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chair um well I
 
04:59:03.430 --> 04:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
definitely agree that this is an educ
 
04:59:05.310 --> 04:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
issue and that we need to educate young
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
people I do feel that if this is in
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it will be a step toward
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of education it will become
 
04:59:12.990 --> 04:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
more broadly known and it will help
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
young people particularly going into
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
their first department or their first uh
 
04:59:19.470 --> 04:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
lease agreement to uh to understand this
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
and to take care of themselves we've
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
seen the fires that are devastating the
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
front page of the union leader today uh
 
04:59:27.070 --> 04:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
shows the Rond fire to which
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative bartl alluded and um
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
although as I said I do understand the
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
idea that it's an education component we
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
need to Foster making that education go
 
04:59:38.670 --> 04:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
forward and therefore I would agree that
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
OTP would be the better option thank
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative M um thank
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I I strongly believe
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
that this uh should be added to a lease
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
agreement it's just a
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
notification uh it's very very simple it
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't cause the the landlord any
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
liability I'm a real estate AG
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
and if you work with a ton of of
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure statements and and purchase
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
and sale agreements uh it goes Way
 
05:00:16.030 --> 05:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
Beyond this in making people sure that
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
they understand exactly what they're
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
getting into this is no different than
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
that it's a very very simple way for the
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
landlord to Simply say hey look by the
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
way uh you might want to ensure your
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
property because I don't ensure it it's
 
05:00:33.150 --> 05:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's so simple I can't believe that
 
05:00:35.948 --> 05:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
anybody would not support this thank
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
you well I'll tell you um it's actually
 
05:00:41.070 --> 05:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's so simple that we don't
 
05:00:45.070 --> 05:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
want to do this um you know frankly um
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
if if the simple question is do you
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
really think the landlord's going to pay
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
insurance you know pay for your
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
insurance uh did the landlord ask you
 
05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
what your value the contents is worth
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I mean most people um don't even
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
read the lease all right they they're
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
just so happy to get the proper they
 
05:01:05.788 --> 05:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
move in the lease what I didn't like is
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
the unattended consequences of with a
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
landlord finds out that we have passed
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that says that anytime you
 
05:01:14.270 --> 05:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
sign a new lease you have this the
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
landlord is now going to say is well I
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to give a lease then if I
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't do I do I do everything verbal I
 
05:01:21.390 --> 05:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this so I think that
 
05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
would do a disservice to renters to not
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
get a written lease and know what
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
exactly what they should have and
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you know what's in the lease
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
and what's and it basically is um to me
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation is to tell
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
landlords uh well this is just the
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
beginning and who knows what else we're
 
05:01:42.190 --> 05:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to add into the statute that
 
05:01:45.270 --> 05:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
you're G now don't sign a lease don't
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
give a lease so you don't have to be
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
worried about whether you are uh whether
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're in or not you know whether you
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
have this thing Canna happen to you and
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
worse of it is is that it doesn't even
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
clear if I what happens if you don't put
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
it in the lease so the idea that we're
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
passing legis oh let just speak the that
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
we let you put something into the lease
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe may or may not have any
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
consequences to it that's supposed to
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
inform people things um I I just think
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
that that is much better uh communicated
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
by a real estate agent whoever help them
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
find that find that apartment to let
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
them know by the way uh I know I might
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
be stating the obvious but you you're
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
the landlord's insurance is covering the
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
building ain't covering your property so
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
I I think it's just a misuse of
 
05:02:34.190 --> 05:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
government to be you know forcing into
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
documents that is uh purely educational
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
I guess it's the way it's phrased So
 
05:02:43.390 --> 05:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank Mr hump but I I I I
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't disagree with you more if if
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
you have a lease agreement and you tell
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh uh your your tenants that you
 
05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
should read this and you've got to check
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
this off you've got to initial this my
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
God the landlord is totally free and
 
05:03:02.548 --> 05:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
clear you've you've accepted the tenant
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
has accepted the liability I I think
 
05:03:08.110 --> 05:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
landlords would love this or they should
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
let's put it that way thank you then
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
they should do it on their own they
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to be told told to do it okay
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh so I see some more hands up
 
05:03:20.350 --> 05:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.070 --> 05:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
you I wasn't sure if I was muted or not
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
dogs keep working so basically you're
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
trying to tell landlords how to run
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
their business it's it's it's not fair
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
government has no right to tell a
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
business bus how to run their business
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
and what to put in their lease it's
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
lease also learn to educate themselves
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
and have their parents and those around
 
05:03:47.628 --> 05:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
them educate
 
05:03:49.628 --> 05:03:49.638 align:start position:0%
them and
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
simple I I'm I'm muting you Chris we can
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
hear your
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
gon I think this becomes a a stepping
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
stone it's it's a nice to have kind of
 
05:04:07.150 --> 05:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
thing uh to to be able to sit down with
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
your with your tenant and explain to
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
them that my uh my homeowners policy
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
does not cover your your household goods
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh that you should get uh renters
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
insurance I know in places where we
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
rented that was just explained to us and
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
it was never necessarily a part of any
 
05:04:26.110 --> 05:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
lease agreement so it's a nice thing to
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
have uh but when you put it down this
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
this starts the process well now because
 
05:04:32.670 --> 05:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
not enough people are getting the the
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
clue that they need to get their own and
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
they may choose not to get the insurance
 
05:04:38.708 --> 05:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
policy even after it being in the lease
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
you now it's required that you have a
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
little line at them kind of like you're
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
as a as a real estate agent you have all
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
those disclosures uh well you have to
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
sign those disclosures and you have to
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
show as both the agent uh that you
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
showed those disclosures to your your
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
client uh they have to sign that and
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
then you have to sign it as the agent as
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
well and that's all presented in your
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
packet of information so the next step
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
is now that the landlord has to actually
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
have the tenant acknowledge uh in the
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
lease that that you explained that
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
portion then what other portions of the
 
05:05:11.230 --> 05:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
lease and it just begins to snowball
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
next thing you know the landlord is
 
05:05:14.910 --> 05:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
required to carry a renters policy in
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
his lease and yes it it starts with with
 
05:05:20.430 --> 05:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
with education but then it becomes a man
 
05:05:22.830 --> 05:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
a mandate of some kind of a purchase so
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I love the idea of telling people I
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
told my son he has to have his own
 
05:05:28.830 --> 05:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
renters insurance and he rents from me
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
and so he's on his own if he chooses not
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
to my my insurance doesn't cover his
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
Goods um but uh uh education is good but
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
hton little bit of delay there trying
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
you get your hands up yeah okay she took
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
her hand back down okay and remember M
 
05:06:00.270 --> 05:06:00.280 align:start position:0%

05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
or so um the natural progression of the
 
05:11:27.150 --> 05:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
hobby uh making wine and beer um is that
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
you'd like to at some point in time
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps make some brandy or some bourbon
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill would
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
allow those of us that make our own wine
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
and beer to do so but only from the
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
already limited quantity of wine or beer
 
05:11:43.270 --> 05:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
that we can already
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
produce um this is not moonshining this
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
is more of a craft activity on a very
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
small scale uh if you were to spend the
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
time and produce the maximum amount of
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
wine or bear you could produce presently
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
you would produce at best possibly 20
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
gallons uh in an annual basis which is a
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
work um presently Missouri Maine
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Michigan Alaska Ohio and
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island allow this although it is
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
still prohibited federally um currently
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
the ttb or the the the alcohol tax arm
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
Firearms does not enforce the small
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
scale the hobbyists at this point in
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
time they target the uh the Moonshiners
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
that are actually turning a profit doing
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
this um most of the people that are
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
involved in this activity are as I said
 
05:12:40.830 --> 05:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
Artisans uh very small scale using
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
stainless steel and electrified
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
equipment so there's virtually no risk
 
05:12:48.150 --> 05:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
of fire no risk of lead poisoning those
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
are that's in the old Backwoods days uh
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
before leadfree Silver solder was um the
 
05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in plumbing code throughout
 
05:12:57.280 --> 05:12:58.030 align:start position:0%
requirement in plumbing code throughout
the

05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:58.040 --> 05:12:59.708 align:start position:0%
the
country

05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:13:01.628 --> 05:13:01.638 align:start position:0%
um that's where're at at this point in
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
time hopefully uh we can get a little
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
traction on this this year um yes it's
 
05:13:09.070 --> 05:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
still uh prohibited federally but
 
05:13:11.310 --> 05:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
passage of this would allow New
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be right on board um when
 
05:13:16.990 --> 05:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
this becomes lawful at the federal level
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
and with that it be more than Happ to
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.548 --> 05:13:33.558 align:start position:0%
hun okay representative par thank
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
you thanks very much Mr chair um would
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
you be able to help us
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
remember the bill that was brought forth
 
05:13:46.548 --> 05:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
in last the last term didn't this come
 
05:13:46.558 --> 05:13:48.150 align:start position:0%
in last the last term didn't this come
forward

05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
earlier yes uh I have um brought this
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill forward previous in previous
 
05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
sessions and I may I ask another
 
05:13:57.628 --> 05:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
question forther question may inquire
 
05:13:58.948 --> 05:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:01.868 --> 05:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't know much about distilling
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
Liquors I have to admit that but I think
 
05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns we had was
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
regarding poisoning and I don't believe
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was lead poisoning that we were
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
worried about we're worried about the
 
05:14:16.990 --> 05:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol content and how hobbyists can
 
05:14:19.470 --> 05:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
control that would you be able to answer
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
that question yes uh thank you for the
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
question it's a very good question um
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
hobbyist and Artisan distillers are
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
distinctly different from Mass producers
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
and we only keep uh the very best um
 
05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
what they call the hearts of the of the
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
production run um
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
making liquor or distilling Al uh
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
distilling wine or wash or beer into
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
into an alcohol um it's not much
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
different to makeing jam in that when
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
you start the process the first bit uh
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
of material that comes from the still uh
 
05:14:57.670 --> 05:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
contains the tpin and the the nasty bits
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you will that have the uh the
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
poisonous uh type of alcohol that comes
 
05:15:07.708 --> 05:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
out first um in a large for-profit
 
05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
Enterprise um those distillers are going
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
to keep the maximum amount of material
 
05:15:14.708 --> 05:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
that they can so they get the maximum
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
yield on their products The Artisans we
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
do it a little bit differently so say
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
from a you know a small still you got a
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
a five gallon charge in there you might
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
you might produce a gallon and a half of
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
what you of a RI when when when it
 
05:15:31.830 --> 05:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
starts producing it's going to to only
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
run for a little bit of time and you
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
only keep the very best which is the the
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
middle portion of the run if you will um
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
by I don't I don't know what the Federal
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
Regulations are but typically on a five
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
gallon still you're going to produce
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
about a half a cup of harmful product
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
that comes out first at the lower
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
temperatures once this still gets up to
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
I believe the temperatures 168 or 170
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
degrees that's all good clean alcohol at
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
05:16:04.830 --> 05:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
so typically the uh The Artisans
 
05:16:06.990 --> 05:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
discard probably a half a gallon
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
initially so you're certain to get all
 
05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
of those bad products out and you keep
 
05:16:13.230 --> 05:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
just the best and you discard the tail
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
ends of it as
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
well ask another question further
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
question man inquire thank you Mr chair
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
so how would a let's say a firsttime
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
hobbyist who isn't getting coached is
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
just reading a recipe book presumably
 
05:16:32.190 --> 05:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
how would they know how much of the
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
poisonous product to
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
discard excellent question and uh from
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
everything that I have read uh over the
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
last decade or more years um every
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
single recipe every book that I've read
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
on the subject that is the very very
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.990 --> 05:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
and just to make you aware of the risks
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
of that and uh and there's typically a
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
chart as to the scale of your still
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
how much you should discard and most
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
people discard twice that amount from
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
initially just to make sure um also um
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
as you're producing this you typically
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
put it in a small containers so that you
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
can um do your blending just like a a
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
blended Scotch is going to be made of
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
all the the best portions or the cuts if
 
05:17:26.548 --> 05:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
you will from the at the distilling
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
process um those that first um half cup
 
05:17:32.990 --> 05:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
or so you probably wouldn't drink it
 
05:17:35.470 --> 05:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
just because of the odor coming from it
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
um it smells like Crossing rubbing
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol and nail polish I wouldn't drink
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
anyway but that's
 
05:17:44.548 --> 05:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm sorry may ask you one more
 
05:17:46.830 --> 05:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
question the nose is most
 
05:17:49.110 --> 05:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
unpalatable uh I don't think anybody
 
05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
would drink it just because of the uh uh
 
05:17:55.230 --> 05:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
the fumes coming off of it thank you Mas
 
05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
one more question sure and I'm sorry
 
05:18:00.548 --> 05:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
this is serious for me um sure I'm
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a a whiskey offici
 
05:18:04.430 --> 05:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
andado I did go to a whiskey tasting in
 
05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
in in Scotland and decided I was not
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to do it again but um but my
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
concern is if this is if these are
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
hobbyists so they don't sell it but the
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
feds are still outlawing it because
 
05:18:24.670 --> 05:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
those who do sell who is are for-profit
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
distillers have a lot of regulations on
 
05:18:32.708 --> 05:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
them how how do we we as a
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
state know that these distillers can
 
05:18:40.990 --> 05:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.270 --> 05:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
poisonous that that's a good question I
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's any test per se
 
05:18:48.670 --> 05:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh short of doing sometime of some type
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
of chromatography or you need some type
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
of test equipment to do that um and not
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
knowing the process uh for example that
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's multiple distilleries at like in
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
lenary I think uh Jenkins is over there
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
so that's an excellent question I'm not
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure how we would be able to um regulate
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
that okay okay thank you very
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:22.750 --> 05:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
mcleer yes thank you representative hunt
 
05:19:26.350 --> 05:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
how much in theory could an artisan how
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
much proof could they obtain in theory
 
05:19:32.310 --> 05:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
could they obtain
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know what grain alcohol
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
has thank you for the question
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative that's that's a good
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
question that is a function of the type
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
of still that they're operating and how
 
05:19:48.190 --> 05:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
many times the product is distilled um I
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
presume you might have seen on a uh you
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
know on a high-end uh scotch or vodka
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
bottle it might say triple distilled um
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
what that process is is just like it
 
05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
sounds it goes through the still one
 
05:20:03.430 --> 05:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
time again and on a third pass each time
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
you concentrate the alcohol further um
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
you know as far as hobbyist typically
 
05:20:11.788 --> 05:20:11.798 align:start position:0%
the type of Stills that they have I
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't think they're going to be able to
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
attain a you know 190 proof grain
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol something like that
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's typical laboratory or medical
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
grade stuff uh but certainly you know
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know 140 150 is definitely
 
05:20:26.400 --> 05:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
you know 140 150 is definitely
attainable

05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
attainable
 
05:20:32.670 --> 05:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
wow representative Burrows
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank for thank you for taking my
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
question um I was reading that methanol
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
is the greatest danger um for home
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
distillers but that it's produced in
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
such a minuscule amount as to not to be
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is my understanding and
 
05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
the the boil off point for the the wood
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
alcohols of the methanol if you will is
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the um the
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
temperature scale uh around 130 to 140
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
de so as such um your your acetones your
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
your your um your wood alcohols your
 
05:21:11.788 --> 05:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
tpin those burn boil off first and are
 
05:21:14.110 --> 05:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
what we call the heads or the the
 
05:21:16.750 --> 05:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
initial output of the still and that is
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
discarded yep and representative Weston
 
05:21:25.150 --> 05:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace um as I
 
05:21:30.270 --> 05:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
understand it there's no uh license
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
required for this right yes that is
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
correct followup further question me
 
05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
inquire so uh if there own license how
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
is it monitored how will the department
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the the alcohol regulation
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
Department know how to who to check up
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
on uh thank you for the question and
 
05:21:55.788 --> 05:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question presently um
 
05:21:58.830 --> 05:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
the home production of wine in beer is
 
05:22:01.628 --> 05:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
not regulated nor is it taxed
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
um and as we know through the
 
05:22:05.670 --> 05:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
fermentation process that is where the
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol is produced okay in the wine or
 
05:22:11.230 --> 05:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
the beer and uh from my knowledge I
 
05:22:12.430 --> 05:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the New Hampshire
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is going around and
 
05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
asking if you sending out surveys did
 
05:22:18.670 --> 05:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
you produce you know 200 gallons of beer
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
in your home well there's only one
 
05:22:22.750 --> 05:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
person you can't do
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
that I don't think it's going to be
 
05:22:27.628 --> 05:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
regulated like that um and and just to
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further from a taxation
 
05:22:32.190 --> 05:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
perspective the the alcohol is produced
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
at the fermentation level distillation
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
only concentrates the alcohol so there
 
05:22:38.590 --> 05:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
really isn't a tax basis it's it's
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
produced at the fermentation
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
process okay so Scott just make sure I
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
understand because my understanding was
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
that no matter how bad your beer and
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
wine is no matter what you do you can't
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
make anything more you can't make any
 
05:23:00.548 --> 05:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
poison you can you only it's going to
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
kill some
 
05:23:05.390 --> 05:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
somebody but you can if you distilled in
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
other words is a potential that you
 
05:23:09.510 --> 05:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
could be just distilling something and
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
fermenting it as you say and and make
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
something that's poisonous uh but where
 
05:23:18.030 --> 05:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
wine that is correct to a to an extent
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
um if you had some type of contamination
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
in your wine or beer you could certainly
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a very U poisonous uh in a product
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
that would make you sick but you
 
05:23:34.750 --> 05:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't consume it because it'
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
be so off pallet that you'd either pour
 
05:23:40.350 --> 05:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
it down the drain or again you could you
 
05:23:41.788 --> 05:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
know it cost some money to make a batch
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
of wine or beer you could at least strip
 
05:23:47.948 --> 05:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
off the alcohol and make some neutral
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
Spirits if by running it through a
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
processor of some
 
05:23:54.510 --> 05:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
sort you probably got a bad stemach EG
 
05:23:54.520 --> 05:23:56.590 align:start position:0%
sort you probably got a bad stemach EG
yes

05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
but thank you very
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
much yeah I think we're all thank you uh
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
and uh we have attorney Moore from The
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
neutral and this your does it work
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
Aiden can you hear me representative I
 
05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
can um yes the commission's neutral but
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
as as was pointed out by previous
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
speakers uh this is a uh contrary to
 
05:24:27.200 --> 05:24:28.190 align:start position:0%
speakers uh this is a uh contrary to
Federal

05:24:28.190 --> 05:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
Regulation and um
 
05:24:34.110 --> 05:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
I know in the past uh when when this
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislation has been brought uh we just
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
simply pointed it out that it was
 
05:24:41.470 --> 05:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
against the federal uh regulations for
 
05:24:46.110 --> 05:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh home distilling so we would um just
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
offer that and if there are any
 
05:24:50.110 --> 05:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh we'll be happy to take them
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
sir well just to play Devil's Advocate
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
that so is so is growing marijuana and
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
but evidently the feds don't seem to be
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
shutting that down
 
05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question sir
 
05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh I am uh um I'm I'm not a
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
policy maker so therefore I do not
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
presume to question the wisdom of those
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
who do make public policy uh I just
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
point out that uh the federal government
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
has chosen to make this process
 
05:25:28.510 --> 05:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
illegal and uh I would leave it to the
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee to determine
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
if that's something they would like to
 
05:25:35.310 --> 05:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
continue to follow in New Hampshire or
 
05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
to choose to go in a different direction
 
05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you any questions
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has a
 
05:25:45.788 --> 05:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
question um thank you chairman
 
05:25:48.628 --> 05:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
hunt and
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh Aiden Mr Moore I know I understand
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
why you kind of dodged that last
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
question but the uh the fact is uh
 
05:26:00.190 --> 05:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
hobbyist which is the word used I guess
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:26:05.750 --> 05:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um sometimes do have to get
 
05:26:09.430 --> 05:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
licenses and uh and we had the ham
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
operators those are that took quite a
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
bit of learning and and uh time to learn
 
05:26:19.310 --> 05:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
how to do it and make it work worthwhile
 
05:26:20.830 --> 05:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
and I noticed the people that were
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
against the uh the
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
antennas called them hobbyists as if
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's a nothing kind of deal so um the
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
idea that you we they can't go in and
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
give you 10 bucks in order to make uh
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
liquor or 15 or 20 bucks to go
 
05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
fish uh tells me that the state is well
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
capable of and in its rights to ask for
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh some sort of U down payment so
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
they know who is likely to be uh doing
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
this and uh I don't have a problem I
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't know I have a problem with doing
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
it actually where we
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
but the idea that the state doesn't have
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
to should not uh you should get a should
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
not have to get a permit for something
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
is not uh is is not um always the fact
 
05:27:17.390 --> 05:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe in
 
05:27:17.400 --> 05:27:18.270 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe in
my

05:27:18.270 --> 05:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:27:20.708 --> 05:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
opinion but
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes you have to get a license I
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think the uh in the past as as was
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out um the legislature has kind
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
of carved out um um home uh Brewers
 
05:27:35.190 --> 05:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
people who produce a very small amount
 
05:27:39.150 --> 05:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
of beer or wine for personal consumption
 
05:27:41.310 --> 05:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
as an area that they do not want to
 
05:27:45.390 --> 05:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
regulate and that um um there has not
 
05:27:48.990 --> 05:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
been a u uh to my knowledge we've never
 
05:27:51.310 --> 05:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
had a request for an investigation or
 
05:27:53.788 --> 05:27:53.798 align:start position:0%
any problem associated with that um I
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
think chairman hunt made a good point
 
05:27:58.548 --> 05:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
about the the the fact that the still
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
spirits um is a bit of a different
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
creature I mean it's still alcoholic
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
beverages but the now the
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
regulation uh you know should I guess
 
05:28:08.990 --> 05:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
the question is should there be
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
regulation on um you know someone
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
who how much of the regulation would you
 
05:28:19.868 --> 05:28:19.878 align:start position:0%
want to apply here uh if you were to to
 
05:28:24.190 --> 05:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
consider this um and pass it and um to
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
my knowledge uh the bureau or the
 
05:28:29.110 --> 05:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
division has not investigated anyone who
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
has been Manufacturing
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh distilled Spirits at home U we've not
 
05:28:34.878 --> 05:28:35.708 align:start position:0%
uh distilled Spirits at home U we've not
had

05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
complaints um if we had received them we
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
probably would certainly follow up on
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
them uh just to investigate uh but there
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
is uh no allowance for that at the state
 
05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
level and I'm not sure
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a a great deal of benefit to
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
have a contrary State policy but then
 
05:28:58.910 --> 05:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
then again that's that's up to the to
 
05:29:00.910 --> 05:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to decide whether there's
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
not okay any other questions for
 
05:29:07.120 --> 05:29:08.070 align:start position:0%
not okay any other questions for
attorney

05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
Moore uh seeing none we thank you very
 
05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chairman I think
 
05:29:17.310 --> 05:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative blue may have had her
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
hand up oh well I didn't see I did I
 
05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have the yellow hand up I just
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
had my hand
 
05:29:26.990 --> 05:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
up uh yeah this is for thank you Mr
 
05:29:29.708 --> 05:29:29.718 align:start position:0%
chair uh this is a question for Mr Moore
 
05:29:32.510 --> 05:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um could do you have a definition for uh
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
what a hobby desolation
 
05:29:38.590 --> 05:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh what hobby
 
05:29:43.628 --> 05:29:43.638 align:start position:0%
is uh not in title 13 no I mean we would
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
look to the statutes to to describe
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
the what would be considered a a hobby
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be based on production amounts and
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's how the legislature has
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
choosen chosen to look at this in the
 
05:30:00.030 --> 05:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
past uh with beverage you know beer and
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
w is to say it's if you're producing
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
less than this amount and for personal
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
consumption then it seems to be a hobby
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
um and we've been very uh we've been
 
05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
fine with that approach and it seems to
 
05:30:18.510 --> 05:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
work out pretty well so
 
05:30:20.750 --> 05:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
far I'm not sure if that's answering
 
05:30:24.270 --> 05:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
your question yeah yeah um just a a
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
followup um Mr Mr
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
chair um the it in the bill it indic
 
05:30:34.990 --> 05:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
Ates that the um um Liquors would not be
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
for sale or sold um Can is there how can
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
you TR how can you track that as an
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
enforcer well I think we if if there
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
were let's put it this way if there were
 
05:30:51.310 --> 05:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
a hobbyist uh home producer of beer or
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
wine who decided that they were going to
 
05:30:56.948 --> 05:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
start selling it um we probably would
 
05:30:59.190 --> 05:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
hear about it when someone made a
 
05:31:02.190 --> 05:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
complaint of something type um and and
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
that probably would exist the same way
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
with theill Spirits if someone were to
 
05:31:11.390 --> 05:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh make a complaint it would be
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
investigated and um then if if there was
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
enough evidence um you know we would
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
certainly want to advise the citizen
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
this is against the law you can't do it
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully they would stop and if
 
05:31:28.590 --> 05:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
they chose not to stop selling it then
 
05:31:30.190 --> 05:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
there are other legal remedies of
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
well uh representative Abel now has a
 
05:31:39.708 --> 05:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you and thank you
 
05:31:42.510 --> 05:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Moore um are you
 
05:31:46.990 --> 05:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
aware uh of there being any problem with
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
Federal enforcement in the states that
 
05:31:54.030 --> 05:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
have uh enacted a law of this kind have
 
05:31:56.270 --> 05:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
you heard of anything of that
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
nature I have not sir uh I have not
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:08.670 --> 05:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
that no said okay anybody else see none
 
05:32:10.830 --> 05:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'll let representative Wallace have
 
05:32:12.670 --> 05:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
the last
 
05:32:15.070 --> 05:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
word thank you chairman hunt members of
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
the committee uh just to follow up with
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
that question previously asked uh the
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
hobby distills Association um through
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
some lobbying efforts we did have a bill
 
05:32:28.590 --> 05:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh going through the Congress couple
 
05:32:31.628 --> 05:32:31.638 align:start position:0%
sessions back um um it made it through
 
05:32:33.548 --> 05:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
committee and then things happened it
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't go any further than that but we
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
did have a um a definition of a of a
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
hobby distiller uh in that in that
 
05:32:44.430 --> 05:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um and what the uh Congress
 
05:32:46.948 --> 05:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
had come up with is uh the still could
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
be not any larger than 16 gallons why 16
 
05:32:51.788 --> 05:32:51.798 align:start position:0%
gallons well that's the size of a
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
stainless steel beer cake which is a
 
05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
preferred vessel for this type of
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
activity and it also limits the size of
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
um of the batch if you will um so
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's some some help and
 
05:33:07.470 --> 05:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
again the other Provisions were could
 
05:33:10.110 --> 05:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
not be sold uh you know it could only be
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
consumed on premise but it also could be
 
05:33:15.070 --> 05:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
brought to tastings and competitions and
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
things like that um in the hopes that
 
05:33:19.830 --> 05:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps a interesting product might be
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
brought to Market as a result of a good
 
05:33:25.150 --> 05:33:25.160 align:start position:0%

05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition on the misbranding of
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol this means that they can only
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
that only that Brewery can refill that
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
container however Growlers with No Label
 
05:34:55.150 --> 05:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
can be found online and you're able to
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
fill those
 
05:34:58.990 --> 05:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere the prohibition on misbranded
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol makes perfect sense for a
 
05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
prepackaged product for Growlers but for
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
Growlers where the customer selects a
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
product and watch it watches it being
 
05:35:09.628 --> 05:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
filled it doesn't keep in mind The
 
05:35:12.350 --> 05:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
Growler usually only stay stays says the
 
05:35:13.948 --> 05:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
name of the brewery not the specific
 
05:35:15.948 --> 05:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
product so it's not even directly
 
05:35:17.230 --> 05:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
comparable to the labeling on
 
05:35:17.240 --> 05:35:18.910 align:start position:0%
comparable to the labeling on
prepackaged

05:35:18.910 --> 05:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
prepackaged
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
beer most breweries have a tag they'll
 
05:35:23.390 --> 05:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
place on The Growler specific specifying
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
which beer was filled with and the date
 
05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
limiting the potential for any
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
confusion this bill would create a new
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
section RSA 175 colon 2A that states
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
where the sale in a refillable container
 
05:35:38.548 --> 05:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
is already authorized the
 
05:35:40.948 --> 05:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
labeling on The Growler does not have to
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
match the product in it this would allow
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
customers to not have to maintain a
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
fleet of Growers for the breweries they
 
05:35:49.390 --> 05:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
frequent and encourage visiting new
 
05:35:51.070 --> 05:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
breweries for takeout without being
 
05:35:53.510 --> 05:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
forced to buy yet another
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
Growler thank you for your time and
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
consideration I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions Comm may
 
05:35:58.680 --> 05:36:00.190 align:start position:0%
questions Comm may
have

05:36:00.190 --> 05:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:36:08.190 --> 05:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.270 --> 05:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
Barlett thank you I'm sorry I'm sorry I
 
05:36:14.670 --> 05:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
was slowing on the uptake again um okay
 
05:36:17.070 --> 05:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
so it feels like we've got deja vu all
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
over again here um some of the questions
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've had on this bill in the past is
 
05:36:30.590 --> 05:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
how would whatever the Brewer is that is
 
05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
filling this Growler that has no uh that
 
05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
the label doesn't necessarily match the
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
brewery what if there's a problem with
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:51.788 --> 05:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.150 --> 05:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
beer thank you for the question um
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit already of a well a
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem with the product uh brings up a
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
couple different uh things I'm not sure
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
what you mean by it either that the The
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
Growler wasn't filled and therefore
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the product
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
because of resido or The Growler wasn't
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
clean or there was actually a problem
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
with the beer um and also as I mentioned
 
05:37:16.590 --> 05:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
since places do sell Growlers that have
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
no label whatsoever that's kind of an
 
05:37:21.868 --> 05:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
already existing problem um of
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
identifying where it come from and I
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
think that's why most breweries attach a
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
a paper tag as they fill the growler so
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
they know who filled it what it was
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
filled with because most sell more than
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
one uh option and often the DAT it was
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
filled as well and I would look to that
 
05:37:40.470 --> 05:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
tag to solve the problem you bring up
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
instead of having the label and The
 
05:37:45.030 --> 05:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
Growler uh which contains even less
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
information ask another question Mr TR
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the question me inquire thank you um
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right you're you know I'm I
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'm alluding to those questions
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
um we we buy milk in refillable
 
05:38:02.990 --> 05:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
containers glass jars glass half gallon
 
05:38:03.000 --> 05:38:04.830 align:start position:0%
containers glass jars glass half gallon
containers

05:38:04.830 --> 05:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
containers
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we try to wash them out well before
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
we bring them back to the dairy however
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly see many that are not
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
cleaned how would
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
a and but the dairy has to go through a
 
05:38:21.310 --> 05:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
sanitizing process how would a
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
brewery deal with an unclean container
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
because they can't really tell I mean it
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
may look clean but it's not um when
 
05:38:30.990 --> 05:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're filling it up when somebody
 
05:38:34.510 --> 05:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
brings that bottle in and asks them to
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
fill it and then later you find out that
 
05:38:40.628 --> 05:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clean and does cause a
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for the question um
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
well I agree with you that's a problem
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
and then that's why most breweries do
 
05:38:49.468 --> 05:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
have a station to wash Growlers before
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
they fill them it's not really a new
 
05:38:53.110 --> 05:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
problem created by this bill because
 
05:38:55.390 --> 05:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's a problem with Growlers that have
 
05:38:57.628 --> 05:38:57.638 align:start position:0%
the label of that Brewery and Growlers
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
that have the label of the brewery down
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
the street that's not really a a change
 
05:39:06.070 --> 05:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
in that caused by this bill but may ask
 
05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
one more question for question thank you
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you for answering question but
 
05:39:10.638 --> 05:39:11.708 align:start position:0%
um thank you for answering question but
this

05:39:11.708 --> 05:39:11.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill you know specifically does not
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
address that issue it says with a
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
beverage that does not match the
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
labeling on the
 
05:39:24.590 --> 05:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
container at the direction of the
 
05:39:26.750 --> 05:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
buyer so they don't have to put the
 
05:39:29.948 --> 05:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
label on it doesn't have to be clean
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
the container doesn't have to be clean
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
but if there is a subsequent problem
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
tracing it could be an issue do you
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
agree well I agree with you tracing it
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
could be an issue I don't think that's a
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
change in this bill at all because a as
 
05:39:51.030 --> 05:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
I mentioned today if you bring in a
 
05:39:52.990 --> 05:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
growler With No Label whatsoever they're
 
05:39:54.830 --> 05:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to fill it uh and I think we
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
have to distinguish what we're talking
 
05:39:58.788 --> 05:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
about labels what this would this bill
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
is trying to addess is the pre-printed
 
05:40:03.190 --> 05:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
labels that are permanently fixed uh
 
05:40:04.990 --> 05:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
often laser etched in the side of a
 
05:40:07.110 --> 05:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
glass Growler or metal
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
Growler the labels or the tags I
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier are usually just Paper
 
05:40:13.990 --> 05:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
Tags that look similar to disposable
 
05:40:16.110 --> 05:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
luggage tag or key tags they often
 
05:40:19.230 --> 05:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
attach or or even some just use a p
 
05:40:21.230 --> 05:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
piece of painters tape and write on it
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
that they attach as they fill it um and
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
so while I agree that if there was an
 
05:40:27.628 --> 05:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
issue that they had to trace it that
 
05:40:29.468 --> 05:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
would be a challenge that's not really a
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
challenge made significantly different
 
05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
by this bill than it is already today
 
05:40:37.548 --> 05:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
where filling of crowlers is already
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by uh the applicable statute
 
05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
and regulations thank
 
05:40:46.468 --> 05:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
you so Andrew you know as I remember
 
05:40:48.030 --> 05:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
reading this bill you know a couple
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and I meant to get do some
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
homework on it so make sure I understand
 
05:40:53.708 --> 05:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
what you're doing because this is
 
05:40:55.310 --> 05:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
totally different than any Growler Bill
 
05:40:58.990 --> 05:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
we've ever had before because um first
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
of all the only person the only ones who
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
can be filling this is a beverage
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so this hasn't have nothing
 
05:41:09.310 --> 05:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
to do with on premise or off- premise
 
05:41:14.150 --> 05:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
lenses this is simply about filling a
 
05:41:16.110 --> 05:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
container words I needed to look up what
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
175 2A is but and this is somewhat
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
setting up for Aiden to come up is this
 
05:41:23.070 --> 05:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
is only affecting the beverage
 
05:41:25.468 --> 05:41:25.478 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or is this some where you
 
05:41:29.070 --> 05:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
are expecting that you could go into a
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
um on premise lensey and have them fill
 
05:41:34.468 --> 05:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
a fill a
 
05:41:37.310 --> 05:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
container thank you for the question uh
 
05:41:39.430 --> 05:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly will not pretend to be uh
 
05:41:42.030 --> 05:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
the absolute expert on who is currently
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
allowed to fill a growler I believe it's
 
05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
currently um manufacturers and also brw
 
05:41:51.548 --> 05:41:51.558 align:start position:0%
hubs which the brw hubs kind of cross
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
the line between uh a little bit but
 
05:41:55.628 --> 05:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't change who was
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
authorized to fill a growler it just
 
05:42:00.910 --> 05:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
remov moves one restriction that if it
 
05:42:02.910 --> 05:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
has someone else's name laser etched in
 
05:42:04.510 --> 05:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
the side of it they're not allowed to
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
touch it this would remove that
 
05:42:08.948 --> 05:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
restriction right so what this
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
perspective is that um is I walk in with
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
a growler uh with Brand X into a
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer brand
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
Y and he says uh I I I can't fill that
 
05:42:26.190 --> 05:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
because it's not my my
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
bottle um which this legislation says is
 
05:42:32.708 --> 05:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
well you disregard whose name is on this
 
05:42:34.628 --> 05:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
this container you're a beverage
 
05:42:38.310 --> 05:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer you can refill a growler I
 
05:42:41.708 --> 05:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
just want your stuff put in this
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
Growler and passing this bill will make
 
05:42:44.638 --> 05:42:45.430 align:start position:0%
Growler and passing this bill will make
that

05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:47.628 --> 05:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
legal correct that is the intent of this
 
05:42:50.190 --> 05:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
bill and hopefully what it will do if
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
passed as is written okay cause when the
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
issue of Growlers in general why we
 
05:43:00.190 --> 05:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
haven't really gotten anywhere with grow
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
is that that is exactly what the
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers don't want to
 
05:43:08.590 --> 05:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
happen is that it would have the wrong
 
05:43:11.150 --> 05:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
label on what the product is in other
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
words that that I would venture to say
 
05:43:15.468 --> 05:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
you could pass this but have you found
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
any beverage manufacturers who think
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea because I would say
 
05:43:22.468 --> 05:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
the most of them that come to us before
 
05:43:24.548 --> 05:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
about why they're opposed to Growler are
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
specifically that is their number one
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
concern is they don't want the wrong
 
05:43:31.230 --> 05:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else's product in their Growler
 
05:43:32.510 --> 05:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
and vice
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
versa so uh I have had be um Brewery B
 
05:43:38.670 --> 05:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers tell me they would be
 
05:43:40.708 --> 05:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
happy to do it in the past whether they
 
05:43:43.310 --> 05:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
were truly happy or hiding behind the
 
05:43:46.990 --> 05:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
existing law um yeah I certainly wasn't
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh putting him in front of a hearing to
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
where I necessarily would know the
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
difference fair enough all right uh
 
05:43:54.280 --> 05:43:56.708 align:start position:0%
difference fair enough all right uh
representative

05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
vo yeah thank you Mr chair
 
05:44:01.948 --> 05:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you for taking my question
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh again this is just a followup on uh
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative chairman Hunt's um
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
comment it would be misrepresentation of
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh product I know that's not the word
 
05:44:18.670 --> 05:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
but if you give that growler to someone
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
then they could they may think that
 
05:44:25.990 --> 05:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're drinking you know x uh beer but
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're drinking y beer so I I don't
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
like this spill at all that's a would
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.510 --> 05:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
believe uh thank thank you for the
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
question and um you know that was one of
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it was limited in the
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill before you to uh only at the
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
direction of the customer because it is
 
05:44:49.750 --> 05:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
assumed already that you know people
 
05:44:51.510 --> 05:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't go out and resell Growlers after
 
05:44:53.150 --> 05:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
they filled them it's usually the person
 
05:44:54.430 --> 05:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
that got it filled is the one that's
 
05:44:56.830 --> 05:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
going to be consuming it and hopefully
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
between that and the fact that pretty
 
05:45:00.990 --> 05:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
much all I've seen put some sort of
 
05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
temporary uh tag on it to to tell you
 
05:45:06.030 --> 05:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
what it is uh there wouldn't be any
 
05:45:07.510 --> 05:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of what the person is
 
05:45:09.548 --> 05:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
drinking that would I I would think
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be a rare
 
05:45:15.868 --> 05:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:19.070 --> 05:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
ham thank you Mr Speaker um would you
 
05:45:22.030 --> 05:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
believe that I would have some concerns
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
about this I know I have friends that um
 
05:45:30.230 --> 05:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh have breweries and to me it it could
 
05:45:33.590 --> 05:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
um be false advertising somebody comes
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
in and
 
05:45:40.390 --> 05:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
buys um buys a a growler full of beer
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
with such and such a label on it and
 
05:45:45.150 --> 05:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
they bring it to a party and it sitting
 
05:45:47.948 --> 05:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
there on the bar or on the table and
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's pouring out um uh their
 
05:45:54.670 --> 05:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
glass of beer and potentially thinking
 
05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
it came from such and such a brewery and
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps just can't wait to go to that
 
05:46:02.590 --> 05:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
Brewery this beer is so terrific would
 
05:46:04.750 --> 05:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
you believe I I I think it could be
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
problematic and I and I would have
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions as to whether um the majority
 
05:46:14.910 --> 05:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question um I
 
05:46:21.150 --> 05:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't consider you know a as someone
 
05:46:24.510 --> 05:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
who uh drinks beer and and and often
 
05:46:26.468 --> 05:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
samples what other people bring to
 
05:46:29.310 --> 05:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
parties that that wouldn't that that
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
scenario wouldn't make the most sense to
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
me simply because almost all breweries
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
have multiple beers that they produce
 
05:46:37.868 --> 05:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
and offer and off and also are often
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
changing them over time and so whether
 
05:46:43.548 --> 05:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
someone did like or didn't like a beer
 
05:46:45.468 --> 05:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
it would be very unusual even if they
 
05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
saw the label of Brewery on a container
 
05:46:51.310 --> 05:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
to not ask which beer it is of the uh
 
05:46:54.030 --> 05:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
likely several that that uh Brewery
 
05:46:56.670 --> 05:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
makes before either thinking that they
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
enjoy it or or don't or don't like it do
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
or don't want to go that Brewery
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
and that would trigger the question to
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
whoever the owner of The Growler were or
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
they check the tag and that I would hope
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
would resolve that conflict uh as to the
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
second part of the question as to
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
whether a majority of Brewers would be
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
in favor or not in favor I have not run
 
05:47:19.788 --> 05:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
a survey of breweries to have any
 
05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
information on that but I would say that
 
05:47:24.750 --> 05:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would not compel breweries to
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
fill a growler with someone else's label
 
05:47:29.350 --> 05:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
if they did not want to it would just
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
remove the state prohibition on them
 
05:47:31.040 --> 05:47:33.708 align:start position:0%
remove the state prohibition on them
doing

05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
so okay uh representative
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
gson yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Prout for uh
 
05:47:44.270 --> 05:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
answering our questions today
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
so under this bill if this bill were to
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
pass would it be possible for someone
 
05:47:56.190 --> 05:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
else to obtain a growler of one label
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
with another product in it
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
or would it only be you could take your
 
05:48:08.430 --> 05:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
Growler of whatever label to a different
 
05:48:11.230 --> 05:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh refill Place whatever and only you
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
are the one who would be getting the say
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
mislabeled product or mismatched product
 
05:48:16.718 --> 05:48:17.590 align:start position:0%
mislabeled product or mismatched product
to

05:48:17.590 --> 05:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
Growler thank
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question I believe
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
the latter scenario is is the correct
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
answer uh that you would would only be
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
you taking The Growler to get it filled
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe there's already
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
prohibitions in law against you you know
 
05:48:35.628 --> 05:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
trying to go take that and resell it
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere you know sharing it with other
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
people that might come over for a visit
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh would certainly be I believe legal
 
05:48:46.350 --> 05:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
and allowed um but again the person that
 
05:48:48.868 --> 05:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
got the The Growler filled would be
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
assumedly present and able to answer any
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions and able to resolve any uh
 
05:48:56.350 --> 05:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
issues about what is in the container if
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
those Come Those came up just chair may
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
follow up just to make sure I I
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
understand something for the question me
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay so going back to the example of
 
05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
like the the uh the milk bottles this is
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's not an exchange where you can
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
take empty bottles back and then you can
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
pick out other bottles then the the uh
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
the farm the dairy would then take those
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
bottles that you returned clean them and
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
refill them this is you bringing in an
 
05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
empty container saying please fill this
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
it just ignore what's on the label and
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
then you pick it out and you take it
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
back out out with you at the same
 
05:49:32.990 --> 05:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
time correct that is my understanding of
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
how I've seen all breweries work I don't
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
know of any that have a a swap service
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
where you uh drop drop one off pick up a
 
05:49:44.350 --> 05:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
different one it's usually you purchase
 
05:49:47.030 --> 05:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
up front uh the physical Growler and
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is is yours to keep and there's no
 
05:49:49.760 --> 05:49:51.230 align:start position:0%
that is is yours to keep and there's no
exchanging

05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
exchanging
 
05:49:57.150 --> 05:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
it I thank you okay and represent
 
05:50:01.110 --> 05:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
M uh yes thank you uh chairman um Mr
 
05:50:04.110 --> 05:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
proud I correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
05:50:06.548 --> 05:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
I've been a while since I've refilled
 
05:50:09.868 --> 05:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
The Growler but I if I recall when I get
 
05:50:12.150 --> 05:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
it refilled or even if I get it filled
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
up at at the bar and take it with me
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
they put some sort of the seal on the
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
top so that uh if I sto by the police it
 
05:50:24.030 --> 05:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
shows that it hasn't been opened so I
 
05:50:26.110 --> 05:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
think that that would uh if it was
 
05:50:27.868 --> 05:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
labeled differently and that seals on
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
the top I I think that would preclude
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
there really being
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
any any problems of uh of what am I
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
trying to say
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh Federate beer so to speak am I
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
correct at
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question uh I
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
have seen breweries do that and and you
 
05:50:50.350 --> 05:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
know as I mentioned earlier I've seen
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
many use tags that just hang around the
 
05:50:54.990 --> 05:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
neck of the bottle I've seen some use
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
essentially painters tape and tape it
 
05:50:58.510 --> 05:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
right over the cap I do not believe
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's a uniform consistency in that
 
05:51:04.590 --> 05:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
process uh and uh but I have seen all
 
05:51:06.430 --> 05:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
breweries in that last couple years do
 
05:51:08.670 --> 05:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
that uh but it would not it's not
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
exactly uh as you said a seal that would
 
05:51:13.548 --> 05:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh show proof of whether the bottle had
 
05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
been opened or not since it had been
 
05:51:19.230 --> 05:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
filled um and again that wouldn't change
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.110 --> 05:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative pusc uh thank
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr Mr chair representative Crow
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
would you believe that what you are
 
05:51:38.590 --> 05:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
proposing is the norm in the state of
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania yes I would believe that
 
05:51:41.360 --> 05:51:44.350 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania yes I would believe that
thank

05:51:44.350 --> 05:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
you really
 
05:51:49.708 --> 05:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania I know they feel Growlers
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if they feel other
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
people's Growlers I think they have a
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
state standard Growler they don't have
 
05:51:58.030 --> 05:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
third party grower at least when I was
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
in Pennsylvania so representative
 
05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
Terry I'm not sure this is particularly
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
Germaine to the bill but the question
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
was raised by representative gon about
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
taking back a used Growler to the same
 
05:52:17.310 --> 05:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
Brewery and what happens and I just
 
05:52:20.110 --> 05:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to share from our experience
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking Growlers back to the same to the
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
original uh Brewery that we receive a
 
05:52:29.948 --> 05:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
discount uh on the purchase of another
 
05:52:32.670 --> 05:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
Growler so they take them back and they
 
05:52:34.270 --> 05:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
sanitize them and they use them again
 
05:52:39.270 --> 05:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
you um it was that a question to me Mr
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that was a would you
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
believe uh I would believe that I have
 
05:52:48.230 --> 05:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
not personally experienced it at the
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
brewery's eye visit but I would believe
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
it the ones I've been to in New
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they all clean it right then
 
05:52:57.070 --> 05:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
and there but but I have been to hker
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
and in uh
 
05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
and he's got a whole wall full of
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else's uh Growlers up on the
 
05:53:04.920 --> 05:53:05.868 align:start position:0%
everybody else's uh Growlers up on the
wall

05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
wall
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
there but um I guess it's an interesting
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
Nuance to me the most they really want
 
05:53:15.310 --> 05:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
you to come back and buy more of their
 
05:53:17.750 --> 05:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
of their product they don't really want
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
you to go to take your your container
 
05:53:22.910 --> 05:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
over to somebody else but but you're
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
asking for something really simple it
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
says uh why you know why refuse just
 
05:53:29.070 --> 05:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
because it's somebody else's Growler you
 
05:53:31.390 --> 05:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
can why shouldn't should the state stop
 
05:53:33.468 --> 05:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
you from doing it but so it's an
 
05:53:35.310 --> 05:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
interesting question you're posing but
 
05:53:38.548 --> 05:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
um I would venture to say that that um I
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised there's a lot of
 
05:53:41.830 --> 05:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
Brewers who think this is a great idea
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
but um I'll leave that you to to figure
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
that one out for us so but at this point
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
um that's where we're at all right no
 
05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
more questions and we'll ask uh attorney
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
Moore for the Liquor Commission who is
 
05:53:57.788 --> 05:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
neutral on this legislation and wants to
 
05:53:57.798 --> 05:53:58.830 align:start position:0%
neutral on this legislation and wants to
share

05:53:58.830 --> 05:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
share
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
one minute of thoughtful information
 
05:54:04.430 --> 05:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm afraid Mr chairman I may go
 
05:54:07.190 --> 05:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
longer than that in light of
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
the you mean you falsify your uh well I
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm going to try to
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
clarify um what uh is currently the law
 
05:54:23.628 --> 05:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
and distinguish it from business
 
05:54:26.670 --> 05:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
practices okay which are being exercised
 
05:54:30.230 --> 05:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
um the the word Growler is not defined
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere in title 13 we were using that
 
05:54:39.110 --> 05:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
as a light it's a it's a it's a it's a
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
slang term and I don't I don't mean that
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
in any type of disparaging way it's a
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
slang term that is used to describe a
 
05:54:50.350 --> 05:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
refillable container that how the
 
05:54:54.910 --> 05:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
industry views refilling uh a container
 
05:54:57.310 --> 05:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
or filling a container with be Beverages
 
05:54:59.070 --> 05:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
and beer
 
05:55:02.270 --> 05:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
um Growlers are intended for personal
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
consumption they're not intended to be
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
commercially used so therefore a
 
05:55:10.830 --> 05:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
consumer who goes to a a beverage
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
manufacturer decides they want to
 
05:55:12.558 --> 05:55:13.750 align:start position:0%
manufacturer decides they want to
purchase

05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
a we'll call a growler um and uh it's to
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
consume at home or consume by themselves
 
05:55:24.548 --> 05:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
or with friends or with wh whomever they
 
05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
wish um there is nothing in the law that
 
05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
forbids a consumer who bought a growler
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
at Brewery a from going to brewery B and
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
saying I have this container I'd like
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
you to fill it for me most likely if
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's being denied it's often on a
 
05:55:50.910 --> 05:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not that Brewer
 
05:55:54.350 --> 05:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
Brewer B feels this adequate quality
 
05:55:57.468 --> 05:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
control over their product uh most
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
manufa facturers want to have their
 
05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
products represented in the best
 
05:56:06.190 --> 05:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
possible light um but there's nothing um
 
05:56:08.948 --> 05:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
in RSA 175 colon
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
2 that
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
forbids a consumer from having their
 
05:56:14.878 --> 05:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
forbids a consumer from having their
Growler

05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
Growler
 
05:56:20.350 --> 05:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
filled at a beverage manufacturer who is
 
05:56:21.548 --> 05:56:21.558 align:start position:0%
different from where they originally
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
made the
 
05:56:22.798 --> 05:56:24.788 align:start position:0%
made the
purchase

05:56:24.788 --> 05:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
1752 is really focused at The Liquor
 
05:56:27.440 --> 05:56:29.150 align:start position:0%
1752 is really focused at The Liquor
Commission

05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:56:31.510 --> 05:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's te telling the commission that
 
05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
they need to cause precautions to be
 
05:56:38.548 --> 05:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
taken uh necessary to ensure the Purity
 
05:56:40.468 --> 05:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
and freedom of
 
05:56:45.548 --> 05:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
misbranding of Liquors sold and it
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to beverages uh it doesn't
 
05:56:51.868 --> 05:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
speak to wine so a person for example
 
05:56:53.468 --> 05:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
who bought a gr you know let's say a
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
growler of wine uh who wanted to go to a
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
wine manufacturer's facility and have
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
that refilled could do that as well so
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh at the risk
 
05:57:08.468 --> 05:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
of um trying to complicate the
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
conversation uh I'm I'm hoping to
 
05:57:16.590 --> 05:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity which um and again
 
05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
the the phrasing of Growler is really
 
05:57:20.080 --> 05:57:21.350 align:start position:0%
the the phrasing of Growler is really
based

05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
based
 
05:57:28.750 --> 05:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
upon um a term that's used in five uh
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
statutes uh 17821 20a 22 12a and 20 that
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
uses the phrase suitable
 
05:57:40.878 --> 05:57:42.468 align:start position:0%
uses the phrase suitable
container

05:57:42.468 --> 05:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
container
 
05:57:46.468 --> 05:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
and the commission has historically
 
05:57:49.628 --> 05:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
interpreted the word the phrase I should
 
05:57:52.110 --> 05:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
say suitable
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
container as that which
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
is in the ABS of something more specific
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
that that is the language that the
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission has said would permit a
 
05:58:08.400 --> 05:58:10.468 align:start position:0%
commission has said would permit a
beverage

05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
beverage
 
05:58:12.590 --> 05:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
allowing uh them to refill a container
 
05:58:21.868 --> 05:58:21.878 align:start position:0%
that is purchased by a consumer now um
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping I'm not going around in
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
circles on this and I'm gonna certainly
 
05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
guess I may have some questions
 
05:58:28.600 --> 05:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
guess I may have some questions
but

05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
um representative prout's bill I think
 
05:58:37.590 --> 05:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
is does um I I really don't believe I
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
see a uh I don't want to say a need for
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to question the
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
motivation of it but I think the law as
 
05:58:47.708 --> 05:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
it's currently written would permit a
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
consumer to go to a different Brewery
 
05:58:54.830 --> 05:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
and have their Growler filled at that
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
other Brewery it would be the prob
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
probably if it were refused it would be
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
based upon the manufacturer's own
 
05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
quality control standards that would
 
05:59:08.190 --> 05:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
probably cause them not to refill
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
it and I'll be happy to take any
 
05:59:15.990 --> 05:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:18.030 --> 05:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
interesting I've seen this before I
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
remember years ago people always say
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
fireworks are illegal in New Hampshire
 
05:59:23.190 --> 05:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
and they said that because they didn't
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
want us to have fireworks then we passed
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
it and then then hell Brook so sometimes
 
05:59:31.788 --> 05:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
people will use the law to to their to
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
their advantage
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
but at
 
05:59:38.430 --> 05:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
anyway uh I will I will let you uh weigh
 
05:59:41.510 --> 05:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
in on uh again Andrew but I'm just
 
05:59:43.110 --> 05:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
checking to see if anybody has any more
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions and I don't see any so uh
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative proud you want to wrap it
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
up with this new piece of
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
actually in light of that uh new piece
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
of information which is helpfully
 
06:00:01.350 --> 06:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
memorialized on YouTube now uh I would
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh actually Pro probably agree that uh
 
06:00:06.788 --> 06:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
considering that this is already not
 
06:00:08.830 --> 06:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
illegal and that any claims otherwise
 
06:00:10.830 --> 06:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
are do not align with the views of the
 
06:00:13.590 --> 06:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission uh I would not think
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
this bill would be
 
06:00:17.868 --> 06:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
necessary fair enough thank you very
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
much and I I will go anybody in the
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%

told the house clerk um you would like
 
06:14:15.230 --> 06:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
to to have so it could be that that I
 
06:14:18.030 --> 06:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
use the committee distribution list that
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
is set up by the house clerk I don't
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
have my own private one other than for
 
06:14:24.070 --> 06:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
the zoom invitations that's a there's a
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
big asterisk for that but
 
06:14:29.670 --> 06:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh you say on the Commerce Committee
 
06:14:32.190 --> 06:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
there's a list yeah if you just go to
 
06:14:34.830 --> 06:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee then go to
 
06:14:37.708 --> 06:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
yourself yeah you looked at the our web
 
06:14:39.708 --> 06:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
page Chris we've talked about this over
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
and over you gotta let the CL house
 
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
clerk know if you want a different email
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:54.910 --> 06:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
right okay uh we'll open up the public
 
06:14:58.468 --> 06:14:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.150 --> 06:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:15:04.510 --> 06:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
245 and here from the prime
 
06:15:06.910 --> 06:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor did he walk
 
06:15:09.788 --> 06:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
away he he did kind of he was there a
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
little while ago and then he seemed
 
06:15:14.310 --> 06:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
exasperated and walked off so I I wonder
 
06:15:14.320 --> 06:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
exasperated and walked off so I I wonder
if

06:15:15.270 --> 06:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
he forgot something or I I don't know
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
what happened but he was there he was
 
06:15:22.990 --> 06:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
there yeah I thought I saw him there too
 
06:15:23.000 --> 06:15:25.190 align:start position:0%
there yeah I thought I saw him there too
but

06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:15:25.200 --> 06:15:28.868 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:15:28.868 --> 06:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
so given that I I'm I'm doing a lousy
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
job of timing out um exec sessions um I
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
for next week I've not uh put any exec
 
06:15:40.670 --> 06:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
sessions I'm just want to get through
 
06:15:42.548 --> 06:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
all the bills we'll have heard
 
06:15:44.788 --> 06:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
everything that we're going to hear and
 
06:15:47.430 --> 06:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
then starting after that we'll then have
 
06:15:49.070 --> 06:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
it be a little more organized about our
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
exec session for
 
06:15:51.600 --> 06:15:53.190 align:start position:0%
exec session for
bills

06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:15:57.948 --> 06:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
so okay so uh we'll start with uh
 
06:16:00.830 --> 06:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative abon and to introduce his
 
06:16:03.670 --> 06:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
belt uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
members for of the committee for taking
 
06:16:08.110 --> 06:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
my testimony that this is House Bill 245
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh can you guys see me with the lighting
 
06:16:12.030 --> 06:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
I opened up all the windows and whatnot
 
06:16:17.750 --> 06:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
so well that background is know okay I
 
06:16:19.230 --> 06:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll try looking for another
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
background after I introduce the bill um
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that's been introduced a
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
couple of times before and it it is Al
 
06:16:28.830 --> 06:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
gets most of the Republicans on this
 
06:16:32.750 --> 06:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee support but not all um
 
06:16:36.750 --> 06:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
essentially House Bill 2 245 the the
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
convenience stores the wine and grocery
 
06:16:42.788 --> 06:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
stores uh sorry the wine the beer wine
 
06:16:45.788 --> 06:16:45.798 align:start position:0%
and tobacco stores have a requirement in
 
06:16:48.948 --> 06:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
place that um was added some time ago
 
06:16:51.628 --> 06:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
that simply says that if you're going to
 
06:16:55.110 --> 06:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
sell beer wine that you have to also
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
sell 3,000
 
06:16:58.110 --> 06:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
or you have to stock you don't have to
 
06:17:00.430 --> 06:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
sell it um and the problem is that it
 
06:17:04.350 --> 06:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't sell $3,000 worth of inventory
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
of grocery store like items um and the
 
06:17:12.070 --> 06:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has um some uh
 
06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations on that that those
 
06:17:15.468 --> 06:17:15.478 align:start position:0%
businesses have to
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow and the problem with that is that
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
there's no possible way to make money
 
06:17:24.230 --> 06:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
off that inventory so what virtually all
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
of these convenience stores have been
 
06:17:27.030 --> 06:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
doing is just
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
buying Kansas spam theena sausage Chef
 
06:17:34.150 --> 06:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
boy Rd um if you go into the ice box to
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
go grab a bag of ice you'll notice that
 
06:17:38.390 --> 06:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's a frozen loaf of bread in there
 
06:17:39.788 --> 06:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
that tells you that it's a New Hampshire
 
06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
store as far as I know I I don't know of
 
06:17:44.670 --> 06:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
another Northeastern State actually I
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other state that that
 
06:17:47.788 --> 06:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
does something like this or takes it to
 
06:17:50.430 --> 06:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
this level and I get asked questions a
 
06:17:51.788 --> 06:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
lot when people are in the convenience
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
store they they'll ask just kind of
 
06:17:56.468 --> 06:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
randomly or sporadically how come they
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
have an eight box of Cheerios just
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
sitting there and it's almost at its
 
06:18:03.468 --> 06:18:03.478 align:start position:0%
expiration date and we have all this
 
06:18:05.150 --> 06:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
other stuff in there and it's just a
 
06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
state mandate that's been in place for
 
06:18:10.350 --> 06:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
for a number of
 
06:18:12.990 --> 06:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
years and the argument that I've gotten
 
06:18:14.788 --> 06:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
from the that we've gotten from the
 
06:18:17.390 --> 06:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
opponents on this effort to repeal this
 
06:18:17.400 --> 06:18:18.590 align:start position:0%
opponents on this effort to repeal this
unfunded

06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
06:18:18.600 --> 06:18:20.390 align:start position:0%
unfunded
mandate

06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
is more often than not that they would
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
like to send a message that they want
 
06:18:31.468 --> 06:18:31.478 align:start position:0%
people eating food with beer or wine um
 
06:18:33.350 --> 06:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with the idea that
 
06:18:35.030 --> 06:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
people should be eating food but the
 
06:18:39.070 --> 06:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
kind of food that's being Stu is the
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
stuff that doesn't expire even after a
 
06:18:44.948 --> 06:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
year it's sugary
 
06:18:47.708 --> 06:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
starchy uh loaded with preservatives and
 
06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's the the kind of stuff that I would
 
06:18:51.390 --> 06:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
I would probably discourage people from
 
06:18:52.628 --> 06:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
eating I'm not a professional
 
06:18:55.310 --> 06:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
nutritionist but uh when I'm eating
 
06:18:55.320 --> 06:18:56.750 align:start position:0%
nutritionist but uh when I'm eating
healthy

06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
06:19:00.030 --> 06:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
um the last place I'm going to go and
 
06:19:03.750 --> 06:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
pick up food is the convenience store
 
06:19:04.830 --> 06:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
understand they have lots of bags of
 
06:19:06.750 --> 06:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
chips but they also have to stock up on
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
all sorts of canned items um boxes of
 
06:19:11.230 --> 06:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hamburger Helper that have been sitting
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
there for a year boxes of cereal that
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
have been sitting there for a year uh of
 
06:19:17.070 --> 06:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
course the Frozen loaf of bread that's
 
06:19:19.230 --> 06:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
been sitting in the ice box for a year
 
06:19:22.230 --> 06:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that these cans and boxes are
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
just sitting there accumulating you know
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
more and more dust
 
06:19:30.350 --> 06:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
um contributes to a lot of other health
 
06:19:33.390 --> 06:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
issues um including the accumulation of
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
fungus bacteria viruses and who El who
 
06:19:39.830 --> 06:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
knows what um what's on them food is not
 
06:19:42.750 --> 06:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to sit in inventory for long
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
periods of time and and to argue that
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
this is a healthier way um I think what
 
06:19:53.310 --> 06:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
happened in the last hearing uh maybe
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt can remember but I think
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
they finally conceded that that they
 
06:19:59.230 --> 06:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily want people eating
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
this food but they wanted to send a
 
06:20:03.070 --> 06:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
message to people who are consuming
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol that they wanted them to eat
 
06:20:09.070 --> 06:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
food with their 30 pack of PS Blue
 
06:20:11.190 --> 06:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
Ribbon or whatever they're going to
 
06:20:12.510 --> 06:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going to have I don't I
 
06:20:14.788 --> 06:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure that adding more
 
06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
calories to an unhealthy diet um of
 
06:20:22.430 --> 06:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol is is necessarily helping
 
06:20:22.440 --> 06:20:24.430 align:start position:0%
alcohol is is necessarily helping
anyone

06:20:24.430 --> 06:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the the other concern is that when I
 
06:20:30.030 --> 06:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
see the look on people's faces it seems
 
06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
to break down their sense of respect for
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
the rule of law that our job as
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
legislators is to add modify and also
 
06:20:41.788 --> 06:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
repeal outdated laws or laws that don't
 
06:20:44.910 --> 06:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
make any sense and when they see that
 
06:20:47.788 --> 06:20:47.798 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place requiring that
 
06:20:50.708 --> 06:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
stores stock up on Things That No One
 
06:20:53.468 --> 06:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
buys it's so dubious it's so
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
questionable that it it it kind of
 
06:20:58.430 --> 06:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
destroys people's faith in the in the
 
06:20:58.440 --> 06:20:59.670 align:start position:0%
destroys people's faith in the in the
Democratic

06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic
 
06:21:02.468 --> 06:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
process that if there's no apparent
 
06:21:04.270 --> 06:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
reason or if the reason is really
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
complicated or if the reason seems to be
 
06:21:08.750 --> 06:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
cronyism or protectionism that there's
 
06:21:11.230 --> 06:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
some established business over here
 
06:21:14.150 --> 06:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
lobbying to protect themselves from
 
06:21:16.750 --> 06:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
competition it even appears that way it
 
06:21:18.788 --> 06:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
it breaks down people's faith in the
 
06:21:21.390 --> 06:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
process and it and it tends to break it
 
06:21:23.110 --> 06:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
down from a pretty young
 
06:21:26.468 --> 06:21:26.478 align:start position:0%
age um I've
 
06:21:29.708 --> 06:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
um I have been working for years part of
 
06:21:32.150 --> 06:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's dumus law and other
 
06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
efforts to repeal old outdated and
 
06:21:36.868 --> 06:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
ridiculous laws that don't make any
 
06:21:39.430 --> 06:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
sense um but that are not enforced but
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
this one is enforced and when we talk to
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
store owners um when they have their
 
06:21:48.190 --> 06:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
smaller convenience stores they'd like
 
06:21:51.150 --> 06:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to sell more beer wine and
 
06:21:52.990 --> 06:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco products more specialized
 
06:21:54.350 --> 06:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
products that can attract people from
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
the New England Market um we do compete
 
06:21:59.788 --> 06:21:59.798 align:start position:0%
with uh stores that are in six other
 
06:22:02.750 --> 06:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
states Northeastern states and people do
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
make the drive up to New Hampshire to
 
06:22:06.830 --> 06:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
stock up I I live on the border and so I
 
06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
see it all the time I see out ofate
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
plates here all the time as people come
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
in to do their shopping I think it's 40
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
or 45% of all retail sales in New
 
06:22:17.868 --> 06:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are from out ofate
 
06:22:20.150 --> 06:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
Shoppers and half of the New Hampshire
 
06:22:22.430 --> 06:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
Advantage is the lower taxes but the
 
06:22:23.948 --> 06:22:23.958 align:start position:0%
other half is that we're kind of the
 
06:22:26.510 --> 06:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
live for your die state that we don't
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
have all the restrictions uh and
 
06:22:30.590 --> 06:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
limitations that a lot of other states
 
06:22:32.468 --> 06:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
have that that we don't kind of cut
 
06:22:36.270 --> 06:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
people off um we don't try to regulate
 
06:22:37.708 --> 06:22:37.718 align:start position:0%
business to death we don't try to ban
 
06:22:41.948 --> 06:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
things to death so this isn't um by
 
06:22:45.190 --> 06:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
opening up this part of the
 
06:22:47.430 --> 06:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
marketplace um to allow these small
 
06:22:49.548 --> 06:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
grossers to carry more specialized items
 
06:22:51.150 --> 06:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
and more New Hampshire made items and
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
more of the um more of the products of
 
06:22:56.910 --> 06:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
Nano Brewery there's a lot of innovation
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
going on right now in vaping and in
 
06:23:01.708 --> 06:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
micro Brews and anal breweries and I
 
06:23:04.628 --> 06:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
think that passing a bill like this and
 
06:23:06.910 --> 06:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
repealing this replacing $33,000 worth
 
06:23:10.150 --> 06:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
of Dusty Kansas fam replacing that with
 
06:23:12.150 --> 06:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
actual New Hampshire made inventory I
 
06:23:14.670 --> 06:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
think would be uh much much better of
 
06:23:18.750 --> 06:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
course I am open to to Amendment um if
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
members have uh um ideas I'd like to get
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
that in today or tomorrow so um
 
06:23:28.590 --> 06:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
but uh I've always thought that it it
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
made sense for convenience stores maybe
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
to hand handle a few hundred dollars
 
06:23:35.670 --> 06:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
worth of emergency flares and emergency
 
06:23:37.708 --> 06:23:37.718 align:start position:0%
supplies and first aid kits and things
 
06:23:39.868 --> 06:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
like that the type of inventory you need
 
06:23:42.070 --> 06:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
in a power outage or a car crash or some
 
06:23:43.948 --> 06:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
other type of emergency that's always
 
06:23:46.708 --> 06:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
made more sense to me rather than you
 
06:23:48.990 --> 06:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
know $33,000 worth
 
06:23:53.310 --> 06:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
sold and I'll take questions
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay we do have questions uh
 
06:24:00.830 --> 06:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative burrow is
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
first yes thanks for taking my question
 
06:24:07.670 --> 06:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and um my question is might I mean I
 
06:24:08.868 --> 06:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
think a lot of what you're saying makes
 
06:24:11.590 --> 06:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
sense but my question is might this bill
 
06:24:14.350 --> 06:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
be a workaround for a convenience store
 
06:24:16.670 --> 06:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
which is by definition a store that
 
06:24:20.110 --> 06:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
sells also sells food to become a liquor
 
06:24:22.468 --> 06:24:22.478 align:start position:0%
store no they're not allowed to sell
 
06:24:25.548 --> 06:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
liquor um they are allowed to sell beer
 
06:24:28.390 --> 06:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
and wine and tobacco products uh of
 
06:24:31.468 --> 06:24:31.478 align:start position:0%
course um the the the question that
 
06:24:33.510 --> 06:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're kind of asking or the question
 
06:24:36.468 --> 06:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
we're kind of answering is uh what do
 
06:24:39.788 --> 06:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
you do with this 15 square feet or so of
 
06:24:42.750 --> 06:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
space is it going to be $3,000 worth of
 
06:24:44.590 --> 06:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
food that doesn't buy or sell or is it
 
06:24:47.708 --> 06:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
going to be $3,000 worth of you know
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
something from a micro brewery beer
 
06:24:52.910 --> 06:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
products beer and wine products um
 
06:24:54.310 --> 06:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
convenient stores aren't allowed to sell
 
06:24:57.510 --> 06:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
is thank you okay uh representative V
 
06:25:04.510 --> 06:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
outon thank you very much and thank you
 
06:25:07.628 --> 06:25:07.638 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm not sure that I
 
06:25:09.430 --> 06:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
that I buy your classification of
 
06:25:11.708 --> 06:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
convenience stores or of this type of
 
06:25:13.750 --> 06:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
store because they can just be that
 
06:25:15.868 --> 06:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
convenience stores a place to which a
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
family without transportation or a lot
 
06:25:20.670 --> 06:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
of money can walk to buy the the daily
 
06:25:23.150 --> 06:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
Essentials that they have um what makes
 
06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
you think though that the New Hampshire
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
made item items would sell better in a
 
06:25:30.030 --> 06:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
store that tends to be a corner store uh
 
06:25:31.910 --> 06:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's available mostly to people
 
06:25:35.070 --> 06:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
without major sources of income uh who
 
06:25:36.750 --> 06:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
use the corner store to pick things up
 
06:25:38.750 --> 06:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
on maybe a daily or weekly basis and
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't go for a major shopping and for a
 
06:25:42.948 --> 06:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
healthier shopping I hope I didn't get
 
06:25:44.468 --> 06:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
too intricate there I
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
apologize so the definition I should
 
06:25:48.910 --> 06:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
have mentioned this earlier is it's RSA
 
06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
175 Section 1 part 36 which is just
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
quote unquote grocery or convenience
 
06:25:58.230 --> 06:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
store unquote means any retail
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
establishment where groceries are
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
regularly and customarily sold for
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
consumption off
 
06:26:06.270 --> 06:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
premises um I believe in letting the
 
06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace work that it makes sense to
 
06:26:12.390 --> 06:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
let the suppliers Supply what people are
 
06:26:16.270 --> 06:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
actually buying um I do live close to
 
06:26:19.830 --> 06:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
about six of these small groceries or
 
06:26:22.590 --> 06:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
Convenience Stores um and I do walk to
 
06:26:25.548 --> 06:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
them about once a day um because it
 
06:26:27.788 --> 06:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
saves me having to start up the car and
 
06:26:29.548 --> 06:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
and you know deise the windows and
 
06:26:31.430 --> 06:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
everything so that's a convenience for
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
me but it it's also a convenience to be
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to go go down to the convenience
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
store and pick things up but with six
 
06:26:40.390 --> 06:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
grocery stores nearby obviously one of
 
06:26:43.110 --> 06:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
them is you know about 30,000 square
 
06:26:47.030 --> 06:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
feet and it has lots of of grocery items
 
06:26:49.230 --> 06:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
why should the other five also have to
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
stock Things That No One buys or very
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
very few people buy if somebody somebody
 
06:26:59.948 --> 06:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
who lives in my area um in Seabrook
 
06:27:01.948 --> 06:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
wants to just walk somewhere or their
 
06:27:04.430 --> 06:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
car isn't working um they'll go to the
 
06:27:06.510 --> 06:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
big grow they'll go to the big one uh
 
06:27:08.430 --> 06:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
the one that's right on the border um
 
06:27:10.350 --> 06:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
because it is about 30,000 square feet
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a really good siiz
 
06:27:15.548 --> 06:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
facility we actually have several very
 
06:27:19.548 --> 06:27:19.558 align:start position:0%
large um you know wine and tobacco
 
06:27:21.868 --> 06:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
stores wine and beer stores in New
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Seabrook that also have lot
 
06:27:27.868 --> 06:27:27.878 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of this kind of inventory
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
um some that even compete with with uh
 
06:27:33.548 --> 06:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
grocery stores as far as snack food
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
items are
 
06:27:37.868 --> 06:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
concerned but it it doesn't make sense
 
06:27:40.510 --> 06:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
to mandate to push a top down one size
 
06:27:42.750 --> 06:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
fits-all mandate on every kind of store
 
06:27:46.110 --> 06:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
when you've got most convenience stores
 
06:27:48.190 --> 06:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
in the state have at least one or two
 
06:27:50.230 --> 06:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
other convenient stores nearby it
 
06:27:51.868 --> 06:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to try to turn them
 
06:27:54.670 --> 06:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
all into small Grocers if if that's not
 
06:27:56.510 --> 06:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
what the the Market's calling
 
06:27:59.430 --> 06:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
for followup please other question may
 
06:28:01.788 --> 06:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you uh and while that may
 
06:28:04.070 --> 06:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
be true in your area along the border
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
and and to a great degree in my area
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
here in Manchester um is it possible
 
06:28:11.270 --> 06:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the convenience stores give a
 
06:28:13.030 --> 06:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
greater service to those people in the
 
06:28:15.310 --> 06:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
further northern areas of our state
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you actually used to live um yeah
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
I used to live uh
 
06:28:24.150 --> 06:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
in I thinking Deerfield and there was a
 
06:28:26.548 --> 06:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
a convenience store and because they
 
06:28:30.510 --> 06:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
were just kind of the one store in town
 
06:28:32.190 --> 06:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
um or the one store that was in walking
 
06:28:34.030 --> 06:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
distance they stocked a lot of extra
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
food items but none of the fresh food
 
06:28:38.788 --> 06:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
hot food items that they were selling
 
06:28:41.788 --> 06:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
counted towards this $3,000 requirement
 
06:28:44.548 --> 06:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
so in their case they had
 
06:28:47.590 --> 06:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
to um set aside some of the space that
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
might have been used for food products
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
that people actually buy in order to
 
06:28:53.230 --> 06:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
stock up
 
06:28:57.548 --> 06:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
$3,000 of this kind of um
 
06:29:00.750 --> 06:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale um Dusty cans of spam Dusty
 
06:29:02.708 --> 06:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
cans of Vienna sausage $8 box of
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
Cheerios and so forth it it makes sense
 
06:29:08.030 --> 06:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
just to let businesses Supply what
 
06:29:10.670 --> 06:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
consumers are actually buying and not
 
06:29:13.948 --> 06:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
make them stock up on material that
 
06:29:18.310 --> 06:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
people do not buy thank
 
06:29:20.628 --> 06:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
06:29:23.070 --> 06:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
Belo thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question is the intent of this
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill um to create beer and wine stores
 
06:29:33.750 --> 06:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
you referred to beer and wine stores
 
06:29:38.030 --> 06:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
earlier could you explain why you called
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
beer and wine store the same thing as a
 
06:29:39.840 --> 06:29:41.468 align:start position:0%
beer and wine store the same thing as a
convenience

06:29:41.468 --> 06:29:41.478 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
06:29:44.788 --> 06:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
store um the statute calls them grocery
 
06:29:47.510 --> 06:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
or convenience store and that's the
 
06:29:49.708 --> 06:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
license that they get um that's the
 
06:29:52.670 --> 06:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
license that the state issues for them
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
um but they primarily sell beer wine
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
tobacco uh some of them sell a lot of
 
06:30:01.548 --> 06:30:01.558 align:start position:0%
other items like big gos nachos hot dogs
 
06:30:03.110 --> 06:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing but they they
 
06:30:05.708 --> 06:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
have to adapt to kind of what's there in
 
06:30:07.350 --> 06:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
the market the buyers versus the
 
06:30:11.150 --> 06:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
competitors that they have um
 
06:30:14.190 --> 06:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
so some of them in order to compete they
 
06:30:15.468 --> 06:30:15.478 align:start position:0%
know that they're competing in the whole
 
06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
New England Marketplace not just in
 
06:30:19.030 --> 06:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
their particular Town most the
 
06:30:20.830 --> 06:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
convenience store purchases are actually
 
06:30:22.830 --> 06:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
from people out of town and a lot of
 
06:30:24.430 --> 06:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
them on the on the border where I am are
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
from m state so they need in those cases
 
06:30:29.990 --> 06:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
in those exceptional cases they need to
 
06:30:33.310 --> 06:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
be able to stock up on uh specialized
 
06:30:35.310 --> 06:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco products specialized vaping
 
06:30:35.320 --> 06:30:36.708 align:start position:0%
tobacco products specialized vaping
products

06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:30:39.548 --> 06:30:39.558 align:start position:0%
specialized you know wines that are
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
being made in New Hampshire beers that
 
06:30:43.590 --> 06:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
are being made in New Hampshire um or in
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the New England Market that are that are
 
06:30:47.230 --> 06:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
that are different where they can
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
attract buyers to those stores um and
 
06:30:52.628 --> 06:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
you can't do that if you're if you're
 
06:30:54.830 --> 06:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know have two aisles that are
 
06:30:56.590 --> 06:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to just complying with the
 
06:31:00.388 --> 06:31:00.398 align:start position:0%
state mandate and um people go according
 
06:31:02.830 --> 06:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
to some of the cash register employees
 
06:31:05.310 --> 06:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
will go you know a couple of weeks
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
without a single sale from either of
 
06:31:07.360 --> 06:31:09.350 align:start position:0%
without a single sale from either of
those

06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:31:12.030 --> 06:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
aisles follow up Mr chair there the
 
06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
question being
 
06:31:17.948 --> 06:31:17.958 align:start position:0%
inquire um you called this an unfunded
 
06:31:21.310 --> 06:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
mandate could you explain that it's a
 
06:31:24.190 --> 06:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
mandate and there's not a single Dollar
 
06:31:26.150 --> 06:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
in funding going down to any of these
 
06:31:29.310 --> 06:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
stores they're just they lose sales um
 
06:31:30.868 --> 06:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
the only thing that they save money on
 
06:31:33.548 --> 06:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
is business taxes 70% of state revenue
 
06:31:35.948 --> 06:31:35.958 align:start position:0%
comes from from business taxes so this
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
is really our our tax base that we're
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about um an unfunded mandate
 
06:31:44.868 --> 06:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
means that the store owner has to pay
 
06:31:46.628 --> 06:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
for it to hold all this inventory that
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't move and the state doesn't
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
compensate them in any way except that
 
06:31:54.190 --> 06:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
of course with the business profits tax
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
if you're profits are lower you're
 
06:31:56.910 --> 06:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
paying less money to the state and
 
06:31:59.868 --> 06:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but that causes a a
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
revenue shortfall for us up
 
06:32:05.750 --> 06:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
here all right thank
 
06:32:11.030 --> 06:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
you okay uh any more questions
 
06:32:16.388 --> 06:32:16.398 align:start position:0%
for represent Aon seeing none uh okay
 
06:32:23.030 --> 06:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:25.990 --> 06:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
neutral thank you Mr chairman
 
06:32:29.948 --> 06:32:29.958 align:start position:0%
um just so that uh the committee is
 
06:32:32.430 --> 06:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
aware every licensed type in the state
 
06:32:35.070 --> 06:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire regardless of what type
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is has as a part of it a
 
06:32:39.600 --> 06:32:41.350 align:start position:0%
that is has as a part of it a
prerequisite

06:32:41.350 --> 06:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
prerequisite
 
06:32:44.990 --> 06:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
qualifying uh condition or conditions so
 
06:32:47.788 --> 06:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
for example if I want to be uh a
 
06:32:49.948 --> 06:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
restaurant uh I have to have food
 
06:32:53.830 --> 06:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
available and um I may not want food
 
06:32:56.990 --> 06:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
available but that's what I've been told
 
06:33:00.030 --> 06:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh is the requirement for me to be
 
06:33:01.830 --> 06:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to hold the license type that
 
06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have the same exists for convenience
 
06:33:07.868 --> 06:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
stores and grocery stores they are
 
06:33:11.030 --> 06:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
convenience stores the the intent is to
 
06:33:14.030 --> 06:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
really um the legislature has in the
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
past put uh in place a definition that
 
06:33:19.948 --> 06:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
says this is the type of products that
 
06:33:23.030 --> 06:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
you should have that they believe to be
 
06:33:27.150 --> 06:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
items that are of a convenience um and
 
06:33:27.160 --> 06:33:28.788 align:start position:0%
items that are of a convenience um and
that

06:33:28.788 --> 06:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:33:32.510 --> 06:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
the businesses are you know if there are
 
06:33:34.990 --> 06:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
six businesses just as an example in the
 
06:33:38.430 --> 06:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
same area competing um they're all
 
06:33:40.750 --> 06:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
competing at the same on the same
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
footing uh not one has an advantage over
 
06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
the other except for maybe their
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
location and their
 
06:33:52.230 --> 06:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
pricing um so we feel that the system as
 
06:33:55.230 --> 06:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
it exists based upon its uh
 
06:33:57.910 --> 06:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
being a definitional based
 
06:34:02.750 --> 06:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
system U works and if the requirement
 
06:34:06.628 --> 06:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
for um carrying con uh convenience items
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
food regularly commonly sound sold
 
06:34:13.628 --> 06:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
grocery products excuse me um then there
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
is no threshold other than to have four
 
06:34:20.910 --> 06:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
walls and now anybody can open a a beer
 
06:34:25.030 --> 06:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
store if they wish um and
 
06:34:27.190 --> 06:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that how that would work
 
06:34:30.590 --> 06:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily with for example um local
 
06:34:32.830 --> 06:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
zoning and some of the things that would
 
06:34:36.910 --> 06:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
be part of um the local consideration
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
and permitting process uh but the we've
 
06:34:44.430 --> 06:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
not heard any complaints from anyone uh
 
06:34:47.788 --> 06:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
over the years from any L that I've ever
 
06:34:49.708 --> 06:34:49.718 align:start position:0%
had an experience with who said I I
 
06:34:51.788 --> 06:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
don't have enough shelf space for my
 
06:34:55.110 --> 06:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
beer I need more shelf space
 
06:34:57.868 --> 06:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
they have what they have and if they
 
06:34:59.990 --> 06:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
sell all that they have they can get
 
06:35:03.628 --> 06:35:03.638 align:start position:0%
more deliveries and sell more and uh so
 
06:35:06.830 --> 06:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
the system that we have is is really one
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
um that is consistent with every other
 
06:35:13.190 --> 06:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
aspect of title 13 and how licenses are
 
06:35:16.910 --> 06:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
issued and uh changing them changing
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
this particular segment of the market
 
06:35:22.350 --> 06:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
where there are I believe over
 
06:35:25.150 --> 06:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
1,400 licenses
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
then that is going to have a pretty
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
significant uh possible impact now I I
 
06:35:33.510 --> 06:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there this change
 
06:35:36.030 --> 06:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
would prohibit anyone from bringing in
 
06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
groceries they'd bring in what they
 
06:35:40.350 --> 06:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
wanted but um it would change the
 
06:35:42.510 --> 06:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
threshold for eligibility and that would
 
06:35:44.150 --> 06:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
be a pretty significant change within
 
06:35:44.160 --> 06:35:46.510 align:start position:0%
be a pretty significant change within
title

06:35:46.510 --> 06:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
13 and I'll be happy to take any
 
06:35:52.430 --> 06:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions great uh representative Abel
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
has a
 
06:35:58.628 --> 06:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um um Mr MOA am I
 
06:36:03.110 --> 06:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
am I correct that if a store chose not
 
06:36:07.430 --> 06:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
to sell beer or wine that they would not
 
06:36:08.910 --> 06:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
need to get a license and they could
 
06:36:11.230 --> 06:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
sell anything else that they wanted this
 
06:36:15.070 --> 06:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
is only only to get a a license to sell
 
06:36:18.190 --> 06:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
those that that this requirement
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
exists uh thank you for your question
 
06:36:22.990 --> 06:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes convenience stores
 
06:36:25.590 --> 06:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
are uh there I mean there are some that
 
06:36:28.190 --> 06:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
exist that don't sell beer and wine but
 
06:36:31.030 --> 06:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is the eligibility piece that uh
 
06:36:33.990 --> 06:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
is put in place to be able to sell beer
 
06:36:38.990 --> 06:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and wine under the provisions of uh RSA
 
06:36:39.000 --> 06:36:40.750 align:start position:0%
and wine under the provisions of uh RSA
178

06:36:40.750 --> 06:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
178
 
06:36:40.760 --> 06:36:42.830 align:start position:0%
178
um

06:36:42.830 --> 06:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
18 so um that's where the linkage is the
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
definition of that is before you is is
 
06:36:55.788 --> 06:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
linked to the requirements in rsa1 78
 
06:37:03.150 --> 06:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
license well Set uh representative
 
06:37:10.708 --> 06:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
Herbert thank you chairman
 
06:37:13.788 --> 06:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
hunt um and thank you Mr Moore for
 
06:37:15.230 --> 06:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
06:37:15.240 --> 06:37:18.270 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

06:37:18.270 --> 06:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:23.070 --> 06:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
if if this uh this hurdle uh for uh
 
06:37:25.548 --> 06:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
things other than alcohol
 
06:37:28.750 --> 06:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
are uh was was to be
 
06:37:33.628 --> 06:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
eliminated and if that meant all they
 
06:37:35.590 --> 06:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
carry were like package stores except
 
06:37:38.110 --> 06:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's just beer and wine would that
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
06:37:41.948 --> 06:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
profits for the state more than the
 
06:37:41.958 --> 06:37:45.628 align:start position:0%
profits for the state more than the
existing

06:37:45.628 --> 06:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:49.388 --> 06:37:49.398 align:start position:0%
setup uh thank you for your question uh
 
06:37:51.548 --> 06:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that I
 
06:37:53.708 --> 06:37:53.718 align:start position:0%
don't we've not been asked to provide uh
 
06:37:56.750 --> 06:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
anytime of fiscal uh worksheet
 
06:37:58.670 --> 06:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
bill the
 
06:38:02.948 --> 06:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
think I think business people if feel if
 
06:38:08.388 --> 06:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
they felt that there was an
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to make money they would
 
06:38:14.708 --> 06:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
locate themselves in a position you know
 
06:38:17.310 --> 06:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
as uh representative abson describes in
 
06:38:20.350 --> 06:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
seab Brook there are maybe six stores
 
06:38:22.670 --> 06:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
within close proximity to one another
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sure each of those owners felt
 
06:38:26.310 --> 06:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's worth my time even though there's
 
06:38:28.230 --> 06:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
competition right down the street it's
 
06:38:30.910 --> 06:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
worth my time I can get my market share
 
06:38:33.388 --> 06:38:33.398 align:start position:0%
by locating here they've made a a
 
06:38:35.830 --> 06:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
conscious business decision to move uh
 
06:38:37.310 --> 06:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
forward in that
 
06:38:41.910 --> 06:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
regard if this requirement were
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
removed um my guess is that anyone who
 
06:38:50.070 --> 06:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
can get themselves four walls will be
 
06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
applying for a license to sell beer and
 
06:38:56.270 --> 06:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
wine um knowing that the only thing they
 
06:38:59.070 --> 06:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
have to have is four walls and it it is
 
06:39:00.750 --> 06:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant
 
06:39:04.388 --> 06:39:04.398 align:start position:0%
change that will have the impact of
 
06:39:06.510 --> 06:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
Greater sales certainly you'll probably
 
06:39:10.310 --> 06:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
see um initially people uh getting into
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
the marketplace they'll be strict
 
06:39:14.310 --> 06:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
competition and eventually some of these
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
businesses that jump in are going to
 
06:39:18.510 --> 06:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
fail because it's going to be who can
 
06:39:22.388 --> 06:39:22.398 align:start position:0%
provide the lowest price and um of of
 
06:39:24.830 --> 06:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
course that leads to the potential of
 
06:39:26.230 --> 06:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
Greater opportunity for underage
 
06:39:28.510 --> 06:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
drinking and underage
 
06:39:32.310 --> 06:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
access uh so I I can I can see those
 
06:39:34.830 --> 06:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
types of uh issues I can't necessarily
 
06:39:37.070 --> 06:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
predict with any certainty sir what type
 
06:39:39.030 --> 06:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
of additional Revenue might be produced
 
06:39:42.388 --> 06:39:42.398 align:start position:0%
by this type of change just one further
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
observation or question further question
 
06:39:49.350 --> 06:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
may inquire it would seem to me uh and
 
06:39:52.670 --> 06:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I I want your opinion on this that
 
06:39:54.670 --> 06:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
if you ended up with
 
06:39:56.868 --> 06:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh six stores now they're all selling
 
06:39:59.310 --> 06:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
nothing but beer and wine that there
 
06:40:02.750 --> 06:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
would open up a market for an actual
 
06:40:02.760 --> 06:40:04.310 align:start position:0%
would open up a market for an actual
grocery

06:40:04.310 --> 06:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
grocery
 
06:40:07.388 --> 06:40:07.398 align:start position:0%
store uh so I think the market would
 
06:40:10.230 --> 06:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
adjust I'm just I'm I'm not a big guy
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
having a I'm not in favor of having a
 
06:40:15.070 --> 06:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
package store on every
 
06:40:18.868 --> 06:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
corner but uh I know in Manchester uh we
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
almost do have that and uh a lot of
 
06:40:25.270 --> 06:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
stores are got very little in the way of
 
06:40:28.070 --> 06:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
food stuffs and a lot in the way of
 
06:40:32.628 --> 06:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and beer and uh and wine so I
 
06:40:35.788 --> 06:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
have I um I'm
 
06:40:38.388 --> 06:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
not I think what do you think the market
 
06:40:38.398 --> 06:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
not I think what do you think the market
would

06:40:39.830 --> 06:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:40:42.628 --> 06:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
do other than this first part you said
 
06:40:44.270 --> 06:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
well well they'll all be selling the
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
same stuff and they'll be you know going
 
06:40:48.948 --> 06:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
out of business because they can't get a
 
06:40:51.030 --> 06:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
margin but what would happen on the
 
06:40:53.310 --> 06:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
other side of the uh of the supermarket
 
06:40:53.320 --> 06:40:55.070 align:start position:0%
other side of the uh of the supermarket
aisle

06:40:55.070 --> 06:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
06:40:57.910 --> 06:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um it occurs to me that there might be
 
06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
the problem might be that they shouldn't
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
be competing with beer and wine and that
 
06:41:06.590 --> 06:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
there should be stores that are small
 
06:41:08.990 --> 06:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
but they're grocery stores we do have a
 
06:41:11.230 --> 06:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
few of those in Manchester too so where
 
06:41:13.430 --> 06:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
we go with this Chris I just I was just
 
06:41:15.788 --> 06:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
waned to know if you had an opinion on
 
06:41:18.270 --> 06:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
uh what the market might look like in a
 
06:41:20.548 --> 06:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
year if we actually pass
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
this um I really am not in a position
 
06:41:26.990 --> 06:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
great yeah that's I'm really not in
 
06:41:30.548 --> 06:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
position to answer that sir um yeah okay
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you though thank you for thank you
 
06:41:34.150 --> 06:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
for the question all right
 
06:41:36.830 --> 06:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weston thank you chairman
 
06:41:38.468 --> 06:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
hunt and thank you for taking my
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
question um representative aberson
 
06:41:43.708 --> 06:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned that hot food was not included
 
06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the $3,000 figure I'm wondering why
 
06:41:51.190 --> 06:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's not included and if there any other
 
06:41:56.708 --> 06:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
exemptions the def definition of of
 
06:41:56.718 --> 06:41:58.350 align:start position:0%
exemptions the def definition of of
um

06:41:58.350 --> 06:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:04.030 --> 06:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
1751 Roman 36 speaks to the types of
 
06:42:06.830 --> 06:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
things that they would want an eligible
 
06:42:10.350 --> 06:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
ly to hold um first it's a wholesale
 
06:42:12.150 --> 06:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
value not retail
 
06:42:16.110 --> 06:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
value um and it's $3,000 worth of
 
06:42:18.270 --> 06:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
commonly found grocery products not
 
06:42:20.190 --> 06:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
including cigarettes magazines
 
06:42:22.230 --> 06:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
newspapers wine or
 
06:42:24.270 --> 06:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
beverages the
 
06:42:28.388 --> 06:42:28.398 align:start position:0%
production of uh the uh many many stores
 
06:42:31.708 --> 06:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
for example um these days you may find
 
06:42:35.350 --> 06:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
some of them that have a uh they're a
 
06:42:36.868 --> 06:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
convenience store I'll think of you know
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
I have a son at UNH I go up there uh to
 
06:42:41.628 --> 06:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
visit him and there's a convenience
 
06:42:45.750 --> 06:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
store there that Irving which has uh
 
06:42:48.350 --> 06:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
many many grocery items uh and also
 
06:42:51.230 --> 06:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
within it has a Dunkin Donuts or it has
 
06:42:52.510 --> 06:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
hot dogs or
 
06:42:55.750 --> 06:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:59.628 --> 06:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
the application is if it's I think the
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
way we've interpreted it and applied it
 
06:43:03.590 --> 06:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
is that if it's subject to a rooms and
 
06:43:03.600 --> 06:43:04.548 align:start position:0%
is that if it's subject to a rooms and
meals

06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
meals
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
tax then we don't count it because it's
 
06:43:11.350 --> 06:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's coming in U and being uh taxed in
 
06:43:13.030 --> 06:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
that regard so it's it's a different
 
06:43:15.388 --> 06:43:15.398 align:start position:0%
category of
 
06:43:17.230 --> 06:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
food well I don't understand that
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
question what do you mean you don't
 
06:43:20.708 --> 06:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
count it wouldn't anything that's going
 
06:43:23.750 --> 06:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be collected as rooms and meals is
 
06:43:27.350 --> 06:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
well if if if we were I mean if if
 
06:43:30.990 --> 06:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
someone um I'll try to use an example to
 
06:43:34.270 --> 06:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
see if I can Illustrated if if someone
 
06:43:39.310 --> 06:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
has in their uh facility a cooler and
 
06:43:41.750 --> 06:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
the cooler has hot
 
06:43:45.430 --> 06:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
dogs um those would those would count
 
06:43:47.510 --> 06:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the owner of the store may take the hot
 
06:43:49.948 --> 06:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
dogs out of the cooler and then put them
 
06:43:52.590 --> 06:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
in the steamer and then sell them at
 
06:43:55.110 --> 06:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
retail um and those are subject to
 
06:43:57.110 --> 06:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
taxations but as long as they're
 
06:44:00.468 --> 06:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
available to the consumer as a grocery
 
06:44:02.990 --> 06:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
item they would
 
06:44:05.110 --> 06:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
count I'm not sure if I've answered your
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
question representative or no you
 
06:44:09.070 --> 06:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
answered it perfectly
 
06:44:14.468 --> 06:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:19.110 --> 06:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
muted I'm sorry representative I cannot
 
06:44:24.190 --> 06:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
hear you okay
 
06:44:26.948 --> 06:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm just
 
06:44:31.150 --> 06:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
trying to um figure this out uh $3,000
 
06:44:33.590 --> 06:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of groceries that's not very
 
06:44:36.868 --> 06:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
many at all and so that you know isn't
 
06:44:40.430 --> 06:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
too onerous for somebody to have $3,000
 
06:44:43.070 --> 06:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
worth of food and I don't know whether
 
06:44:46.628 --> 06:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
beverages include um whether in food you
 
06:44:49.868 --> 06:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
can include uh you know the mixers the
 
06:44:52.430 --> 06:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
Coke and the ginger ale and and the
 
06:44:54.910 --> 06:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
orange juice and all that that would all
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
count that would all count that would
 
06:44:59.070 --> 06:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
that would count as groceries yes ma'am
 
06:45:02.150 --> 06:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so it's very easy $3,000 isn't much
 
06:45:06.350 --> 06:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
of a bar to um to meet um it's hardly
 
06:45:10.310 --> 06:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
any groceries at all and um you could
 
06:45:15.310 --> 06:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
have uh you you could be a major um have
 
06:45:18.750 --> 06:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
every kind of specialty beer which isn't
 
06:45:22.310 --> 06:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily bad which is is very much uh
 
06:45:26.110 --> 06:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
What uh tourists and people coming to
 
06:45:30.030 --> 06:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
enjoy themselves anywhere in the state
 
06:45:32.830 --> 06:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
um they love it when they can go into a
 
06:45:37.388 --> 06:45:37.398 align:start position:0%
store and see a a vast
 
06:45:41.548 --> 06:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
array and variety of beers so and would
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
that be is that would be perfectly legal
 
06:45:46.948 --> 06:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
and be a convenience or a grocery store
 
06:45:49.948 --> 06:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
if you had $3,000 and that like I said
 
06:45:52.468 --> 06:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
$3,000 doesn't go very far that's a real
 
06:45:53.948 --> 06:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
small number
 
06:45:56.990 --> 06:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
would that be qualify as a a conven
 
06:45:59.270 --> 06:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
convenience or grocery store if you had
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
$3,000 worth of groceries and $200,000
 
06:46:05.350 --> 06:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
beer well uh thank you for your question
 
06:46:10.750 --> 06:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh the legislature has
 
06:46:15.070 --> 06:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
created a uh a creature called a beer
 
06:46:18.910 --> 06:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
specialty license and the beer specialty
 
06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
license um is a license that's a
 
06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
different license Li than the one that
 
06:46:27.310 --> 06:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
we're speaking of for
 
06:46:29.990 --> 06:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
17818 this particular license falls
 
06:46:30.000 --> 06:46:31.150 align:start position:0%
17818 this particular license falls
under

06:46:31.150 --> 06:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:46:35.708 --> 06:46:35.718 align:start position:0%
17819 hyphen D is in David and as a
 
06:46:38.190 --> 06:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that El for
 
06:46:42.788 --> 06:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
eligibility that business must have uh
 
06:46:47.350 --> 06:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
an inventory of 500 or more selected
 
06:46:47.360 --> 06:46:48.788 align:start position:0%
an inventory of 500 or more selected
beer

06:46:48.788 --> 06:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
beer
 
06:46:53.708 --> 06:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
labels and they too have a requirement
 
06:46:57.150 --> 06:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
for uh food uh and non-alcoholic
 
06:46:59.548 --> 06:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
beverages uh excuse me food which has a
 
06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale value of not less than
 
06:47:07.670 --> 06:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so from a policy standpoint I
 
06:47:11.230 --> 06:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
think the legislature has said if you're
 
06:47:13.948 --> 06:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
putting your money into inventory that
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
amounts to 500 distinct labels then
 
06:47:19.548 --> 06:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
we're not going to relieve you of your
 
06:47:22.150 --> 06:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for food we're just going to
 
06:47:25.468 --> 06:47:25.478 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that you need to carry
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
to be eligible to hold a license and in
 
06:47:29.868 --> 06:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:47:32.750 --> 06:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
case translate that into the combination
 
06:47:35.190 --> 06:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
license the legislature has said you can
 
06:47:37.388 --> 06:47:37.398 align:start position:0%
sell as much beer as you want you don't
 
06:47:39.388 --> 06:47:39.398 align:start position:0%
have to have a certain number you can
 
06:47:42.388 --> 06:47:42.398 align:start position:0%
have just one label if you want but to
 
06:47:45.150 --> 06:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
be eligible to sell as a combination
 
06:47:48.750 --> 06:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
license to sell beer and wine unlike the
 
06:47:51.190 --> 06:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
beer specialty store which sells only
 
06:47:53.830 --> 06:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
beer beer and wine you have to have the
 
06:47:57.830 --> 06:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
$3,000 worth of commonly found grocery
 
06:48:00.030 --> 06:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
products I hope I've answered your
 
06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
question yes yes thank you I just find
 
06:48:04.708 --> 06:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
it not an honorous amount of food to
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
have in order to become a would you
 
06:48:11.830 --> 06:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
believe become a a specialty place um
 
06:48:13.310 --> 06:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's wrong I'm not saying
 
06:48:16.270 --> 06:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'm against it but I wouldn't see the
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
$3,000 being a barrier thank you okay uh
 
06:48:20.878 --> 06:48:22.190 align:start position:0%
$3,000 being a barrier thank you okay uh

Ammon
 
06:48:26.708 --> 06:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:48:30.190 --> 06:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony um attorney Moore I'm
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
just curious about the enforcement of
 
06:48:34.830 --> 06:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
the $3,000 requirement you said it's
 
06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
wholesale value yes uh does someone come
 
06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
around with a calculator and a clipboard
 
06:48:43.350 --> 06:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it adds up to at
 
06:48:46.510 --> 06:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
least $3,000 um how is this
 
06:48:48.510 --> 06:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you uh thank you for your
 
06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
question representative uh the first
 
06:48:53.910 --> 06:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
place it would be uh you you'd encounter
 
06:48:56.670 --> 06:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
this would be at the time of initial
 
06:49:00.590 --> 06:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
licensing uh we would go in um and ask
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
the applicant uh because this is a
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
condition of their license to provide us
 
06:49:08.990 --> 06:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
with copies of or to show us invoices
 
06:49:12.388 --> 06:49:12.398 align:start position:0%
that show that they have uh met the
 
06:49:15.628 --> 06:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
prerequisite $3,000 in a wholesale
 
06:49:18.388 --> 06:49:18.398 align:start position:0%
figure um once that has occurred and the
 
06:49:23.750 --> 06:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
license is issued uh then the uh uh lcy
 
06:49:26.590 --> 06:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
would be subject to regular
 
06:49:30.310 --> 06:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
inspection and if that figure were to
 
06:49:34.270 --> 06:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
drop or if the if the uh
 
06:49:36.190 --> 06:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
investigator suspected that the
 
06:49:39.190 --> 06:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
inventory had uh lapsed
 
06:49:42.708 --> 06:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
significantly would probably uh let the
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
lensy know that this they were going to
 
06:49:46.868 --> 06:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
come back for an audit and they would
 
06:49:50.070 --> 06:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
look at then monitoring what was on the
 
06:49:52.830 --> 06:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
shelves what was available to the public
 
06:49:55.670 --> 06:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if it was below the
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
$3,000 uh certainly they would ask the
 
06:50:01.468 --> 06:50:01.478 align:start position:0%
licensing to get into compliance please
 
06:50:02.990 --> 06:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know this is a requirement of your
 
06:50:05.310 --> 06:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
license uh please get the levels up to
 
06:50:09.070 --> 06:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
where they need to go um over my career
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
with liquor enforcement um I encountered
 
06:50:15.150 --> 06:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
that many many times uh the goal was
 
06:50:16.948 --> 06:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
always to get the licensing in
 
06:50:19.388 --> 06:50:19.398 align:start position:0%
compliance uh not to put them out of
 
06:50:23.350 --> 06:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
business and um most of them were more
 
06:50:25.468 --> 06:50:25.478 align:start position:0%
than willing to try to make sure that
 
06:50:29.190 --> 06:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
they complied with the law uh for those
 
06:50:31.990 --> 06:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
who just didn't care they said you know
 
06:50:34.628 --> 06:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
I got my license and uh I'll do what I
 
06:50:36.910 --> 06:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
want to do well then there are other
 
06:50:39.070 --> 06:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
remedies available uh for those in
 
06:50:42.750 --> 06:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance as well so the initial
 
06:50:45.190 --> 06:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
determination is made at at lure initial
 
06:50:48.150 --> 06:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
lure and then during reg regular uh
 
06:50:49.910 --> 06:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up inspections if there's a
 
06:50:52.350 --> 06:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
question then they would ask the license
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
he to be participating in inventory to
 
06:50:56.990 --> 06:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
try to bring them into compliance
 
06:51:01.030 --> 06:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
followup question further question what
 
06:51:02.548 --> 06:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
what would you estimate uh the
 
06:51:05.910 --> 06:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh costs as far as uh
 
06:51:05.920 --> 06:51:07.150 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh costs as far as uh
resources

06:51:07.150 --> 06:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:51:10.990 --> 06:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:13.510 --> 06:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh to enforce this particular
 
06:51:16.388 --> 06:51:16.398 align:start position:0%
provision I I think it's part of the
 
06:51:19.750 --> 06:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
regular budget um Chief armaganian and
 
06:51:23.110 --> 06:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
his staff provide routine inspections
 
06:51:27.350 --> 06:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the year um their their plan
 
06:51:30.110 --> 06:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
is to certainly visit um every ly at
 
06:51:33.910 --> 06:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
least once and to ensure that the
 
06:51:36.548 --> 06:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the licensing system uh
 
06:51:40.750 --> 06:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
remains so I I can't give you a specific
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
cost on what one inspection might cost
 
06:51:46.350 --> 06:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly tell you that it's
 
06:51:48.388 --> 06:51:48.398 align:start position:0%
part of the regular enforcement duties
 
06:51:51.230 --> 06:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
carried out by uh that
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
division okay thank you
 
06:51:54.160 --> 06:51:55.750 align:start position:0%
division okay thank you
representative

06:51:55.750 --> 06:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:51:57.868 --> 06:51:57.878 align:start position:0%
gson thank you Mr Moore for answering
 
06:52:02.670 --> 06:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
our questions today uh is a store that
 
06:52:06.910 --> 06:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
primarily sells grocery items required
 
06:52:10.350 --> 06:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
to stock $3,000 worth of alcohol and
 
06:52:13.468 --> 06:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and if not why do we require
 
06:52:16.350 --> 06:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
a store that primarily sells alcohol and
 
06:52:21.468 --> 06:52:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.468 --> 06:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:26.830 --> 06:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm G see if I can understand your
 
06:52:29.750 --> 06:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you um
 
06:52:32.750 --> 06:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
there there is no requirement for for
 
06:52:34.270 --> 06:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
the ly to carry a certain amount of
 
06:52:36.590 --> 06:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol they they carry what their what
 
06:52:39.788 --> 06:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
their store can support in the way of uh
 
06:52:43.388 --> 06:52:43.398 align:start position:0%
space and what their consumers want so
 
06:52:48.070 --> 06:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
if you're um if you're on a a border uh
 
06:52:50.070 --> 06:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
you will carry what you believe the
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
people who come across the border want
 
06:52:52.558 --> 06:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
people who come across the border want
um

06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:56.110 --> 06:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that there are also um
 
06:52:57.750 --> 06:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores that are in that
 
06:53:01.830 --> 06:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
vicinity who also are selling alcohol
 
06:53:04.270 --> 06:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
and so therefore your pricing is not
 
06:53:06.030 --> 06:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
going to be maybe as competitive as it
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
would be with the state certainly but
 
06:53:10.110 --> 06:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
you're offering convenience somebody
 
06:53:13.110 --> 06:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
wants to come in so we we don't um
 
06:53:16.910 --> 06:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
mandate what quantity of alcohol or what
 
06:53:19.030 --> 06:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
types of alcohol a license he carry it's
 
06:53:22.350 --> 06:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
up to them uh but we try to make sure
 
06:53:24.788 --> 06:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
that the system all of the licensing
 
06:53:27.310 --> 06:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
systems that we administer um that are
 
06:53:31.830 --> 06:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:35.510 --> 06:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
applied followup sir a question inquire
 
06:53:38.350 --> 06:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
y did you not just make representative
 
06:53:41.150 --> 06:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
abramson's case
 
06:53:44.510 --> 06:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
exactly to the tea of why we don't need
 
06:53:47.190 --> 06:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
$3,000 worth of food in a store that
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
sells beer wine because there are other
 
06:53:51.548 --> 06:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
places in town that sell the food at a
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
much cheaper price not eight for a box
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
of cereal Etc and I you just exactly
 
06:53:58.708 --> 06:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
laid it out and I don't even consume
 
06:54:00.430 --> 06:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol so please don't misunderstand I
 
06:54:02.190 --> 06:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
have no dog in this in this
 
06:54:05.388 --> 06:54:05.398 align:start position:0%
race that's so would you
 
06:54:08.270 --> 06:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe would you
 
06:54:10.868 --> 06:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
believe uh thank you for your question
 
06:54:13.350 --> 06:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't believe I've
 
06:54:17.468 --> 06:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
made representative abramson's case um I
 
06:54:20.150 --> 06:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think what I have tried to lay out for
 
06:54:23.830 --> 06:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
you is that the eligibility eligibility
 
06:54:27.070 --> 06:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
for lure uh exists across the board
 
06:54:28.948 --> 06:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
across the state so whether you're up in
 
06:54:30.910 --> 06:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh New Hampshire or CBR New
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you hold a license under
 
06:54:37.468 --> 06:54:37.478 align:start position:0%
17818 uh to be eligible you are expected
 
06:54:40.388 --> 06:54:40.398 align:start position:0%
to have $3,000 worth of commonly found
 
06:54:43.270 --> 06:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
grocery products at the time of lure and
 
06:54:47.310 --> 06:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
to maintain that during your licensing
 
06:54:50.110 --> 06:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
period you and your wish to change that
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
policy that's
 
06:54:51.600 --> 06:54:53.468 align:start position:0%
policy that's
certainly

06:54:53.468 --> 06:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%

Distributors all operating here in New
 
06:56:26.788 --> 06:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these include the small
 
06:56:29.030 --> 06:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
independent mom and pop operators as
 
06:56:32.468 --> 06:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
well as the large chain operated groups
 
06:56:34.468 --> 06:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
um we appear here today we have some
 
06:56:36.350 --> 06:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill eliminating the
 
06:56:38.270 --> 06:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
inventory required by Grocery and
 
06:56:40.590 --> 06:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
convenience stores therefore as you
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned chairman uh we are here today
 
06:56:46.590 --> 06:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill um our
 
06:56:49.270 --> 06:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
association and its members realize the
 
06:56:51.948 --> 06:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
serious nature of selling baren wine and
 
06:56:53.990 --> 06:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
the impact that can have on individuals
 
06:56:56.708 --> 06:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
and the community at large Grocers have
 
06:56:58.468 --> 06:56:58.478 align:start position:0%
always supported the concept that these
 
06:57:00.070 --> 06:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
products are better utilized as part of
 
06:57:02.670 --> 06:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
a meal rather than being promoted as a
 
06:57:05.590 --> 06:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
sole item to consume that's why you see
 
06:57:07.510 --> 06:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants and food stores regularly
 
06:57:09.310 --> 06:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
promoting pairings when they offer these
 
06:57:12.190 --> 06:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
items for sale um the requirement of
 
06:57:14.388 --> 06:57:14.398 align:start position:0%
having a minimum inventory of consumable
 
06:57:16.510 --> 06:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
food products in order to sell beer and
 
06:57:18.910 --> 06:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
wine addresses just that important
 
06:57:21.468 --> 06:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
concept it encourages the responsible
 
06:57:23.388 --> 06:57:23.398 align:start position:0%
consumption of alcohol alol that does
 
06:57:25.350 --> 06:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
does not exist in other states which
 
06:57:28.270 --> 06:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
allow simply package stores the
 
06:57:30.150 --> 06:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
association of having food with any
 
06:57:32.150 --> 06:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverage discourages the
 
06:57:34.990 --> 06:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
notion of binge drinking in addition
 
06:57:37.030 --> 06:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
retail establishments where alcohol is a
 
06:57:39.110 --> 06:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
sole product each sale becomes more
 
06:57:40.948 --> 06:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
important and could lead to Greater
 
06:57:42.830 --> 06:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement
 
06:57:47.070 --> 06:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
violations today as uh Aiden Moore had
 
06:57:48.830 --> 06:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are approximately 1,400
 
06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
off- premise licenses in the state these
 
06:57:52.750 --> 06:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
are essentially your growth Grocery and
 
06:57:55.070 --> 06:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
convenience stores a substantial
 
06:57:56.590 --> 06:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
majority of these are the small
 
06:57:59.388 --> 06:57:59.398 align:start position:0%
independent mom and pop type retailers
 
06:58:00.990 --> 06:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
many of them dependent upon a few
 
06:58:02.670 --> 06:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
categories to draw their customers to
 
06:58:05.388 --> 06:58:05.398 align:start position:0%
the stores these stores understand the
 
06:58:07.230 --> 06:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
impact that alcohol can have on their
 
06:58:09.430 --> 06:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
survival and go to Great Lengths to
 
06:58:11.788 --> 06:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
ensure that only legal sales are
 
06:58:14.510 --> 06:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
made we as an association have always
 
06:58:16.708 --> 06:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
defended having grocery inventory as a
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
requirement to sell be wine back in the
 
06:58:21.910 --> 06:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
70s we even supported legislation
 
06:58:24.150 --> 06:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
provided that the groceries were a mix
 
06:58:26.750 --> 06:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
of common food items this was done to
 
06:58:29.230 --> 06:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that you do not buy only
 
06:58:30.788 --> 06:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
expensive items and leave them on the
 
06:58:33.430 --> 06:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
Shelf your Kansas bam your Vienna
 
06:58:35.948 --> 06:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
sausage um thus circumventing the law
 
06:58:38.670 --> 06:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
and becoming a pseudo package store this
 
06:58:40.510 --> 06:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
also helps out consumers in the small
 
06:58:42.430 --> 06:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
rural towns who may have limited access
 
06:58:45.388 --> 06:58:45.398 align:start position:0%
to retail stores and even worse limited
 
06:58:47.230 --> 06:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation this allows those
 
06:58:48.750 --> 06:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
consumers to know they'll have a place
 
06:58:52.548 --> 06:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
to get necessary items when needed um I
 
06:58:53.750 --> 06:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
made a couple of notes when
 
06:58:57.310 --> 06:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson was talking um
 
06:58:59.548 --> 06:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
in regards to having room for New
 
06:59:00.910 --> 06:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made
 
06:59:03.230 --> 06:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
items there's nothing stopping these
 
06:59:05.548 --> 06:59:05.558 align:start position:0%
businesses now from stocking and selling
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire made items there are
 
06:59:09.190 --> 06:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
plenty of them that are consumable
 
06:59:10.628 --> 06:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
plenty of them that would fall within
 
06:59:13.468 --> 06:59:13.478 align:start position:0%
those parameters um in regards to Dusty
 
06:59:16.670 --> 06:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
cansas spam in Vienna sausages um you
 
06:59:18.708 --> 06:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
know Common business practice goes to
 
06:59:20.548 --> 06:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
say you know if stocking these items
 
06:59:22.830 --> 06:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
aren't moving then you know we should
 
06:59:24.708 --> 06:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
reevaluate what we sell and have an
 
06:59:26.990 --> 06:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
inventory and stock those items whether
 
06:59:28.868 --> 06:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
we differentiate ourselves from our
 
06:59:30.548 --> 06:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
competitor that's right down the street
 
06:59:32.830 --> 06:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
or the five competitors surrounding us
 
06:59:34.830 --> 06:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
or we're the only one if an item's not
 
06:59:36.270 --> 06:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
moving gets
 
06:59:38.590 --> 06:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated um reassessed and then we
 
06:59:41.110 --> 06:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
stock items that we think will move in
 
06:59:43.310 --> 06:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
closing the current statute has a very
 
06:59:45.110 --> 06:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
practical purpose and should not be
 
06:59:47.628 --> 06:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
eliminated by this bill because of this
 
06:59:49.070 --> 06:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
we hope that you find this bill
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'll feeli any questions uh
 
06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative burough has a question
 
06:59:59.990 --> 07:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure yes thanks for taking my question
 
07:00:02.270 --> 07:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I understand what you're saying about
 
07:00:05.070 --> 07:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
um encouraging people to eat food while
 
07:00:07.430 --> 07:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know when they buy alcohol it's
 
07:00:09.350 --> 07:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
better to do that than to to drink
 
07:00:11.868 --> 07:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
without food but wouldn't that also be
 
07:00:13.510 --> 07:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
an argument for dismantling New
 
07:00:16.070 --> 07:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire liquor stores that don't sell
 
07:00:18.510 --> 07:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
food that's not my purvey that would be
 
07:00:21.310 --> 07:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
another bill to get Spirits into grocery
 
07:00:24.590 --> 07:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.070 --> 07:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
pun well they've already with some
 
07:00:30.468 --> 07:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
controversy they've already expanded by
 
07:00:33.150 --> 07:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
adding adding uh the
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic uh mixers and things like
 
07:00:37.628 --> 07:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
that that they have held off for a very
 
07:00:39.150 --> 07:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
long time
 
07:00:41.948 --> 07:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
right so uh representative
 
07:00:46.230 --> 07:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
Abel thank you uh thank you um and thank
 
07:00:49.990 --> 07:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr dagel for for your testimony um
 
07:00:53.388 --> 07:00:53.398 align:start position:0%
when uh issue similar to this bills
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
similar to this have come up in the last
 
07:01:02.708 --> 07:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
several uh sessions um I recall that uh
 
07:01:05.030 --> 07:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
there was argu there was argument given
 
07:01:05.040 --> 07:01:06.350 align:start position:0%
there was argu there was argument given
that

07:01:06.350 --> 07:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:09.468 --> 07:01:09.478 align:start position:0%
um that there are food deserts in in New
 
07:01:11.628 --> 07:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as there are everywhere else
 
07:01:15.590 --> 07:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
both in urban areas and in rural areas
 
07:01:20.030 --> 07:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that some people had a fear that
 
07:01:26.070 --> 07:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
that uh stores in in such places would
 
07:01:28.510 --> 07:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
stop selling food because they could
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
make more money selling selling beer and
 
07:01:36.030 --> 07:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
wine and this was a a an ATT one reason
 
07:01:38.948 --> 07:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
why we wanted to encourage those stores
 
07:01:42.388 --> 07:01:42.398 align:start position:0%
to continue to sell food am I right or
 
07:01:45.468 --> 07:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
wrong in In My Memory no you are
 
07:01:47.708 --> 07:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct representative and in
 
07:01:50.388 --> 07:01:50.398 align:start position:0%
great great question um there are food
 
07:01:54.590 --> 07:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
deserts U mainly up north um Northwest
 
07:01:57.990 --> 07:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
areas of the state um the concerns come
 
07:02:02.230 --> 07:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
even foremost with uh those that are on
 
07:02:04.910 --> 07:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh assistance whether it's you know EBT
 
07:02:08.868 --> 07:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
funds or or Wick type funding um being
 
07:02:10.510 --> 07:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
in those areas where there's only one
 
07:02:13.910 --> 07:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
local store um eliminating that need to
 
07:02:16.670 --> 07:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
have you know a grocery inventory though
 
07:02:18.990 --> 07:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
they may seem that they have the
 
07:02:21.670 --> 07:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
clientele there you're right um they may
 
07:02:24.230 --> 07:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
just become a package store um now
 
07:02:29.230 --> 07:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
leaving these folks without access to to
 
07:02:31.948 --> 07:02:31.958 align:start position:0%

that I think those of you that have been
 
07:03:19.270 --> 07:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
around and and heard me testify not only
 
07:03:23.190 --> 07:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
at this job but uh at my State Police
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
position prior to this uh my platform
 
07:03:28.708 --> 07:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
has always been Community safety and
 
07:03:33.110 --> 07:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
keeping your community sa um the pairing
 
07:03:37.548 --> 07:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
of food requirement and alcohol has
 
07:03:41.350 --> 07:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
always been Nationwide has been a
 
07:03:44.468 --> 07:03:44.478 align:start position:0%
industry standard um does the dollar
 
07:03:46.510 --> 07:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
amount move yeah the dollar amount does
 
07:03:48.590 --> 07:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
move and that requirement moves a little
 
07:03:52.468 --> 07:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
bit but the standard of having
 
07:03:55.910 --> 07:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
with whether we're talking um restaurant
 
07:04:00.310 --> 07:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
or cocktail lounge um or um or a
 
07:04:03.868 --> 07:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
combination license such as this um that
 
07:04:07.030 --> 07:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
food requirement is is literally about
 
07:04:11.670 --> 07:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
keeping your community safe and and
 
07:04:14.468 --> 07:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
offsetting um the the consumption of
 
07:04:17.628 --> 07:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol with with a salad with
 
07:04:22.670 --> 07:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
food um it and there was a a
 
07:04:24.468 --> 07:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
a statement made
 
07:04:30.030 --> 07:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
about um compliance earlier um I I
 
07:04:33.270 --> 07:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative am was at you um as far
 
07:04:35.590 --> 07:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
as holding licensing accountable I know
 
07:04:37.868 --> 07:04:37.878 align:start position:0%

everybody's uh contact with with liquor
 
07:04:54.830 --> 07:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement in previous administrations
 
07:05:00.070 --> 07:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
I know uh aen Moore former Chief um uh
 
07:05:01.788 --> 07:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
can speak very well about his
 
07:05:04.750 --> 07:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
administration but this Administration
 
07:05:08.310 --> 07:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
is all about making sure that number one
 
07:05:11.590 --> 07:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
your leny is educated and our consumers
 
07:05:13.150 --> 07:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
and our servers are
 
07:05:16.030 --> 07:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
educated um we're not coming in like the
 
07:05:18.830 --> 07:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
big bad wolf and hanging for a lack of a
 
07:05:21.548 --> 07:05:21.558 align:start position:0%
better term hanging paper on everybody
 
07:05:24.150 --> 07:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
um whether it's covid times or any other
 
07:05:27.030 --> 07:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
times it's literally just trying to get
 
07:05:29.708 --> 07:05:29.718 align:start position:0%
them into compliance just again with
 
07:05:33.628 --> 07:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
that that overtone of safety um and that
 
07:05:37.548 --> 07:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
is a yeah Aiden did a very good job um
 
07:05:39.548 --> 07:05:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh talking about
 
07:05:42.548 --> 07:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
compliance um and and we have Auditors
 
07:05:44.590 --> 07:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
that actually civilian Auditors that go
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
out uh representative so uh we're not
 
07:05:50.150 --> 07:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
paying we're being fiscally responsible
 
07:05:52.230 --> 07:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
and not paying the money of an
 
07:05:55.468 --> 07:05:55.478 align:start position:0%
investigator when a civilian auditor can
 
07:05:58.190 --> 07:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
go out and do the same job and if there
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
is a administrative action I could tell
 
07:06:02.788 --> 07:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
you that Administration is way down the
 
07:06:06.388 --> 07:06:06.398 align:start position:0%
road um because we give I hate to give
 
07:06:08.110 --> 07:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
the answers to the test but we give a
 
07:06:12.468 --> 07:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:14.948 --> 07:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
lenses and everybody did a great job
 
07:06:16.750 --> 07:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
testifying I just needed to say that I
 
07:06:18.910 --> 07:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
know it's been a long day but your
 
07:06:22.110 --> 07:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
questions have been awesome and and
 
07:06:24.510 --> 07:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the testifying that has been
 
07:06:25.948 --> 07:06:25.958 align:start position:0%
going on I've been sitting on the
 
07:06:27.708 --> 07:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
sidelines here
 
07:06:30.708 --> 07:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
listening everybody's taken a a concern
 
07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
effort and and all the bills that have
 
07:06:35.868 --> 07:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
come before you and I can't tell you how
 
07:06:38.868 --> 07:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
much I as the head of this agency
 
07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because it's obvious it
 
07:06:43.430 --> 07:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
means something
 
07:06:46.190 --> 07:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
for thank you unless there are any
 
07:06:48.070 --> 07:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'll answer any
 
07:06:50.430 --> 07:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
questions so Chief I have a question and
 
07:06:52.150 --> 07:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
I guess I should know this answer but I
 
07:06:54.628 --> 07:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
don't know it just kind of dawned on me
 
07:06:57.388 --> 07:06:57.398 align:start position:0%
um because I had forgotten that we that
 
07:07:01.030 --> 07:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything that collected rooms and meals
 
07:07:03.150 --> 07:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
is uh not considered
 
07:07:06.708 --> 07:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
groceries and if if our public policy is
 
07:07:08.388 --> 07:07:08.398 align:start position:0%
that we really want people to be eating
 
07:07:11.868 --> 07:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
something wouldn't make sense for us to
 
07:07:13.868 --> 07:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
uh bring in you know that that if they
 
07:07:15.990 --> 07:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
did have sandwiches pre-made sandwiches
 
07:07:18.310 --> 07:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
and if they did have you know the hot
 
07:07:20.590 --> 07:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
dogs and the burritos I think I've had a
 
07:07:23.388 --> 07:07:23.398 align:start position:0%
burrito that if if they wouldn't that be
 
07:07:25.948 --> 07:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
good that that that be considered part
 
07:07:28.230 --> 07:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
of a food because we certainly think
 
07:07:30.510 --> 07:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's good enough for restaurants you
 
07:07:33.590 --> 07:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
know restaurants so just plain Devils
 
07:07:36.150 --> 07:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
Havoc here but shouldn't I'm not sure
 
07:07:40.110 --> 07:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
could other Foods replace that might
 
07:07:45.868 --> 07:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
better fulfill this this um this action
 
07:07:49.590 --> 07:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I mean you you have the
 
07:07:52.310 --> 07:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are seven and I um put myself on
 
07:07:54.830 --> 07:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
the spot between cereals Dairy
 
07:07:59.070 --> 07:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
Meats uh breads snack foods vegetables
 
07:08:02.670 --> 07:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
fruits those are all part of uh I think
 
07:08:06.990 --> 07:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's liquor rule 404 I'm going say 2ish
 
07:08:09.708 --> 07:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
around there but it actually stipulates
 
07:08:13.030 --> 07:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
out what those requirements are those
 
07:08:14.948 --> 07:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
categories are that you need to have
 
07:08:19.150 --> 07:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
food in um but could that alter to the
 
07:08:21.510 --> 07:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
times absolutely it's some something
 
07:08:25.670 --> 07:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
that is uh easily consumable on the spot
 
07:08:29.510 --> 07:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
really does fulfill fulfill that need uh
 
07:08:31.868 --> 07:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
probably I would argue more so than
 
07:08:34.628 --> 07:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
something you had to CAU exactly exactly
 
07:08:36.708 --> 07:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
and that and was funny because when
 
07:08:37.990 --> 07:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative Herber says well what's
 
07:08:39.548 --> 07:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
the revenue loss and I was thinking well
 
07:08:41.708 --> 07:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals but if rooms and meals
 
07:08:45.350 --> 07:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
was never really included food um but
 
07:08:47.628 --> 07:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
what's more important to me is I I think
 
07:08:51.388 --> 07:08:51.398 align:start position:0%
the his history is that um at the time
 
07:08:52.948 --> 07:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
when we decided that we really did want
 
07:08:55.110 --> 07:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
to have beer and it wasn't wine it was
 
07:08:57.510 --> 07:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
just beer and we wanted we didn't want
 
07:08:58.990 --> 07:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
to have packies we didn't want to have
 
07:09:03.468 --> 07:09:03.478 align:start position:0%
somebody who solely sold beer and so we
 
07:09:05.430 --> 07:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
made the decision that we would give it
 
07:09:07.868 --> 07:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
to the convenience stores and then we
 
07:09:09.670 --> 07:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
had to to find who was what was a
 
07:09:11.868 --> 07:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
convenience store and at that time that
 
07:09:13.670 --> 07:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
was you know those were the igas those
 
07:09:16.070 --> 07:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
little Community igas which I'm old
 
07:09:18.030 --> 07:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
enough to remember I don't know most
 
07:09:20.350 --> 07:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
everybody here knows remembers igas but
 
07:09:22.868 --> 07:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
but um that that now when we really
 
07:09:24.430 --> 07:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
think about it if we want to make the
 
07:09:26.230 --> 07:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
case that it's about food we want them
 
07:09:28.110 --> 07:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
to eat something or something we really
 
07:09:30.110 --> 07:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
would rather have them eating something
 
07:09:32.510 --> 07:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
that they'll could act eat right away
 
07:09:35.030 --> 07:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
rather than have to take it home and and
 
07:09:36.910 --> 07:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
make it or bake it or whatever they have
 
07:09:39.270 --> 07:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
to do with which was what our food
 
07:09:41.868 --> 07:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
requirement is now AB absolutely Mr
 
07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
chairman very good point you need to fix
 
07:09:47.310 --> 07:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
your sound your sound was crappy sorry
 
07:09:50.030 --> 07:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
do I need to move closer closer sounds
 
07:09:50.948 --> 07:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
better yeah all of a sudden it was
 
07:09:52.628 --> 07:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
really iy or something some say I talk
 
07:09:55.388 --> 07:09:55.398 align:start position:0%
too much so that might be a good thing I
 
07:09:57.990 --> 07:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
would to that okay any other questions
 
07:10:01.548 --> 07:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
for uh Chief harag seeing none we thank

cake Kate and uh and uh and and feel
 
07:10:12.388 --> 07:10:12.398 align:start position:0%
free to tell us why you're opposed to
 
07:10:14.468 --> 07:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
everything else that you didn't testify
 
07:10:17.230 --> 07:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
for um yeah I just signed in on bills
 
07:10:18.868 --> 07:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
that I didn't want to take the
 
07:10:22.388 --> 07:10:22.398 align:start position:0%
committee's time I am test on bills that
 
07:10:24.430 --> 07:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
we feel strongly that we need to um
 
07:10:27.990 --> 07:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
oppose and House Bill 245 is one of them
 
07:10:29.430 --> 07:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you members of the committee
 
07:10:31.868 --> 07:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
I'll be as brief as I can and we'll try
 
07:10:33.910 --> 07:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
not to repeat because I know you've had
 
07:10:37.310 --> 07:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
a long day um we oppose this bill for
 
07:10:38.788 --> 07:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
many of the reasons that were cited
 
07:10:41.628 --> 07:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
today by The Liquor Commission and the
 
07:10:43.788 --> 07:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
Grocers Association I think it's
 
07:10:46.510 --> 07:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
important to remember and I appreciate
 
07:10:48.868 --> 07:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
um the chief's um history and actually
 
07:10:50.590 --> 07:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative hunt what he mentioned
 
07:10:52.868 --> 07:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
about the purp of the current grocery
 
07:10:56.190 --> 07:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
requirement was really uh important to
 
07:10:58.070 --> 07:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
both public health and safety and
 
07:11:00.788 --> 07:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
Community reputation and ensure that
 
07:11:02.670 --> 07:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
communities aren't burdened by a
 
07:11:05.350 --> 07:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
proliferation of package stores um that
 
07:11:07.948 --> 07:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
sells nothing but alcohol and tobacco
 
07:11:11.270 --> 07:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
products um so if this bill were to pass
 
07:11:13.350 --> 07:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
Our concern would be an increase of
 
07:11:16.468 --> 07:11:16.478 align:start position:0%
alcohol outlets and high alcohol Outlet
 
07:11:19.070 --> 07:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
density defined as a high concentration
 
07:11:21.350 --> 07:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
of retail alcohol outlets in a small
 
07:11:24.110 --> 07:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
area it can be environmental risk
 
07:11:26.510 --> 07:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
factors for excessive drinking we also
 
07:11:28.190 --> 07:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
know it's associated with many social
 
07:11:30.430 --> 07:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
harms among neighborhoods in and around
 
07:11:32.670 --> 07:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
the alcohol Outlet area such as
 
07:11:35.150 --> 07:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct noise violence public
 
07:11:37.590 --> 07:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
nuisance and we also know low-income
 
07:11:40.150 --> 07:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
minority communities often have a higher
 
07:11:43.190 --> 07:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
density of alcohol Outlets than um
 
07:11:46.310 --> 07:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
wealthier communities um and then
 
07:11:48.868 --> 07:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
therefore are kind of living within that
 
07:11:51.910 --> 07:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
um disproportionate access um and the
 
07:11:54.350 --> 07:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
harms that come out of that um so I
 
07:11:55.990 --> 07:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
think it's just really important to to
 
07:12:00.070 --> 07:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
stress that as well too um we seek to
 
07:12:02.030 --> 07:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
improve racial Health disparities among
 
07:12:04.230 --> 07:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
the marginalized groups but also ensure
 
07:12:06.110 --> 07:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
that all graned Staters are healthy now
 
07:12:08.670 --> 07:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
and into the future and so we really
 
07:12:11.388 --> 07:12:11.398 align:start position:0%
look at this as an important component
 
07:12:14.388 --> 07:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
of Public Health and um we would ask the
 
07:12:17.150 --> 07:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee to it
 
07:12:20.468 --> 07:12:20.478 align:start position:0%
it fair enough there any questions from
 
07:12:23.230 --> 07:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:25.150 --> 07:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry can I say one more thing
 
07:12:28.310 --> 07:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative of course I did just want
 
07:12:30.230 --> 07:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
to uh definitely underscore what
 
07:12:32.948 --> 07:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
representative AEL said too as well as
 
07:12:35.230 --> 07:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
the concern around creating food deserts
 
07:12:38.190 --> 07:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
in some of these um communities as
 
07:12:41.548 --> 07:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
well fair enough okay uh there any
 
07:12:43.510 --> 07:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
07:12:46.830 --> 07:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you all very much
 
07:12:48.230 --> 07:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh Republicans will remind you that we
 
07:12:51.750 --> 07:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
have a caucus at 5:30 and we'll get to
 
07:12:53.948 --> 07:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
do this all over again tomorrow at nine
 
07:12:58.070 --> 07:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock oh I speaking this bill 245 it
 
07:13:00.830 --> 07:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
had the three three supporters and five
 
07:13:05.350 --> 07:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
opposed um who were they're all mixed
 
07:13:08.468 --> 07:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
group and mutual so with that we'll
